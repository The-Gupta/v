While therapeutic efficacy and patient preference for this therapy type have been reported, there is a lack of knowledge about its effectiveness for lymphoma in clinical practice, particularly in regard to the effects of medication nonadherence. While studies of oral medications in other diseases have shown that adherence is a major factor in outcomes and costs, there is scant research investigating adherence specifically in lymphoma patients, who face unique challenges in their diseases and treatments. To address the limited data available, we constructed a conceptual model and highlighted key opportunities for future research to better elucidate oral therapy adherence in lymphoma. This research will hopefully improve understanding and efficacy of oral treatment for lymphoma patients, while also informing other cancers utilizing oral therapies currently and in the future.","['K24 CA208132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6791753,['NIHMS1536611'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Oral therapy', '*adherence', '*lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is a regulator for different biological responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), constitutive NF-kappaB has been detected in more than 50% of cases, enabling leukemic cells to resist apoptosis and stimulate uncontrolled proliferation. We evaluated NF-kB expression in bone marrow samples from 103 patients with AML using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found that expression was increased in 80.5% (83 out 103) of these patients with AML in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, overexpressed transmembrane glycoprotein (CD44) on leukemic cells in comparison to normal cells is known to play an important role in leukemic cell engraftment and survival. We designed poly lactide co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles conjugated with antiCD44 and encapsulating parthenolide (PTL), a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) inhibitor, in order to improve the selectivity and targeting of leukemic cells and to spare normal cells. In vitro, in leukemic cell lines Kasumi-1, KG-1a, and THP-1, proliferation was decreased by 40% (** p < 0.01) with 5 microM PLGA-antiCD44-PTL nanoparticles in comparison to the same concentration of free PTL (~10%). The higher uptake of the nanoparticles by leukemic cells was confirmed with confocal microscopy. In conclusion, PLGA-antiCD44-PTL nanoparticles improved the bioavailability and selective targeting of leukemic cells, thus holding promise as a drug delivery system to improve the cure rate of AML.",,PMC6600366,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'nanoparticles', 'nanoparticles with antiCD44 and encapsulating parthenolide', 'poly lactide co-glycolide', 'targeted therapy']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4124-9772', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2460-9422', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5684-9298', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9294-015X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to the introduction of advanced high-throughput techniques, light is being shed on the pathogenesis of AML, identifying molecular recurrent mutations as responsible for the onset, as well as progression, of disease. As a consequence, and in parallel, many new compounds, including targeted therapies (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-2 (IDH1-2) inhibitors), have found a wide room of application in this setting, and are now available in daily practice, or in late phases of clinical development. Moreover, several further innovative molecules are currently under investigation, and promising results for many of them have already been reported.

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with TKI interruptions/discontinuations of >/=4 continuous weeks (no clinical trial context) between May 2013 and May 2016. Data collection took place between October 2016 and February 2017. RESULTS: All 60 participants (69 interruptions/discontinuations) had chronic-phase CML and 75% had at least a major molecular response (>/=MMR) at interruption/discontinuation. Most interruptions/discontinuations occurred while on imatinib (36/69; 49%) and dasatinib (20/69; 29%). Most interruptions/discontinuations occurred due to side effects/intolerance (46/69; 67%); other reasons included a wish to conceive (6/69; 9%) and attempts to achieve treatment-free remission (TFR) (6/69; 9%). Interruptions due to side effects occurred later for imatinib- or dasatinib-treated patients than for those on nilotinib or ponatinib. Treatment was re-initiated in 62% (43/69) of cases. Most interruptions caused by side effects/intolerance were followed by treatment changes. All 4 patients with >/=MR 4.5 at interruption/discontinuation and >/=11-month follow-up who had not restarted treatment maintained the response. CONCLUSION: Although TKIs are used for long-term CML treatment, physicians sometimes recommend interruptions/discontinuations.

Epub 2019 Jun 1.,"Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has deleterious effects on pancreatic beta-cell function and survival in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) plays a critical role in beta-cell failure under diabetic milieu conditions. However, little information is available on CDK5's ability to impair the function of beta-cells via a chemical ER stress inducer thapsigargin. Myricetin, a natural flavonoid, has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we examined the effect of CDK5 on thapsigargin-induced beta-cell apoptosis, and explored the relationship between myricetin and CDK5. Exposure of beta cells with thapsigargin, induced a Src-mediated redox signaling (VAV2-Rac1-NOX) formation and CDK5 activation. Activated CDK5 induced antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) degradation which was associated with p66Shc serine 36 phosphorylation, causing beta cell apoptosis via mitochondrial dysfunction. Exposure of beta cells to myricetin resulted in an acute inhibition of Src-mediated redox signaling (VAV2-Rac1-NOX) formation and CDK5 activation. Myricetin inhibited CDK5 activation by directly binding to its ATP-binding pocket. Treatment with myricetin also enhanced the stability of Mcl-1 after thapsigargin treatment. Inhibition of CDK5 with myricetin or roscovitine, a CDK5 inhibitor attenuates thapsigargin induced p66Shc serine 36 phosphorylation and also reduced mitochondrial dysfunction by decreasing mitochondrial ROS and caspase-3 activation. In addition, myricetin was observed to enhance PDX-1 and insulin mRNA expression and potentiate glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Taken together, these findings indicate that thapsigargin-induced early molecular events lead to CDK5-p66Shc signalosome contributes to thapsigargin-induced pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Myricetin blocked thapsigargin induced CDK5-p66Shc signalosome formation and prevented pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that thapsigargin initiated CDK5-p66Shc signalosome mediates the pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and myricetin protects the pancreatic beta cells through the inhibition of CDK5-p66Shc signalosome.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cyclin dependent kinase 5', '*Endoplasmic reticulum stress', '*Myricetin', '*Oxidative stress']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2019 Jun 4.,"BACKGROUND: The MRD status detected using multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has crucial prognostic value for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in morphologic complete remission (CR). We designed a novel panel of antibodies to identify aberrant differentiation/maturation profiles of residual leukemia cells in patients who were not diagnosed at our institution, relapsed with an antigenic shift, or lack leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. METHODS: We compared the MRD status detected using MFC and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in the same 158 bone marrow samples collected from 44 AML patients carrying leukemia-specific fusion genes. The clinical performance of the MFC-based MRD status was analyzed in 168 AML patients who exhibited morphologic CR (135) or active disease (33) before HSCT. RESULTS: Strong concordance was found between MFC-based and RT-qPCR-based MRD status (kappa = 0.868). Among the patients displaying CR, the positive MRD status detected using MFC was correlated with a worse prognosis [HRs (P values) for relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival: 4.83 (<0.001), 2.23 (0.003), and 1.79 (0.049), respectively]; the prognosis was similar to patients with an active disease before HSCT. Patients with a positive MRD before HSCT might experience a benefit from developing chronic graft-vs-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of MRD using our self-built different-from-normal AML-MRD detection panel exhibited reliable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In addition, patients with a positive MRD status before transplantation may have higher risk of relapse and worse survival.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'minimal residual disease', 'multiparameter flow cytometry', 'relapse']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-1522'],['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 4.,"INTRODUCTION: The Sysmex XN-10 automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation) is routinely used in hematology laboratories to perform complete blood cell count with differential (CBC w/ diff). The sensitivity of this system for blast detection is unclear, since many prior studies evaluating the blast flagging capabilities of Sysmex XN series used the white precursor cell (WPC) channel, which is not cleared for use in the United States. METHODS: We assessed the blast flagging capabilities of the Sysmex XN-10 compared with CellaVision (a cell image analyzer)-assisted visual hematology results. We evaluated the following flags: ""blasts?/abnormal lymph?"" and ""immature granulocytes present"" and compared differences in turnaround time between methods. RESULTS: We collected data on 2239 CBC w/ diff Sysmex automated analyzer differential and CellaVision-assisted visual differential from the inpatient hematology-oncology population of a tertiary care medical center. Solely analyzing the first CBC/diff from each unique patient, both flags had a combined sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 50.2%, PPV of 21.7%, and NPV of 100%. The mean turnaround time for the automated differential was 19.5 minutes (SD 35.9 minutes) compared with 66.4 minutes for the CellaVision-assisted visual differential (SD 68.5 minutes; P < 0.001; Figure 1). CONCLUSION: The Sysmex XN-10 abnormal lymphocyte/blast and immature granulocytes flags had excellent sensitivity and acceptable specificity in detecting circulating blasts with shorter turnaround time than the CellaVision-assisted visual differential. Our study suggests that automated differentials performed on Sysmex XN-10 can replace visual differentials as a first-line screening method for blast detection with improved turnaround time in hematology-oncology populations.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cellavision', 'Sysmex XN', 'blast', 'cell image analysis', 'leukemia']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0697-9454', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4614-681X']",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 4.,"The deregulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transcriptional networks is a common theme in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Chromosomal translocations that alter the Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 gene (MLL1, MLL, KMT2A) occur in infant, childhood and adult leukemia and at the same time, wild-type MLL1 is a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis. Typically, the endogenous, wild-type (WT) MLL1 and MLL fusion oncoproteins (MLL-FPs) remain both expressed in leukemia. WT and MLL-FPs activate overlapping sets of target genes, presenting a challenge for the selective therapeutic targeting of leukemic cells. We previously demonstrated that endogenous MLL1 is not required for the maintenance of MLL-FP-driven AML but is required for normal HSC homeostasis. Here we address the role of MLL-FPs in the initiation of leukemia in the absence of endogenous MLL1. We show that loss of endogenous Mll1 results in a rapid decrease in expression of shared HSC/leukemia target genes, yet MLL-AF9 restores the expression of most of these target genes in the absence of WT MLL1, with the critical exception of Mecom/Evi1. These observations underscore the sufficiency of MLL-fusion oncoproteins for initiating leukemia, but also illustrate that WT MLL1 target genes differ in their ability to be re-activated by MLL-FPs.","['R01 CA224436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI129426/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6619971,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*H3K4', '*KMT2A', '*MLL', '*MLL1', '*histone methyltransferase', '*leukemia']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7638-2939'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adolescent and young adults' (AYA) ALL could benefit from a pediatric-inspired regimen with a higher rate of long-term remission. This retrospective study sought to investigate the efficacy of treatment of adult ALL in a single center over the past decade. We analyzed 107 ALL patients with a median age of 26 years (range 15-63 years). Of these, 67.3% received adult regimen and 32.7% received pediatric-inspired regimen. The median follow-up time was 11.6 months (range 1-120). Complete remission (CR) was similarly achieved in over 80% in both schemes. Relapse and refractory rates were higher in the adult group (75%) than in the pediatric (45.7%) group. Two-year disease-free survival in the pediatric group was significantly superior to the adult group (47.1% vs 24.7%, hazard ratio [HR], 1.73, 95% CI 1.22-3.03). Two-year overall survival was higher in pediatric group as compared to adult group (50.8% versus 31.2%, HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.83-2.78).

Nevertheless, from one-fourth to half of newly diagnosed ALL patients have no visible chromosomal changes detectable by G-banding analysis at diagnosis. The introduction of powerful molecular methodologies has shown that many karyotypically normal ALLs carry clinically important submicroscopic aberrations. Case presentation: We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), RNA sequencing, reverse transcription (RT) and genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as Sanger sequencing to investigate a case of pediatric ALL with a normal karyotype. FISH with a commercial PDGFRB breakapart probe showed loss of the distal part of the probe suggesting a breakpoint within the PDGFRB locus. aCGH revealed submicroscopic deletions in chromosome bands 5q32q35.3 (about 30 Mb long, starting within PDGFRB and finishing in the CANX locus), 7q34 (within TCRB), 9p13 (PAX5), 10q26.13 (DMBT1), 14q11.2 (TRAC), and 14q32.33 (within the IGH locus). RNA sequencing detected an in-frame GTF2I-PDGFRB and an out-of-frame IKZF1-TYW1 fusion transcript. Both fusion transcripts were verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing and interphase FISH. The GTF2I-PDGFRB fusion was also verified by genomic PCR and FISH. The corresponding GTF2I-PDGFRB fusion protein would consist of almost the entire GTF2I and that part of PDGFRB which harbors the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase. It would therefore seem to lead to abnormal tyrosine kinase activity in a manner similar to what has been seen for other PDGFRB fusion proteins. Conclusions: The examined pediatric leukemia is a Ph-like ALL which carries novel GTF2I-PDGFRB and IKZF1-TYW1 fusion genes together with additional submicroscopic deletions. Because hematologic neoplasms with PDGFRB-fusion genes can be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the detection of such novel fusions may be clinically important. Since the GTF2I-PDGFRB could be detected only after molecular studies of the leukemic cells, further investigations of ALL-cases, perhaps especially but not exclusively with a normal karyotype, are needed in order to determine the frequency of GTF2I-PDGFRB in leukemia, and also to find out which clinical impact the fusion may have.",,PMC6542082,,['NOTNLM'],"['Array comparative genomic hybridization', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'Fusion genes', 'GTF2I-PDGFRB', 'IKZF1-TYW1', 'Normal karyotype', 'Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'RNA sequencing', 'Submicroscopic deletions']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2159-5341'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been widely used in clinical practice, but in recent years, it has caused more and more adverse reactions, mainly manifested as pseudo-allergic symptoms. To explore the potential mechanism of the pseudo-allergic reaction by QKLI, basophilic leukemia cell line 2H3 (RBL-2H3) was chosen. The results showed that QKLI at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mL L(-1) activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and also increased the levels of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), p21 protein-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), LIM kinase (Limk1) and cofilin (an actin polymerization regulator) proteins. What's more, QKLI aggravated the depolymerization of F-actin. NSC23766, a Rac1 inhibitor, reversed the previous results in QKLI-treated RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, when the Rac1 gene was knocked down using lentiviral vector-loaded shRNA in RBL-2H3 cells, the PI3K activity and depolymerization of F-actin were downregulated, hinting that the pseudo-allergic reaction was significantly reduced. In general, the pseudo-allergic reaction induced by QKLI was likely to be based on PI3K-Rac1 signaling pathways partially.",,PMC6505390,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5027-6596'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis is important for the evaluation of the response to therapy and the identification of an early reemergence of disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed cases of AML were included in the study. Diagnosis of AML was based on morphology on bone marrow (BM) aspirates, cytochemistry, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Chromosomal analysis was performed on BM by short-term unstimulated cultures using standard cytogenetic technique. RESULTS: There were 25 males and 13 females with age group between 15 and 64 years. Cytogenetic analysis of these cases showed normal karyotype in 10 (26.3%) cases and abnormal karyotype in 28 (73.6%) cases. Cytogenetic finding in AML was divided into three groups: favorable risk, intermediate risk, and unfavorable risk. Patients in the standard risk group responded well to the chemotherapy while patients with intermediate and unfavorable karyotype had relapsed. CONCLUSION: We recommend that cytogenetics should be performed routinely in all cases of AML. A correlation must be done with various biochemical and hematological parameters, immunophenotyping, and BM morphology. Molecular studies must be integrated with cytogenetic studies for risk stratification at diagnosis to improve therapeutic strategies.",,PMC6543945,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytogenetics', 'immunophenotyping']",,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) entails a poor prognosis. Treating these cases is challenging due to lack of effective therapies and, in some cases, poor performance status and/or presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), among others. No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has ever been conducted comparing a second allo-HCT against other treatments. Existing data are mainly from observational studies or registries. Success of a second allo-HCT is dependent on appropriately selecting patients who might achieve best outcomes with reasonable non-relapse mortality (NRM) risk. Several factors are associated with worse outcomes, namely a shorter time from first allo-HCT to relapse or to the second allo-HCT, and AML not being in complete hematologic remission (CR). Patients relapsing earlier than 6 months or having active/persistent disease should be enrolled in clinical trials. Limitations of the published literature include retrospective small size studies, a heterogeneous population, and absence of information on somatic mutations, among others. Future studies assessing the role of a second allo-HCT should evaluate the impact of IDH1, IDH2, or others on outcomes; and the feasibility and efficacy of targeted therapies in the pre-, peri-, or post-second allo-HCT setting.",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7394-5185'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 109 responding centers, 106 used busulfan for conditioning, 102 in conventional myeloablative doses, and 93 in reduced doses (RIC). The route of administration was mostly intravenous, but ~10% of the centers gave the drug orally. The number of doses in i.v. administration varied and was in myeloablative conditioning mostly one (50 centers) or four (43 centers) doses a day. Seventeen of the 106 centers used pharmacokinetics for dose adjustment in myeloablative conditioning, nine in RIC. The details of pharmacokinetic monitoring varied markedly. Three quarters of the centers reported adjusting the dose based on obesity in myeloablative conditioning and about 60% in RIC. The most common method for dose calculation was ideal body weight + 0.25 x (actual body weight - ideal body weight). In conclusion, the present survey showed marked heterogeneity in the current practices of busulfan administration for conditioning. The impact of the heterogeneity is not well known. Due to this and the scarcity of support from controlled clinical studies, no clear guidelines can be presented, but some prevailing policies to be recommended were identified.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4737-1103', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7025-1735', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3858-8180']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that expression of the mammalian pro-apoptotic factor, B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), can induce apoptosis in specific tissues by using tissue specific promoters in silkworm and mosquito. Here, we newly identified a functional promoter in the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, which enables gene expression specifically in the testis. We produced a transgenic mosquito line that expresses mouse Bax under the control of this testis-specific promoter. Transgenic mosquito males exhibited aberrant testes without functional sperm and complete sterility, whereas transgenic females maintained normal fecundity. Despite their abnormal testes, the transgenic males maintained normal function of male accessory glands and typical mating behaviour. As a result of mating with these males, females showed refractoriness to further mating. These results suggest that transgenic males induce female sterility via mating. The mosquito is one of the most important disease vectors, and the control of their population benefits global public health. Thus, this Bax-mediated synthetic male-specific sterilization system could be applied to population control of mosquitoes.",,PMC6547752,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4347-7808'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Riding on this success, the field of immune cell engineering is rapidly growing, with creative solutions to major outstanding challenges, such as limitations in target antigen selection, the hostility of the tumor microenvironment and the logistical challenges of generating autologous therapies. Innovations in antigen receptor design, coupled with advances in gene transfer and gene-editing technologies, have enabled the engineering of T cells to have sophisticated sensing circuits, to have synthetic functionalities, and to be used as off-the-shelf, universal cellular products. As these technologies are applied to other immune cells, such as natural killer cells, hematopoietic cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, the potential to transform the treatment of many cancers, as well as other diseases, is palpably exciting.

However, whether loss of p53 in fact increases the response of MDS/AML cells to decitabine remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the role of p53 in MDS and AML cells treated with decitabine using mouse models for MLL-AF9-driven AML and mutant ASXL1-driven MDS/AML. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of p53 in MDS/AML cells did not increase, but rather decreased their sensitivity to decitabine. Forced expression of a dominant-negative p53 fragment (p53DD) in these cells also decreased their responses to decitabine, confirming that acute inhibition of p53 conferred resistance to decitabine in AML and MDS/AML cells. In contrast, MLL-AF9-expressing AML cells generated from bone marrow progenitors of Trp53-deficient mice were more sensitive to decitabine in vivo than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that long-term chronic p53 deficiency increases decitabine sensitivity in AML cells. Taken together, these data revealed a multifaceted role for p53 to regulate responses of myeloid neoplasms to decitabine treatment.",,PMC6547685,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0023-4013', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6116-7996', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0709-3188']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell line panels were established for basic research and drug development, but did not cover the full spectrum of leukemia and lymphoma. Therefore, we now developed a novel panel (LL-100), 100 cell lines covering 22 entities of human leukemia and lymphoma including T-cell, B-cell and myeloid malignancies. Importantly, all cell lines are unequivocally authenticated and assigned to the correct tissue. Cell line samples were proven to be free of mycoplasma and non-inherent virus contamination. Whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing of the 100 cell lines were conducted with a uniform methodology to complement existing data on these publicly available cell lines. We show that such comprehensive sequencing data can be used to find lymphoma-subtype-characteristic copy number aberrations, mRNA isoforms, transcription factor activities and expression patterns of NKL homeobox genes. These exemplary studies confirm that the novel LL-100 panel will be useful for understanding the function of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and to develop targeted therapies.",,PMC6547646,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5693-3032'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

apoptotic machinery promoting apoptosis. Treatment of patients suffering chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with this BCL-2 antagonist has revealed emergence of a drug-selected BCL-2 mutation (G101V) in some patients failing therapy. To understand the molecular basis of this acquired resistance we describe the crystal structures of venetoclax bound to both BCL-2 and the G101V mutant. The pose of venetoclax in its binding site on BCL-2 reveals small but unexpected differences as compared to published structures of complexes with venetoclax analogues. The G101V mutant complex structure and mutant binding assays reveal that resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152, with venetoclax binding restored by a E152A mutation. This provides a framework for considering analogues of venetoclax that might be effective in combating this mutation.","['1059331/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1079706/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '11131233/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1113577/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1156024/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1079560/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1116934/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', '1079700/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', 'SCOR 7015-18/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma', 'Society)/International', 'NA/Victorian Cancer Agency (VCA)/International', '1124178/Cancer Council Victoria/International']",PMC6547681,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1825-0182', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8033-9140', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1193-8147', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-5720', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2594-496X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Germline mutations in fundamental epigenetic regulatory molecules including DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) are commonly associated with growth disorders, whereas somatic mutations are often associated with malignancy. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in DNMT3A c.2312G > A; p.(Arg771Gln) carriers in a large Amish sibship with Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome (TBRS), their mosaic father, and 15 TBRS patients with distinct pathogenic de novo DNMT3A variants. This defined widespread DNA hypomethylation at specific genomic sites enriched at locations annotated as genes involved in morphogenesis, development, differentiation, and malignancy predisposition pathways. TBRS patients also displayed highly accelerated DNA methylation aging. These findings were most marked in a carrier of the AML-associated driver mutation p.Arg882Cys. Our studies additionally defined phenotype-related accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in two histone methyltransferase disorders: NSD1 Sotos syndrome overgrowth disorder and KMT2D Kabuki syndrome growth impairment. Together, our findings provide fundamental new insights into aberrant epigenetic mechanisms, the role of epigenetic machinery maintenance, and determinants of biological aging in these growth disorders.","['G1001931/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'RP-2016-07-011/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008924/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1002279/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K013807/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC6633263,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1235-8291', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3546-1726', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1257-5314', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6637-3411']",['(c) 2019 Jeffries et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trial demonstrated that 5 doses of vincristine and escalating IV methotrexate (MTX) without leucovorin rescue in the interim maintenance (IM) phases resulted in superior event-free survival (EFS) when compared with 2 doses of vincristine, oral (PO) MTX, PO mercaptopurine, and dexamethasone. This report describes a favorable outcome of this regimen in patients with Down syndrome (DS). Forty-four patients with DS were randomized to the arms containing PO MTX during IM, and 31 to those containing IV MTX. Ten-year EFS rates for patients with DS randomized to IV MTX vs PO MTX were 94.4% +/- 5.4% vs 81.5% +/- 6.6%, respectively. IV methotrexate with strict escalation parameters, as given in this study, was well tolerated, although the mean total tolerated dose received was lower in patients with DS than in those without DS.

Thirty-eight published clinical studies including 665 patients were eligible for response rate (RR) evaluation. The overall pooled RR of CD19-CAR-T cells was 72% (95% confidence interval: 62-77%). The various clinical parameters were analyzed. RR was 81% in ALL, 68% in lymphoma and 70% in CLL. RR in patients who received interleukin (IL)-2 was 70%, whereas in those who did not receive IL-2, it was 74%. RR was 75% with lymphodepletion and 56% without lymphodepletion.

METHODS: BM-MSCs were collected from three de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and three aplastic anemia patients (AA), which were cultivated by the whole bone marrow adherent method. Surface markers of BM-MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM); meanwhile, growth characteristics were observed with a phase contrast microscope, and population doubling time (PDT) was calculated. The optimal generation cells (P4) were used for the subsequent experiments. Recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-OCT4 was constructed and transferred into ALL MSCs by liposome transfection. The cells with stable and high expression of OCT4 were selected by G418 resistance screening and subcloning, of which the expression of OCT4 was verified by FCM, cellular immunofluorescence assay (CIFA), and RT-PCR. The expression of stemness-related transcription factors (TFs) (NANOG, SOX2) and the embryonic stem cell (ESC)-related surface markers (SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81) were analyzed by FCM, RT-PCR, and CIFA. Embryonic body (EB) formation was performed with the above cells, and triembryonic differentiation marker genes were evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The primary passage of AA MSCs grew more slowly and had longer PDT (16 days on average) than ALL MSCs (10 days on average). AA MSCs presented the same typical morphology and similar expression levels of specific mesenchymal markers as ALL MSCs, whereas the latter had a much better proliferative capacity in P4 cells (P < 0.05). Besides, the expression levels of surface markers in ALL MSCs were slightly higher than that in AA MSCs in P4, P7, and P10 cells (P < 0.05). Cell lines with stable and high expression of OCT4 were successfully established from ALL MSCs, which were confirmed by CIFA, FCM, and RT-PCR. Compared with untransfected parental MSCs, the mean expression levels of TFs in OCT4 overexpression MSCs were increased from 0.63 +/- 0.37% to 39.39 +/- 1.85% (NANOG) and from 14.34 +/- 2.44% to 91.45 +/- 4.56% (SOX2). The average expression levels of ESC surface markers were increased from 3.33 +/- 2.35%, 1.59 +/- 1.29%, and 1.46 +/- 0.86% to 84.98 +/- 9.2%, 57.28 +/- 6.72%, and 75.88 +/- 7.35% respectively for SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81, which were confirmed by CIFA analysis. Moreover, the OCT4 overexpression MSCs could form EBs ex vivo and express ectoderm (TUBB3, WNT1), mesoderm (Brachyury, TBX20), and endoderm (SPARC) genes. CONCLUSION: Ectopic high expression of transcription factor OCT4 in BM-MSCs may drive them to grow as ESC-like cells with ""stemness"" characteristics. Single OCT4 transfection can upregulate the expression of other stemness-related transcription factors such as NANOG and SOX2.",,PMC6547465,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow-derived MSCs', '*OCT4', '*Overexpression', '*Stemness', '*Transcription factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the emerging evidence of anticancer properties of LAB, very limited information is available on cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity of PM produced by L. plantarum. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of PM produced by six strains of L. plantarum on various cancer and normal cells are yet to be evaluated. METHODS: Postbiotic metabolites (PM) produced by six strains of L. plantarum were determined for their antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on normal human primary cells, breast, colorectal, cervical, liver and leukemia cancer cell lines via MTT assay, trypan blue exclusion method and BrdU assay. The toxicity of PM was determined for human and various animal red blood cells via haemolytic assay. The cytotoxicity mode was subsequently determined for selected UL4 PM on MCF-7 cells due to its pronounced cytotoxic effect by fluorescent microscopic observation using AO/PI dye reagents and flow cytometric analyses. RESULTS: UL4 PM exhibited the lowest IC50 value on MCF-7, RG14 PM on HT29 and RG11 and RI11 PM on HL60 cell lines, respectively from MTT assay. Moreover, all tested PM did not cause haemolysis of human, dog, rabbit and chicken red blood cells and demonstrated no cytotoxicity on normal breast MCF-10A cells and primary cultured cells including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mice splenocytes and thymocytes. Antiproliferation of MCF-7 and HT-29 cells was potently induced by UL4 and RG 14 PM respectively after 72 h of incubation at the concentration of 30% (v/v). Fluorescent microscopic observation and flow cytometric analyses showed that the pronounced cytotoxic effect of UL4 PM on MCF-7 cells was mediated through apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, PM produced by the six strains of L. plantarum exhibited selective cytotoxic via antiproliferative effect and induction of apoptosis against malignant cancer cells in a strain-specific and cancer cell type-specific manner whilst sparing the normal cells. This reveals the vast potentials of PM from L. plantarum as functional supplement and as an adjunctive treatment for cancer.",,PMC6547513,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antiproliferation', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Haemolysis', 'Lactobacillus plantarum', 'Postbiotic metabolites']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5309-0965'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 13.,"Introduction: The cost of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment is substantial and increasing. Inpatient treatment costs for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and intensive chemotherapy are the main cost drivers in AML, however this pattern may change as new, expensive oral therapies enter the market. Areas covered: The authors provide an overview of the healthcare costs in patients with AML treated with various modalities (intensive chemotherapy, allogeneic HSCT, low-intensity treatment and supportive care only). The authors review both the impact of the recently approved novel AML agents and an increasingly personalized treatment approach on healthcare resources. Finally, the authors discuss whether these treatments are cost-effective from a societal perspective and how the increase in AML-associated costs can potentially be slowed. Expert opinion: The direct healthcare costs of AML are substantial and vary depending on the treatment approach, the country studied, and in the United States, a patient's insurance status. Treatment costs have increased out of proportion to general inflation and this trend is likely going to continue or even accelerate. Societal consensus on cost-effectiveness is essential. It remains to be seen how advances in diagnostic techniques and the incorporation of novel agents will impact medical outcomes, costs and influence health policy.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*cost of illness', '*cost-effectiveness', '*economic burden', '*review', '*treatment costs']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8542-2944']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Group 1 (n = 440) consisted of healthy client-owned cats with outdoor access, predominantly from eastern Australia. Groups 2 (n = 38) and 3 (n = 51) consisted of a mixture of healthy and sick cats, group-housed in two separate rescue facilities in Sydney, Australia, tested following identification of index cases of FeLV infection in cats sourced from these facilities. Diagnostic testing for FeLV exposure/infection included p27 antigen testing using three different point-of-care FeLV kits and a laboratory-based ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing to detect FeLV proviral DNA in leukocytes, real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) testing to detect FeLV RNA in plasma, and neutralising antibody (NAb) testing. Cats were classified as FeLV-uninfected (FeLV-unexposed and presumptively FeLV-abortive infections) or FeLV-infected (presumptively regressive and presumptively progressive infections). In Group 1, 370 FeLV-unexposed cats (370/440, 84%), 47 abortive infections (47/440, 11%), nine regressive infections (9/440, 2%), and two progressive infections (2/440, 0.5%) were identified, and 12 FeLV-uninfected cats (12/440, 3%) were unclassifiable as FeLV-unexposed or abortive infections due to insufficient samples available for NAb testing. In Groups 2 and 3, 31 FeLV-unexposed cats (31/89, 35%), eight abortive infections (8/89, 9%), 22 regressive infections (22/89; 25%), and 19 progressive infections (19/89; 21%) were discovered, and nine FeLV-uninfected cats (9/89; 10%) were unclassifiable due to insufficient samples available for NAb testing. One of the presumptively progressively-infected cats in Group 3 was likely a focal FeLV infection. Two other presumptively progressively-infected cats in Group 3 may have been classified as regressive infections with repeated testing, highlighting the difficulties associated with FeLV diagnosis when sampling cats at a single time point, even with results from a panel of FeLV tests. These results serve as a reminder to Australian veterinarians that the threat of FeLV to the general pet cat population remains high, thus vigilant FeLV testing, separate housing for FeLV-infected cats, and FeLV vaccination of at-risk cats is important, particularly in group-housed cats in shelters and rescue facilities, where outbreaks of FeLV infection can occur.",,PMC6630418,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Australia', '*FeLV diagnosis', '*PCR', '*antigen testing', '*cats', '*feline leukaemia virus', '*veterinary science']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7400-1960', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0003-6930', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9750-4296', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9921-4986', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5234-1606']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 28.,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta belongs to a group of nuclear receptors that act as transcription factors. PPAR beta/delta plays a significant role in the regulation of female reproductive processes. It has been demonstrated that PPARbeta/delta is expressed in mouse, rat and porcine endometrium during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of selected PPARbeta/delta ligands on the expression of nuclear factor kappa (NF-kappaB) and selected cytokines - interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in the porcine endometrium on days 10-12 and 14-16 of the estrous cycle (mid- and late-luteal phases corresponding to the full activity and luteolysis of the corpus luteum, respectively) and pregnancy (maternal recognition of pregnancy and beginning of implantation, respectively). Endometrial slices were incubated in vitro in the presence of PPARbeta/delta agonist L-165,041 (1 or 10muM) or antagonist GW9662 (10muM). The expression of mRNA and protein of the immune response mediator in the tissues was determined by real-time PCR and Western Blot. In general, the PPARbeta/delta agonist inhibited endometrial NF-kappaB mRNA expression during all analyzed reproductive stages, but it did not change protein expression. In turn, the PPARbeta/delta antagonist increased NF-kappaB protein levels on days 10-12 of the estrous cycle or pregnancy. The presence of the PPARbeta/delta agonist stimulated mRNA expression of LIF, IL-1beta and IL-8 and decreased the expression of IL-6. The presence of PPARbeta/delta ligands had a varied effect on protein expression in different stages on the analyzed period. The obtained results indicate that PPARbeta/delta regulates the expression of endometrial NF-kappaB and selected cytokines in pigs. The effects of PPARbeta/delta ligands on immune response mediators varied subject to the reproductive status of females and could be associated with differences in endometrial receptivity.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytokines', 'Endometrium', 'Estrous cycle', 'NF-kappaB', 'PPARbeta/delta', 'Pregnancy']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, but its ligand has not yet been identified. Little is known about the role of the COUP-TFII nuclear receptor in cancer cells. In this study, we mapped the cistrome of COUP-TFII in three different cancer cells, namely breast cancer cells (MCF-7), myelogenous leukaemia cells (K562) and liver cancer cells (HepG2) using publicly available ChIP-seq data. Our results show that COUP-TFII co-localises with master transcription factors (TFs) in a cell-specific manner such as estrogen receptor alpha in MCF-7, hepatocyte nuclear factor alpha in HepG2, and GATA-binding factor in K562, while the shared, non-specific COUP-TFII binding sites are co-occupied by CTCF. We identified chromatin environments for these COUP-TFII and master TF co-bound sites together with COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound sites. Our results show that COUP-TFII and master TF co-bound sites are marked with active enhancer specific histone modifications (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), while COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound sites reveal active promoter specific histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me3). These results describe the genomic context and role of COUP-TFII in the cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Furthermore, we report that the VEGFA gene regulated by shared COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound regulatory elements is involved in long-range looping in a cell-type-independent manner. These findings provide a genomic insight into the regulation and angiogenic role of COUP-TFII.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['COUP-TFII/NR2F2', 'Cell-type-specific regulation', 'Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)', 'Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha)', 'Master transcription factor', 'VEGFA']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 May 28.,"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare, incurable hematologic disorder with a relatively indolent course in a majority of the patients. Despite this, a significant proportion of patients require treatment because of hypersecretion of immunoglobulin M and the invasion of bone marrow and peripheral organs by neoplastic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells. Historically, there has been a dearth of research and therapeutic advancements in the field of WM, with most understanding based on other, related B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recently, there has been an increase in dedicated work to better explain the pathobiology of WM, which has identified several clinical and genetic markers that serve to prognosticate disease course and patient outcomes. Furthermore, this has led to dedicated clinical trials and the development of novel drugs/regimens including the first Food and Drug Administration-approved agent for this diagnosis, ibrutinib. This review aims to document some of the recent advancements with respect to prognostic markers and therapeutic options for patients with WM, as well as certain selected novel treatments with unique mechanisms of action, that are currently under development.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Prognosis', 'Survival', 'Treatment', ""Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia""]",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" based on limited scientific evidence concerning childhood leukemia. This assessment emphasized the lack of appropriate animal models recapitulating the natural history of this disease. Childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the result of complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and exposure to exogenous agents. The most common chromosomal alteration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, which confers a low risk of developing the malignancy by originating a preleukemic clone requiring secondary hits for full-blown disease to appear. To develop potential prophylactic interventions, we need to identify the environmental triggers of the second hit. Recently, we generated a B-ALL mouse model of the human ETV6-RUNX1(+) preleukemic state. Here, we present the results from the ARIMMORA pilot study, obtained by exposing 34 Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mice (vs. 27 unexposed) to a 50 Hz magnetic field of 1.5 mT with both fundamental and harmonic content, with an on/off cycle of 10 min/5 min, for 20 h/day, from conception until 3 months of age. Mice were monitored until 2 years of age and peripheral blood was periodically analyzed by flow cytometry. One of the exposed mice developed B-ALL while none of the non-exposed did. Although the results are statistically non-significant due to the limited number of mice used in this pilot experiment, overall, the results show that the newly developed Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mouse can be successfully used for ELF-MF exposure studies about the etiology of childhood B-ALL.

However, the mechanism of STAG2 mutations promoting tumorigenesis is still unclear. Methods: The distribution of STAG2 mutations in cancer was determined through the COSMIC database; we also generated a STAG2 truncating mutation in OS cell line U2OS cells to mimic a common mutation in OS. CCK-8 assay was employed to evaluate the effect of STAG2 on proliferation and chemo-resistance in OS cells. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle assays were used to assess the effect of STAG2 on apoptosis and the cycle of OS cells. A high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) strategy using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform was applied to characterize the transcriptome profile from STAG2 knockout and STAG2 WT OS cell lines. Results: We found that STAG2 deficient-cells exhibited reduced cell proliferation and growth; however, they enhanced cell metastasis and invasion, and increased tolerance to chemotherapeutic drugs. We also found that PD-L1, a molecule involved in tumor immune evasion, was up-regulated in the SATG2-lost cells. Expression profile analysis by RNA-seq revealed that there were changes in the expression of many immune-related genes. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that STAG2 contributes to cell survival and chemo-resistance to cisplatin of OS, suggesting that deletion of STAG2 may promote tumorigenesis by enhancing the immune evasion capacity of cancer cells.",,PMC6511574,,['NOTNLM'],"['PD-L1', 'Stromal antigen 2 (STAG2)', 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeated (CRISPR)/Cas9', 'cohesin', 'immune evasion', 'osteosarcoma (OS)']",,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poor survival rate and lack of an effective targeted therapy for patients with MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemias emphasize an urgent need for improved knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches for these malignancies. The resulting chimeric products of MLL gene rearrangements, i.e., MLL-fusion proteins (MLL-FPs), are capable of transforming hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) into leukemic blasts. The ability of MLL-FPs to reprogram HSPCs toward leukemia requires the involvement of multiple chromatin effectors, including the histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase DOT1L, the chromatin epigenetic reader BRD4, and the super elongation complex. These epigenetic regulators constitute a complicated network that dictates maintenance of the leukemia program, and therefore represent an important cluster of therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we will discuss the role of MLL and its fusion partners in normal HSPCs and hematopoiesis, including the links between chromatin effectors, epigenetic landscapes, and leukemia development, and summarize current approaches to therapeutic targeting of MLL-r leukemias.","['K99 CA197498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA197498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA236626/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA233691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6529847,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL', 'MLL-rearranged', 'chromatin', 'epigenetics', 'leukemias']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In LE fundoscopy, the vitreous mass occupying most of the vitreous cavity and associated hemorrhage prevented retina visualization. B-scan ultrasound showed a multilobulated mass occupying virtually the entire vitreous cavity with associated choroidal detachment. Forty-eight hours later, she developed acute angle closure of LE with an IOP of 55 mmHg. A flow cytometric analysis of the anterior chamber and vitreous showed leukemic tumor cells.

However, only around 50% of patients respond to these agents, and responses tend to be transient, with loss of response frequently happening within 2 years and being associated with very poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Identification of patients who will respond to HMAs is challenging. Mechanisms underlying resistance to HMAs are not clear yet. Recently, absence of response has been associated with increased cell-cycle quiescence among the hematopoietic progenitor cells. There are no standard-of-care options for patients after HMA failure. However, the increasing knowledge of MDS pathogenesis has led to the development of new potential therapies, including HMAs with longer half-life and exposure, inhibition of the antiapoptotic BCL2 protein with venetoclax or inhibition of immune-checkpoint regulatory proteins such as PD-1 or CTLA-4, innate immunity and targeting of CD33/CD3 with multiple monoclonal antibodies. In addition, multiple targeted agents are opening opportunities to treat subgroups of patients whose disease harbors mutations in TP53, IDH, FLT3, and genes involved in splicing machinery. Newer formulations of intensive chemotherapy and its different combinations may be considered a valid option in selected patients after HMA failure. Finally, decision making at the time of failure of response to HMAs should be personalized, taking into account that allogenic stem-cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic approach with curative potential in these patients.

Present in every bodily tissue, stromal cells complement the functions of classical immune cells by sensing pathogens and tissue damage, coordinating leukocyte recruitment and function, and promoting immune response resolution and tissue repair. These diverse roles come with a price: like classical immune cells, inappropriate stromal cell behavior can lead to various forms of pathology, including inflammatory disease, tissue fibrosis, and cancer. An important immunological function of stromal cells is to act as information relays, responding to leukocyte-derived signals and instructing leukocyte behavior in kind. In this regard, several members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, including IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), have gained recognition as factors that mediate crosstalk between stromal and immune cells, with diverse roles in numerous inflammatory and homeostatic processes. This review summarizes our current understanding of how IL-6 family cytokines control stromal-immune crosstalk in health and disease, and how these interactions can be leveraged for clinical benefit.",,PMC6529849,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytokines', '*fibrosis', '*immune', '*inflammation', '*stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1-specific T cells are efficiently activated through dedicated human leukocyte antigen-mediated mechanisms, a process considered deeply involved with its pathogenesis. It has been reported that the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP differs between ethnic groups, and there is an association between HTLV-1 tax gene subgroups (i.e., tax subgroup-A or -B), which correspond to HTLV-1 ""cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroup A (i.e., transcontinental subgroup)"" and ""cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroup B (i.e., Japanese subgroup),"" respectively, and the risk of HAM/TSP in the Japanese population. These findings suggest that a given host's susceptibility to HAM/TSP is deeply connected with both differences in genetically determined components of the host immune response and HTLV-1 subgroup. Therefore, it is crucial for ongoing work to focus on developing novel treatments and preventative approaches for HAM/TSP. In this review, based on an overview of the topic and our latest research findings, the role of the HTLV-1 subgroup on the effects of virus-host interactions in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP is discussed.",,PMC6529560,,['NOTNLM'],"['HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'susceptibility', 'tax', 'virus subgroup']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to estimate the rate of HTLV infection and the geographical distribution of this virus in this state. Methods: All HTLV tests (chemiluminescence/ELISA assays/Western Blotting) performed in the Central Laboratory of Public Health of Bahia (LACEN) from 2004 to 2013 were included. Data was extracted from LACEN's database using high volume extract, transformation and load throughput. Infection rate was expressed as the number of infected individuals per 100,000 inhabitants considering municipalities grouped in microregions and/or mesoregions as the unit of analysis. Results: A total of 233,876 individuals were evaluated. Individuals were from 394 out of 417 municipalities of Bahia (94.5%). HTLV chemiluminescence/ELISA assay was found to be reactive for 3,138 individuals from whom 2,323 had WB results (1,978 positives, 62 negative and 282 indeterminate). Out of 1978 reactive samples, 1,813 (91.7%) were positive for HTLV-1, 58 (2.9%) for HTLV-2 and 107 (5.4%) were for both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. The cumulative mean rate of HTLV-positive cases in Bahia was 14.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Three microregions presented rates >20 HTLV-positive cases/100,000 inhabitants: Barreiras (24.83 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), Salvador (22.90 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and Ilheus-Itabuna (22.60 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Conclusion: HTLV infection is disseminated in the state of Bahia, with an overall moderate rate of infection.

Methods: Neurocognitive performances in 36 children and adolescents, aged 8.4-15.3 years, in long-term remission from ALL 4.3-12.4 years post diagnosis, without relapse, and with no pre-diagnosis history of neurodevelopmental disorder were compared with 36 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and parents' socio-economic status. The former patients and the healthy controls completed an extensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. Results: Survivors who were treated by CTO obtained significantly lower scores than did healthy controls on the domains of Copy and drawing (p = 0.001; Cohen's d 0.85; after controlling for Type 1 errors q = 0.006), Arithmetic (p = 0.001; Cohen's d 0.80; after controlling for Type 1 errors, q = 0.006), and Tactile sensory functions (p = 0.008; Cohen's d 0.65; after controlling for Type 1 errors, q = 0.03). Fifty percent of the ALL group were more than 1 SD below the control groups mean on Copy and drawing. There was an interaction between age and group (ALL vs. Control, p = 0.042) on Copy and drawing, indicating that the youngest ALL patients exhibited the worst performance. The oldest ALL patients performed equal to or better than the controls. A tendency in the same direction was seen for Arithmetic and Tactile sensory functions. The ALL survivors exhibited a steeper rising learning slope on repeated tests, with lower scores on a tactile problem-solving task, tactile sensory tests, verbal memory, and visual attention, but they performed as well as the controls when stimuli were repeated. Conclusion: The results indicate that neurocognitive long-term sequelae in ALL survivors are limited to specific domains - particularly complex drawing, arithmetic, and tactile processing, and novelty processing. Cognitive deficits are shown among the youngest ALL patients. Intervention programs and school programs should account for difficulties with processing new information and taking advantage of repetitions as a strength, which may prevent survivors from falling behind their peers.",,PMC6532365,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'compensating possibilities', 'long-term sequelae', 'neurocognitive', 'survivors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize post-chemotherapy sensory, memory, and attention abilities in childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to better understand how treatment affects cognitive functioning. Methods: Eight ALL survivors and eight age-matched, healthy children between the ages of 5-11 years participated in the study. Among the ALL survivors, a median of 63 days (range 22-267 days) elapsed between completion of chemotherapy and this assessment. Sounds were presented in an oddball paradigm while recording the electroencephalogram in separate conditions of passive listening and active task performance. To assess different domains of cognition, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reflecting sensory processing (P1 component), working memory (mismatch negativity [MMN] component), attentional orienting (P3a), and target detection (P3b component) in response to the sounds. We also measured sound discrimination and response speed performance. Results: Relative to control subjects, ALL survivors had poorer performance on auditory tasks, as well as decreased amplitude of the P1, MMN, P3a, and P3b components. ALL survivors also did not exhibit the amplitude gain typically observed in the sensory P1 component when attending to the sound input compared to when passively listening. Conclusions: Atypical responses were observed in brain processes associated with sensory discrimination, auditory working memory, and attentional control in pediatric ALL survivors indicating deficiencies in all cognitive domains compared to age-matched controls.

Epub 2019 Jun 2.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications. There is no evidence-based guideline on the use of routine prophylaxis in hematological malignancies except in patients with multiple myeloma. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of thrombosis and suggest a rationale for primary thromboprophylaxis in acute leukemia and lymphoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on newly-diagnosed acute leukemia and lymphoma patients who presented at our institution from November 2009 to March 2018. The study included a total of 157 patients with acute leukemia and 238 patients with lymphoma. The groups were analyzed to determine the incidence and risk factors of thromboembolic complications. RESULTS: The incidence of all thrombotic complications was 10.12% (40/395) including 11.4% (18/157) in patients with acute leukemia and 9.2% (22/238) in patients with lymphoma. The majority of events occurred in the first 6 months. Acute leukemia patients with thrombosis had a higher number of comorbidities than those without thrombosis (p < 0.05). Lymphoma patients with thrombotic complications had significantly higher beta-2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels compared to those without thrombosis (p < 0.05). Major bleeding events developed in five (3.1%) acute leukemia patients and two (0.8%) lymphoma patients. All the major bleeding events occurred when the patients were thrombocytopenic (platelet < 50,000/mm(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukemia patients with any comorbidity and lymphoma patients with higher lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2-microglobulin are at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. The prophylactic use of anticoagulant should be considered for those patients especially in the first 6 months.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Thrombosis', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'thromboprophylaxis']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9596-4042', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9386-7604', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-1861']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence has consistently supported a strong inflammatory and immune component for lymphoma aetiology. These studies have consistently implicated variation in the immune gene, human leucocyte antigen (HLA), to be associated with lymphoma risk. In this review, we summarize the historical and recent evidence of HLA in both lymphoma aetiology and survival. The recent momentum in uncovering HLA associations has been propelled by the conduct of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has permitted the evaluation of imputed HLA alleles in much larger sample sizes than historically feasible with allelotyping studies. Based on the culmination of smaller HLA typing studies and larger GWAS, we now recognize several HLA associations with Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and their subtypes. Although other genetic variants have also been implicated with lymphoma risk, it is notable that HLA associations have been reported in every NHL and HL subtype evaluated to date. Both HLA class I and class II alleles have been linked with NHL and HL risk. It is notable that the associations identified are largely specific to each lymphoma subtype. However, pleiotropic HLA associations have also been observed. For example, rs10484561, which is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*01:01 DQA1*01:01 DQB1*05:01, has been implicated in increased FL and DLBCL risk. Opposing HLA associations across subtypes have also been reported, such as for HLA-A*01:01 which is associated with increased risk of EBV-positive cHL but decreased risk of EBV-negative cHL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small cell lymphoma. Due to extensive linkage disequilibrium and allele/haplotypic variation across race/ethnicities, identification of causal alleles/haplotypes remains challenging. Follow-up functional studies are needed to identify the specific immunological pathways responsible in the multifactorial aetiology of HL and NHL. Correlative studies linking HLA alleles with known molecular subtypes and HLA expression in the tumours are also needed. Finally, additional association studies investigating HLA diversity and lymphoma survival are also required to replicate initial associations reported to date.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*epidemiology', '*immunology', '*lymphoma']",,['(c) 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to purify cytotoxins against human leukocytic cells from the culture supernatant of S. aureus by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography on a CM-cellulose column and HPLC on a Mono S 5/50 column. A major protein possessing cytotoxicity to HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was purified, and the protein was identified as alpha-hemolysin (Hla, alpha-toxin) based on its molecular weight (34 kDa) and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Flow cytometric analysis suggested differential cytotoxicity of Hla against different human peripheral blood leukocyte populations. After cell fractionation with density-gradient centrifugation, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were more susceptible to Hla than polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Moreover, cell surface marker analysis suggested that Hla exhibited slightly higher cytotoxicity against CD14-positive PBMCs (mainly monocytes) than CD3- or CD19-positive cells (T or B lymphocytes). From these results, we conclude that human leukocytes have different susceptibility to Hla depending on their cell lineages, and thereby the toxin may modulate the host immune response.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxin', 'flow cytometry', 'immune evasion', 'leukocyte', 'alpha-hemolysin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 26.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 genes result in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate and formation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which blocks normal cellular differentiation and promotes leukemogenesis. Nearly 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carry IDH1/2 mutations. Although multiple investigators have described the prognostic implications of IDH mutations in AML patients receiving chemotherapy, the effect of these mutations on outcomes after allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on the clinical outcome of a cohort of AML patients, who were tested for IDH mutations and underwent alloHCT at City of Hope (2015-2017). Of a total of 317 screened patients, 99 (31%) underwent alloHCT, of whom 23 carried and 76 did not carry IDH mutations (control). RESULTS: No statistical significance was detected in patient's overall survival (P = .84). With a median follow-up of 7.8 months, 1-year relapse rate of 29% and 13% was seen in the IDH-mutated and control group, respectively (P = .033). IDH1/2 mutation status remained significantly associated with relapse (hazard ratio, 2.8; P = .046) after inclusion of pre-HCT disease status in a multivariable model. CONCLUSION: Our results, despite low patient numbers, indicate that IDH mutations are associated with higher relapse rate after alloHCT.

Epub 2019 Jun 7.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies presented in patents show that a novel chemotherapeutic agent, venetoclax, might be useful in additional therapeutic indications. Venetoclax is approved in America for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Venetoclax selectively inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein, an anti-apoptotic protein that can be overexpressed in most B-cell lymphoid malignancies. AREAS COVERED: This is a review of all the patents granted until November 2018, with venetoclax in the examples or claim section of the patent document. The patents include the synthesis, polymorphism, formulations, in vitro and in vivo efficacy as well as the therapeutic application of venetoclax. EXPERT OPINION: The approved indications for treatment with venetoclax are limited but expanding rapidly. Studies suggest that venetoclax might be useful in several other therapeutic indications, mostly other hematological malignancies. Numerous studies use venetoclax in combinations with other therapeutic agents. Such combinational treatment shows promising results in additional indications as well as drug-resistant cancers. Venetoclax is an interesting new therapeutic involved in a variety of clinical research. Patent applications in recent years even include venetoclax in somewhat exotic fields such as type 1 diabetes, asthma, and Zika virus treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*bcl-2', '*bcl-2 inhibitor', '*cancer therapy', '*combinational therapy', '*venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrovirus genome is composed of the genes gag, pol, env, and a region known as pX. This region contains four open reading frames (ORFs) that encode specific proteins. The ORF-I produces the protein p12 and its cleavage product, p8. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of 32 ORF-I sequences from patients with different clinical profiles. Seven amino acid changes with frequency over 5% were identified: G29S, P34L, L55F, F61L, S63P, F78L, and S91P. The identification of regions where the posttranslational sites were identified showed a high identity among the sequences and the amino acid changes exclusive of specific clinical profile were found in less than 5% of the samples. We compare the findings with 2.406 sequences available in GenBank. The low overall genetic diversity found suggested that this region could be used in the HTLV-1 vaccine development.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*ORF-I', '*mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The levels of VEGF, LIF, IL-6 in serum, peritoneal fluid of patients with and without endometriosis were measured by ELISA. The mRNA of these three factors in the ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue and stromal cells were measured by real-time PCR. ESC derived from ovarian endometriomas were cultured using the method of primary cell culture with LIF and IL-6, and the level of VEGF mRNA and protein were measured by the method of real-time PCR and ELISA respectively. Results: VEGF and IL-6 concentration were 1.2 and 1.3 times higher in the serum of patients with endometriosis than in the control group [(94+/-19) versus (78+/-17) ng/L; (45+/-14) versus (35+/-9) ng/L; all P<0.05]. VEGF and IL-6 concentration were 1.2 and 1.4 times higher in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis than in the control group [(110+/-25) versus (91+/-21) ng/L; (69+/-20) versus (49+/-15) ng/L; all P<0.05]. VEGF and IL-6 concentrations in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis were 1.2 and 1.5 times higher than in serum (all P<0.01). VEGF, LIF and IL-6 mRNA expression were 2.2, 8.6, 44.7 times higher in ESC compared with the matching eutopic endometrial stromal cells (all P<0.01). LIF and IL-6 mRNA were 2.0 and 64.8 times higher in ectopic endometrial tissue than the matching eutopic endometrial tissue (all P<0.05).ESC cultured with LIF, IL-6 and LIF+IL-6 induce VEGF protein secretion [(106+/-18), (124+/-30), (140+/-27) ng/L] by 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 times (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Overexpression of LIF and IL-6 may synergistically contribute to upregulation of VEGF in ESC and promote development of endometriosis.","['2017YFC1001200/Special Foundation for Research on Reproductive Health and', 'Prevention and Control of Major Birth Defects']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Endometriosis', 'Endometrium', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Stromal cells', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor A']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we proposed a framework that will aid these departments in evaluating, benchmarking and ranking available multiclass classification models for the selection of the best one. Medical organisations have continuously faced evaluation and benchmarking challenges in such endeavour, especially when no single model is superior. Moreover, the improper selection of multiclass classification for acute leukaemia model may be costly for medical organisations. For example, when a patient dies, one such organisation will be legally or financially sued for incidents in which the model fails to fulfil its desired outcome. With regard to evaluation and benchmarking, multiclass classification models are challenging processes due to multiple evaluation and conflicting criteria. This study structured a decision matrix (DM) based on the crossover of 2 groups of multi-evaluation criteria and 22 multiclass classification models. The matrix was then evaluated with datasets comprising 72 samples of acute leukaemia, which include 5327 gens. Subsequently, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used in the benchmarking and ranking of multiclass classification models. The MCDM used techniques that include the integrated BWM and VIKOR. BWM has been applied for the weight calculations of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR has been used to benchmark and rank classification models. VIKOR has also been employed in two decision-making contexts: individual and group decision making and internal and external group aggregation. Results showed the following: (1) the integration of BWM and VIKOR is effective at solving the benchmarking/selection problems of multiclass classification models. (2) The ranks of classification models obtained from internal and external VIKOR group decision making were almost the same, and the best multiclass classification model based on the two was 'Bayes. Naive Byes Updateable' and the worst one was 'Trees.LMT'. (3) Among the scores of groups in the objective validation, significant differences were identified, which indicated that the ranking results of internal and external VIKOR group decision making were valid.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukaemia', 'BWM', 'Benchmarking', 'Classification', 'Multiclass evaluation', 'VIKOR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 830 patients (mean age at GCA diagnosis was 75.3 yrs, 74% women) diagnosed with biopsy-proven GCA between 1997 and 2010. Temporal artery biopsy results were retrieved from a regional database and reviewed to ascertain GCA diagnosis. The cohort was linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry. The patients were followed from GCA diagnosis until death or December 31, 2013. Incident malignancies registered after GCA diagnosis were studied. Based on data on the first malignancy in each organ system, age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% CI were calculated compared to the background population. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients (13%) were diagnosed with a total of 118 new malignancies after the onset of GCA. The overall risk for cancer after the GCA diagnosis was not increased (SIR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.17). However, there was an increased risk for myeloid leukemia (2.31, 95% CI 1.06-4.39) and a reduced risk for breast cancer (0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.72) and upper gastrointestinal tract cancer (0.16, 95% 0.004-0.91). Rates of other site-specific cancers were not different from expected. CONCLUSION: In this Swedish population-based cohort of GCA, the overall risk for cancer was not increased compared to the background population.

Epub 2019 May 30.,"Leukemia is a complex genetic disease caused by errors in differentiation, growth, and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in either lymphoid or myeloid lineages. Large-scale genomic characterization of thousands of leukemia patients has produced a tremendous amount of data that have enabled a better understanding of the differences between adult and pediatric patients. For instance, although phenotypically similar, pediatric and adult myeloid leukemia patients differ in their mutational profiles, typically involving either chromosomal translocations or recurrent single-base-pair mutations, respectively. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biology of this cancer, continual efforts have been made to develop more contextually and biologically relevant experimental models. Leukemic cell lines, for example, provide an inexpensive and tractable model but often fail to recapitulate critical aspects of tumor biology. Likewise, murine leukemia models of leukemia have been highly informative but also do not entirely reproduce the human disease. More recent advances in the development of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) or human models of leukemias are poised to provide a more comprehensive, and biologically relevant, approach to directly assess the impact of the in vivo environment on human samples. In this review, the advantages and limitations of the various current models used to functionally define the genetic requirements of leukemogenesis are discussed.",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Yet, data supporting the contribution of this family of genes to hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are limited. Here, we use publicly available genomic data to characterize the expression of the 33 aGPCRs in patients with AML and examine whether upregulation of these genes is associated with the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients. Upregulation in one or more of eight aGPCR genes (ADGRB1, ADGRC2, ADGRD1, ADGRE1, ADGRE2, ADGRE5, ADGRG1, and/or ADGRG3) was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (median OS: 11.8 vs 55.4 months; P < 0.0001). This was also significant in multivariate survival analysis (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.69; P = 0.015) after adjusting for age, molecular risk status, and transplant status. High expression of the eight aGPCRs was significantly associated with older age (>/=60; P = 0.011). Patients with high aGPCRs expression were more frequently classified in the poor molecular risk status group and less in the good risk status group compared with patients with low aGPCRs expression (31% vs 17% P = 0.049 and 14% vs 28% P =0.027, respectively). Via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified the interleukin-8 signaling pathway among the most activated pathways in patients with high aGPCRs expression. Overall, our data suggest that particular aGPCRs are frequently upregulated in AML and associated with poor clinical outcome. Future functional and mechanistic analyses are needed to address the role of aGPCRs in AML.",['UL1 TR001855/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7473775,['NIHMS1614839'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Expert recommendations have been produced by the 2017 European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL 7) after a review of the literature on the diagnosis and management of cytomegalovirus in patients after HSCT and in patients receiving other types of therapy for haematological malignancies. These recommendations cover diagnosis, preventive strategies such as prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy, and management of cytomegalovirus disease. Antiviral drugs including maribavir and letermovir are in development and prospective clinical trials have recently been completed. However, management of patients with resistant or refractory cytomegalovirus infection or cytomegalovirus disease is a challenge.

Both agents are generally well tolerated, and complications most commonly relate to myelosuppression. Antibiotic / antifungal use, regular monitoring, and proactive patient education are important to minimize these events, and reduce the need for dose delay. Responses to HMAs are often not evident for up to 6 cycles, and there is currently no validated clinical marker for predicting response. Hence, treatment should be continued for at least 4-6 cycles to ensure that patients have sufficient opportunity to respond. Delivery of insufficient numbers of cycles is a key reason for HMA failure, and premature discontinuation must be avoided. Genetic factors offer potential for better predicting responders to HMAs in future, but require further study.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Azacitidine', 'Decitabine', 'Hypomethylating agent']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein is essential for the formation of nuclear matrix-associated organelles named PML nuclear bodies (NBs) that act as a platform for post-translational modifications and protein degradation. PML NBs harbor transiently and permanently localized proteins and are associated with the regulation of several cellular functions including apoptosis. There are seven PML isoforms, six nuclear (PMLI-VI) and one cytoplasmic (PMLVII), which are encoded by a single gene via alternative RNA splicing. It has been reported that murine PML-null primary cells are resistant to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and that cytoplasmic PML is an essential activator of TGF-beta signaling. The role and the fate of interferon (IFN)-enhanced PML NBs in response to TGF-beta have not been investigated. Here we show that IFNalpha potentiated TGF-beta-mediated apoptosis in human cells. IFNalpha or ectopic expression of PMLIV, but not of PMLIII, enhanced TGF-beta-induced caspase 8 activation. In response to TGF-beta, both PMLIII and PMLIV were conjugated to SUMO and shifted from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear matrix, however only PMLIV, via its specific C-terminal region, interacted with caspase 8 and recruited it within PML NBs. This process was followed by a caspase-dependent PML degradation and PML NB disruption. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of PML NBs in the enhancement by IFN of TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and caspase 8 activation.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Caspase 8', '*Interferon', '*PML', '*SUMO', '*TGF-beta']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 19.,"BACKGROUND: Major advances in the treatment of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) have been made following the introduction of purine analogues. The major significant short-term toxicity of cladribine therapy are neutropenia and neutropenic fever (NF) which may be life-threatening. AIM: In this retrospective study, we compared the incidence and duration of neutropenia and hospitalization in patients with HCL treated with cladribine followed by peg-filgrastim as primary prophylaxis versus daily filgrastim given ""on demand"" according to absolute neutrophil count (ANC). METHODS: Medical records of patients with HCL diagnosed and followed in 12 medical centers in Israel during 1985-2015 were examined for details of disease at diagnosis. The efficacy of peg-filgrastim and filgrastim was assessed by evaluating the incidence of neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x 10 [9]/L), number and length of hospitalizations, and number of days from the last day of therapy to recovery of ANC to >1.0 x 10 [9]/L. RESULTS: The study population included 202 patients with HCL, 159 of whom (80.7%) were treated with cladribine; 78 patients (49%) required hospitalization for the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics due to NF. Twenty-eight (19%) patients were treated with peg-filgrastim as primary prophylaxis, while 74 (64%) received filgrastim ""on demand"" due to neutropenia. Median length of hospitalization, and nadir duration were 8 and 18 days respectively (p = 0.71, p = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Infectious complications post-cladribine treatment remain high. No difference was found in terms of incidence of NF, number of febrile days, and nadir duration in patients receiving primary peg-filgrastim prophylaxis compared to filgrastim given on demand. Both approaches are justifiable, and the choice remains at the physician's discretion.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*G-CSF', '*HCL', '*Hairy cell leukemia', '*Nadir', '*Neutropenia', '*Neutropenic fever']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 20.,"It is widely accepted that aluminium is neurotoxic; it primarily causes cognitive dysfunction, which has been confirmed in human and animal tissue and cell experiments (Bondy, 2010), but its toxic mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that may be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors and is independent from changes in the underlying DNA sequence, resulting in a change in phenotype without a change in genotype, which in turn affects how cells read genes. Some findings emphasize the potential significance of histone lysine methylation for orderly brain development and as a molecular toolbox to study chromatin function in vivo and in vitro. The H3K4-specific methyltransferase MLL is essential for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and might be involved in cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, we established that chronic aluminium exposure results in cognitive dysfunction, causing deficits in exploratory behaviour and learning and memory, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that chronic aluminium exposure reduces expression of histone H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and the activity and expression of MLL. Taken together, these results indicate that chronic aluminium exposure may reduce H3K4me3 levels through suppressing activation of MLL, which in turn affects cognitive ability.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic aluminium exposure', 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'H3K4me3', 'MLL']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs in a sequence specific manner, thereby determining their degradation or inhibiting translation. They are involved in processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by fine-tuning the expression of genes underlying such events. The expression of specific miRNAs is involved in hematopoietic differentiation and their deregulation contributes to the development of hematopoietic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). miR-130a is over-expressed in AML. Here we show that miR-130a is physiologically expressed in myeloblasts and down-regulated during monocyte differentiation. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed on CD34(+)human hematopoietic stem cells confirmed that expression of miR-130a inhibits monocyte differentiation by interfering with the expression of key transcription factors HOXA10, IRF8, KLF4, MAFB and PU-1. The data obtained in this study highlight that the correct modulation of miR-130a is necessary for normal differentiation to occur and confirming that deregulation of this miRNA might underlie the differentiation block occurring in AML.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Differentiation', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Monocyte', '*Stem cell', '*Transcription factor', '*microRNA']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Cord blood confers the advantages of rapid availability and higher tolerance to two HLA antigen mismatches compared with unrelated donors, and this has increased opportunities for patients who do not have suitable donors or require urgent transplantation. Although the higher rate of engraftment failure remains a serious concern after cord blood transplantation (CBT), the mechanisms underlying this risk have gradually been clarified, which has helped to improve engraftment. Recent studies of CBT and other alternatives have reported comparable outcomes.

We report a case of ATLL that was treated with sequential mogamulizumab (MOG) and lenalidomide (LEN) for early relapse after allo-HSCT. A 73-year-old Japanese male with acute-type ATLL underwent haploidentical-HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. He attained a complete response. However, ATLL relapse was diagnosed by biopsy of skin lesions that appeared on day 67. Discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy alone did not result in improvement of ATLL, however, the skin lesions disappeared after an immune response was induced by sequential MOG and LEN. Following MOG and LEN, very serious toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) developed requiring high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Although graft-versus-host disease exacerbated and progressed to TEN, a complete response was achieved after successful treatment of TEN. These agents may thus enhance anti-ATLL activity by immune modulation. Further investigation is necessary to determine the optimal use of MOG and LEN in relapsed ATLL after allo-HSCT.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Haploidentical stem cell transplantation', 'Lenalidomide', 'Mogamulizumab', 'Toxic epidermal necrolysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of alternative donors for AML in CR1. We analyzed 1561 patients who underwent HCT from an HLA-matched related donor (MRD), HLA 8/8-matched unrelated donor (MUD), or umbilical cord blood (UCB). The results of a multivariate analysis showed that HCT from UCB (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.52), age >/=50 years (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14-1.62), male (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.66), PS > 1 (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17-2.42), and poor-risk cytogenetics (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.29-1.81) had an inferior prognostic impact on OS. We conclude that an MUD is the best alternative to an HLA identical MRD for patients with AML in CR1. UCB is an alternative option if neither MRD nor MUD are available, or when patients need to receive urgent HCT for poor-risk AML in CR1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"PURPOSE: The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat potentiates anthracycline and cytarabine cytotoxicity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We hypothesized that panobinostat prior to and during induction chemotherapy would be tolerable and augment response in patients showing increased histone acetylation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received panobinostat 20-60 mg oral daily on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 with daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2)/day intravenously on days 3 to 5 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2)/day intravenously by continuous infusion on days 3 to 9 (""7+3""). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for HDAC expression and histone acetylation changes. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients ages 60-85 years (median age, 69) were treated. Fifteen patients had de novo AML, six AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, two AML with prior myeloproliferative neoplasm, one therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, and one myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred in dose escalation cohorts. In dose expansion, six patients received panobinostat at 60 mg and nine patients at 50 mg due to recurrent grade 1 bradycardia at the 60-mg dose. The complete response (CR)/incomplete count recovery (Cri) rate was 32%. Median overall survival was 10 months: 23 months with CR/CRi versus 7.8 months without CR/CRi (log-rank P = 0.02). Median relapse-free survival was 8.2 months. Increased histone acetylation 4 and 24 hours after panobinostat was significantly associated with CR/CRi.

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a recessive disorder typified by bone marrow failure and predisposition to hematological malignancies. SDS is predominantly caused by deficiency of the allosteric regulator Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome that cooperates with elongation factor-like GTPase 1 (EFL1) to catalyze release of the ribosome antiassociation factor eIF6 and activate translation. Here, we report biallelic mutations in EFL1 in 3 unrelated individuals with clinical features of SDS. Cellular defects in these individuals include impaired ribosomal subunit joining and attenuated global protein translation as a consequence of defective eIF6 eviction. In mice, Efl1 deficiency recapitulates key aspects of the SDS phenotype. By identifying biallelic EFL1 mutations in SDS, we define this leukemia predisposition disorder as a ribosomopathy that is caused by corruption of a fundamental, conserved mechanism, which licenses entry of the large ribosomal subunit into translation.","['MC_UP_A390_1106 /MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '1330931/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/L003368/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105161083 /MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC6754720,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6127-7116', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8415-6771', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9277-4553', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0758-8022']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) occurs in 2 major forms: aggressive and indolent. Low miR-29b expression in aggressive CLL is associated with poor prognosis. Indiscriminate miR-29b overexpression in the B-lineage of mice causes aberrance, thus warranting the need for selective introduction of miR-29b into B-CLL cells for therapeutic benefit. The oncofetal antigen receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is expressed on malignant B-CLL cells, but not normal B cells, encouraging us with ROR1-targeted delivery for therapeutic miRs. Here, we describe targeted delivery of miR-29b to ROR1(+) CLL cells leading to downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A, modulation of global DNA methylation, decreased SP1, and increased p21 expression in cell lines and primary CLL cells in vitro. Furthermore, using an Emu-TCL1 mouse model expressing human ROR1, we report the therapeutic benefit of enhanced survival via cellular reprograming by downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in vivo. Gene expression profiling of engrafted murine leukemia identified reprogramming of cell cycle regulators with decreased SP1 and increased p21 expression after targeted miR-29b treatment. This finding was confirmed by protein modulation, leading to cell cycle arrest and survival benefit in vivo. Importantly, SP1 knockdown results in p21-dependent compensation of the miR-29b effect on cell cycle arrest. These studies form a basis for leukemic cell-targeted delivery of miR-29b as a promising therapeutic approach for CLL and other ROR1(+) B-cell malignancies.","['R01 CA197844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F99 CA245813/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6676131,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0275-9673', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5378-3315', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2326-7133', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9955-3454']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both studies were based on the use of methodological reviewers and reporting guidelines (RG). Those interventions slightly improved the items reported on the Manuscript Quality Assessment Instrument (MQAI), which assesses the quality of the research report. However, masked evaluators were able to guess the allocated group in 62% (56/90) of the papers, thus presenting a risk of detection bias. In this post-hoc study, we analyse whether those interventions that were originally designed for improving the completeness of manuscript reporting may have had an effect on the number of citations, which is the measured outcome that we used. METHODS: Masked to the intervention group, one of us used the Web of Science (WoS) to quantify the number of citations that the participating manuscripts received up December 2016. We calculated the mean citation ratio between intervention arms and then quantified the uncertainty of it by means of the Jackknife method, which avoids assumptions about the distribution shape. RESULTS: Our study included 191 articles (99 and 92, respectively) from the two previous studies, which all together received 1336 citations. In both studies, the groups subjected to additional processes showed higher averages, standard deviations and annual rates. The intervention effect was similar in both studies, with a combined estimate of a 43% (95% CI: 3 to 98%) increase in the number of citations. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret that those effects are driven mainly by introducing into the editorial process a senior methodologist to find missing RG items. Those results are promising, but not definitive due to the exploratory nature of the study and some important caveats such as: the limitations of using the number of citations as a measure of scientific impact; and the fact that our study is based on a single journal. We invite journals to perform their own studies to ascertain whether or not scientific repercussion is increased by adhering to reporting guidelines and further involving statisticians in the editorial process.",,PMC6544961,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Number of citations', '*Peer-review', '*Reporting guidelines', '*Reproducibility', '*Transparency']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5692-0891'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 17.,"Multidrug resistance is considered as a major obstacle for effective tumour chemotherapy. With the ability to deliver drugs into tumour cells, microparticles may act as a drug delivery vehicle to overcome drug resistance. In the present study, we developed an approach employing daunorubicin-loaded microparticles to surmount the drug resistance in leukaemia. The microparticles, derived from the drug-sensitive cells K562 and the drug-resistant cells K562/ADR, composed of cellular material, can effectively package drugs using intracellular and extracellular drug-loading method, respectively. The results demonstrated that the microparticles significantly improved the drug anti-tumour effect, which was influenced by the preparation methods and the source of donor cells.

Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are critical for controlling virus infections. Here, we identified 897 type I ISGs induced by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by RNA-Seq. In addition, we further identified 152 potential anti-ALV-J chicken type I ISGs. Among these potential anti-ALV-J ISGs, chicken cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (chCH25H) was selected for further antiviral mechanism studies in chicken embryo fibroblast cell lines (DF1). The gene chCH25H is located on chromosome 6 and clustered in a distinct group with mammals CH25H in the phylogenetic tree. The core promoter region of chCH25H was located within -75/-1 sequence. We found that chCH25H was induced by chicken IFN-alpha and ALV-J in DF1 cells. The overexpression of chCH25H significantly inhibited ALV-J replication in DF1 cells at 48 h post infection (hpi). In addition, ALV-J replication was significantly enhanced in the chCH25H- knockout DF1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chCH25H restricted ALV-J infection through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), rather than type I and II interferon. Our results identified 152 potential anti-ALV-J chicken type I ISGs and revealed that 25HC, the product of chCH25H, could be used as a natural antiviral agent to control ALV-J infection.",,PMC6631237,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALV-J', '*CH25H', '*ISG', '*chicken']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7940-1303'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to organ involvement, CMV reactivation can exert indirect effects such as immunosuppression or graft failure that may result in the development of concurrent infectious complications. Currently, preemptive therapy, which is based on PCR-based monitoring of CMV from blood, is a mainstay enabling improvement in CMV-related outcomes. During the past decades, new antiviral drugs, clinical trials for prophylaxis in high-risk groups, and vaccines for preventing CMV infection have been introduced.

Epub 2019 May 24.,"PURPOSE: Luminal gastrointestinal tract cancers (LGC) are common malignancies, and many patients can achieve long-term responses with surgery, cytotoxic and/or targeted therapies, and radiation. The long-term follow-up for patients with durable disease control has not been fully characterized, including subsequent malignancies. Such cases have not been comprehensively described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients evaluated for myeloid malignancies (MyM) who had a prior LGC at our institution over a 35-year period. Patient, disease, and treatment information was collected for analysis. Cytogenetic risk profiles were designated according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS and the European LeukemiaNet Guidelines for AML. RESULTS: 66 patients were included in our cohort with 71 prior LGC diagnoses, including three patients with multiple LGCs. 31 cases were treated with surgery alone, and 37 patients received chemotherapy. The median age at diagnosis of MyM was 71.8 years (range, 36.2-90.5), with median duration between initiation of treatment of LGC and diagnosis MyM of 7.9 years (range 0.005-38.8). Intermediate or adverse (AML)/poor-very poor (MDS) cytogenetic risk was common, occurring in 43% of MDS patients and 100% of AML patients; deletion 5q was the most common cytogenetic abnormality overall. DNMT3A mutations were the most common molecular alteration (6 patients with 7 mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MyM following LGC, a high proportion harbored cytogenetic changes, many of which were adverse or poor-risk. Deletion 5q and mutated DNMT3A were the most common abnormalities identified.",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7051794,['NIHMS1069547'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytogenetics', '*Molecular alterations', '*Survivorship', '*Treatment-related neoplasms']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Given that survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications and obesity, we sought to characterize BMI trends from diagnosis through early survivorship in a multi-ethnic, contemporary cohort of childhood ALL patients and determine if early weight change was predictive of long-term weight status. METHODS: The study population consisted of ALL patients aged 2-15 years at diagnosis who were treated with chemotherapy alone at Texas Children's Hospital. Each patient had BMI z-scores collected at diagnosis, 30-days post-diagnosis, and annually for five years. Linear regression models were estimated to evaluate the association between: 1) BMI z-score change in the first 30 days and BMI z-scores at five-years post-diagnosis; and 2) BMI z-score change in the first year post-diagnosis and BMI z-scores at five-years post-diagnosis. RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included longitudinal data from 121 eligible patients. The mean BMI z-scores for the population increased significantly (p-value<0.001) from baseline (mean = 0.25) to 30 days post-diagnosis (mean = 1.17) before plateauing after one year post-diagnosis (mean = 0.99). Baseline BMI z-scores were statistically significant predictors to five year BMI z-scores (p <0.001). Independent of baseline BMI z-score and other clinical factors, the BMI z-score at one year post-diagnosis was significantly associated with BMI z-score at five-years post-diagnosis (beta = 0.63, p <0.001), while BMI z-score at 30 days post-diagnosis was not (beta = 0.10, p = 0.23). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that weight gain within the first year after diagnosis is more strongly associated with long-term BMI than early weight gain (within 30 days). If confirmed, this information may help identify a window of time during therapy when ALL patients would benefit most from weight management directed interventions.",['K07 CA218362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6544325,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7618-7009', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0978-5863']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the treatment options for late-stage cancer patients have continued to increase in numbers, the overall survival rates for these patients have not shown significant improvement. This highlights the need for new targets and drugs to more effectively treat lung cancer patients. In this study, we characterize the MCL-1 inhibitor maritoclax alone or in combination with a BCL-2/xL inhibitor in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. BCL-2 family proteins, phosphorylated proteins, and apoptosis were monitored following the treatments. We found that maritoclax was effective at inhibiting growth in these lung cancer cells. We also establish that cell lines with EGFR mutations were most sensitive to the combined inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL. In addition, a high level of phosphorylated AKT (S473) was identified as a marker for sensitivity to the combination treatment.

Methods: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design. The study was conducted at a hospital in Seoul, Korea. The target population of this study was 72 adolescents and young adults (AYA) who received follow-up visit for leukemia. Participants completed measures of their resilience, illness cognition (i.e., helplessness, acceptance, and perceived benefits), and QOL. The correlation between the study variables was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, while the impacts on resilience and QOL were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Acceptance, which is a subcategory of illness cognition, was associated with resilience and QOL of AYA leukemia survivors. After acceptance was included in model 2 using the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, the increased explanatory powers of resilience and QOL were 23% and 33%, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that acceptance, which is a subcategory of illness cognition, may be an important factor for resilience and QOL in AYA leukemia survivors.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acceptance', '*adolescents', '*illness cognition', '*leukemia', '*quality of life', '*resilience']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"BACKGROUND: The combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has proven to be the most effective therapy for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The majority of the morbidity and mortality from APL therapy occur during the induction phase. The objective of the current study was to identify the risk factors associated with transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and endotracheal intubation during induction therapy in patients with APL. METHODS: The authors analyzed the clinical characteristics of 187 patients with newly diagnosed APL who were treated with ATRA and ATO with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The authors documented the percentage change in body weight from baseline to the maximum recorded weight during induction or to the day of ICU transfer. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients (10%) who initiated therapy with ATRA and ATO on a regular hospital floor required transfer to the ICU after a median of 12 days of induction therapy. The median volume of transfusions was 4350 mL (range, 60-30,750 mL). The volume of transfusions was the main factor associated with the risk of ICU transfer (odds ratio, 4.1; P < .001). Of the 18 patients transferred to the ICU, 10 patients (5%) required intubation. An increase in the total volume of transfusions, increase in weight >/=10% during induction therapy, and a plasma albumin level </=3.2 g/dL at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with an increased risk of endotracheal intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Large volumes of blood product transfusions and unrecognized fluid overload during induction are associated with ICU transfer and endotracheal intubation in patients with APL. These can be prevented by limiting the amount of transfusions, careful monitoring for subtle signs of fluid overload, and early intervention with aggressive diuretic therapy.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)', '*early death', '*fluid overload', '*intensive care unit (ICU) transfer']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9375-9598', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5511-6153', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9003-0390']",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cord blood transplantation (UCBT) and non-T-cell-depleted stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donors (HAPLO) are both strategies that have shown encouraging results in patients who do not have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or unrelated donor. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 409 adults with sAML receiving either UCBT (n = 163) or HAPLO (n = 246) in EBMT centers. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) was the antecedent diagnosis in 79% of UCBT and 85% of HAPLO recipients. In multivariate analysis, UCBT was associated with higher risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (HR 1.9, p = 0.009) and lower GHVD-free-relapse-free-survival (GRFS) (HR 1.57, p = 0.007) compared to HAPLO. Chronic-GVHD, RI, NRM, LFS, and OS were not statistically different between the two. Early disease stage at transplant was independently associated with lower RI and NRM and higher OS and LFS. These results indicate that HAPLO is associated with better GRFS and lower aGvHD compared to UCBT in patients with sAML and that UCBT can be a valid alternative for sAML patients who lack a matched sibling, a proper haploidentical or an unrelated donor.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3304-9965', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2767-8191', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6006-8088']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 8.,"Introduction: Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a significant cause for morbidity and mortality in children receiving chemotherapy or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). As compared to adults, children may differ from adults in specific aspects regarding epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IFD. Areas covered: The review provides an overview over the epidemiology of IFD in children with cancer or undergoing HSCT, diagnostic tools, preventive and therapeutic strategies. Expert opinion: Whereas the risk for IFD is highest in children with acute myeloid leukemia, relapse of acute leukemia, and allogeneic HSCT, the individual risk for IFD needs to be better defined in the large and heterogenous group of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In contrast to galactomannan, pediatric data on beta-D-glucan and PCR testing are scarce. Findings of imaging studies in children are often not typical, but may prompt invasive diagnostic procedures. No substantial differences exist between children and adult regarding antifungal chemoprophylaxis, empirical, pre-emptive and specific therapy. However, antifungal strategies in children are limited as a number of antifungal compounds are not licensed for children or their pediatric dosage is unknown.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antifungal prophylaxis', '*Aspergillus', '*cancer', '*child', '*empirical antifungal therapy', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*invasive mold infection', '*pre-emptive antifungal therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease associated with various genetic abnormalities. Somatic mutations in nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) are the most frequent mutations associated with AML. However, because DNMT3A mutations are broadly distributed, they are challenging to analyze in routine laboratory tests. Hence, we developed a rapid screening method for DNMT3A mutations by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for clinical use at the point of AML diagnosis. METHODS: The detection limit for DNMT3A mutations from exons 8-23 by an HRM analysis was investigated using plasmid mixtures. In 69 patients with AML, somatic mutations in NPM1, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), DNMT3A, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 were screened using HRM analysis, and direct sequencing was performed for positive samples. RESULTS: High-resolution melting analysis enabled complete mutation detection in samples with 20% mutant alleles in all regions. In a clinical laboratory test, DNMT3A mutations were detected in 12 cases (17.3%), and we identified five novel mutations. Simultaneous NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and DNMT3A mutations constituted the most common pattern (30%) in de novo cytogenetically normal AML. CONCLUSION: High-resolution melting analysis has sufficient performance for the detection of DNMT3A mutations in AML. This approach can facilitate rapid AML genotyping at diagnosis in clinical settings.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT3A', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical laboratory test', 'genotyping', 'high-resolution melting analysis']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2688-8522'],['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The global prevalence is 30% in humans, but varies by locality (e.g. in the UK it is typically 10%). The association between lung cancer and T. gondii infection was investigated by direct detection in lung tissue samples. Methods: Lung tissue samples were taken from patients undergoing lung resection surgery (n=72) for suspected lung cancer (infection prevalence 100% (95% CI: 93.9-100%)). All 72 participants were confirmed as having lung cancer following subsequent diagnostic tests. In addition, bronchial biopsy samples were collected from non-lung cancer healthy control subjects (n=10). Samples were tested for T. gondii using PCR amplification of T. gondii specific gene markers and T. gondii specific immunohistochemistry. Results: All 72 lung cancer patients were infected with T. gondii (prevalence 100% (95% CI: 93.9-100%)). Of which, 95.8% (n=69) of patients showed evidence of active parasite stages. Infection prevalence in the controls (10%) was significantly lower (p<0.0001).

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is a form of cellular immunotherapy which is known to be effective in preventing relapse in leukemia by inducing graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for benign hematological conditions including primary immune deficiency, mixed chimerism is seen with the use of reduced intensity conditioning. DLI can help prevent graft rejection by boosting the existing graft in these situations. There is scant data on the use of DLI in children who have undergone HSCT for benign hematological disorders. We present our case series with early withdrawal of immunosuppression and DLI as a means to mitigate relapse of leukemia and prevent graft rejection in mixed chimerism in children transplanted for benign hematological disorders. Donor lymphocyte infusion was given in a graded regimen with the cell dose of 1 x 10(5) CD3 cells/kg (1 x 10(4)/kg in haploidentical transplant), 5 x 10(5) CD3 cells/kg, 1 x 10(6) CD3 cells/kg depending on the graft kinetics and the clinical status of the children. A total of fifty eight children including those with haploidentical donors underwent DLI with an overall survival of 81.1%. The use of fresh whole blood in very small aliquots from the donor has made this technique cost effective and an attractive form of immunotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Multiple myeloma is the second most frequent hematological cancer after lymphoma and remains an incurable disease. The pervasive support provided by the bone marrow microenvironment to myeloma cells is crucial for their survival. Here, an unbiased assessment of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed in myeloma identified ROR2, a receptor for the WNT noncanonical pathway, as highly expressed in myeloma cells. Its ligand, WNT5A is the most abundant growth factor in the bone marrow of myeloma patients. ROR2 mediates myeloma cells interactions with the surrounding bone marrow and its depletion resulted in detachment of myeloma cells from their niche in an in vivo model, triggering apoptosis and thus markedly delaying disease progression. Using in vitro and ex vivo 3D-culture systems, ROR2 was shown to exert a pivotal role in the adhesion of cancer cells to the microenvironment. Genomic studies revealed that the pathways mostly deregulated by ROR2 overexpression were PI3K/AKT and mTOR. Treatment of cells with specific PI3K inhibitors already used in the clinic reduced myeloma cell adhesion to the bone marrow. Together, our findings support the view that ROR2 and its downstream targets represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the large subgroup of MM patients whose cancer cells show ROR2 overexpression.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2791-3638', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2973-5038']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manufacturers are required to ensure the safety of such products by validating the clearance of viruses in downstream purification steps. Cation exchange (CEX) chromatography is widely used in bind/elute mode as a polishing step in mAb purification. However, bind/elute modes require a large volume of expensive resin. To reduce the production cost, the use of CEX chromatography in overloaded mode has recently been investigated. The viral clearance ability in overloaded mode was evaluated using murine leukemia virus (MLV). Even under high-load conditions such as 2,000 g mAb/L resin, MLV was removed from mAb solutions. This viral clearance ability was not significantly affected by resin type or mAb type. The overloaded mode can also remove other types of viruses such as pseudorabies virus and reovirus Type 3 from mAb solutions. Based on these results, this cost-effective overloaded mode is comparable to the bind-elute mode in terms of viral removal.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cation exchange chromatography', '*monoclonal antibody', '*overloaded mode', '*purification', '*viral clearance']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5548-7520'],['(c) 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 17.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated NPM1 is a newly recognized separate entity in the revised 2016 WHO classification, and is associated with a favorable prognosis. While previous studies have evaluated NPM1 in a binary fashion, we recently demonstrated a significant independent negative prognostic effect of high NPM1 mutant allele burden (VAF) at diagnosis in a cohort of de novo AML patients. Although the importance of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in NPM1-mutated AML has been well characterized, the potential relationship between diagnostic allele burden and MRD is unknown. We retrospectively evaluated for MRD at first remission (CR1). We used either next-generation sequencing (NGS) [n = 71], and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) [n = 60], in a subset of patients from our recently examined cohort. We identified a statistically significant positive correlation between the VAF at diagnosis, and at CR1 (Spearman r = 0.4, P = .006), and enrichment for MRD in high diagnostic VAF patients (P = .05), as previously defined. IHC-positivity also correlated significantly with a higher median diagnostic NPM1 VAF (0.42 vs 0.39, P = .02), and with the VAF at CR1 (Spearman r = 0.7, P = .003). In multivariable analyses, both high diagnostic VAF (P = .003) and MRD (P = .02) were independent predictors of shorter event-free survival (EFS). Our findings suggest a relationship between the NPM1 mutant allele burden at diagnosis, and the presence of MRD at first remission. Our findings support IHC as a potentially useful adjunctive tool for disease monitoring.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7813-4573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4250-3891']","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Splicing of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA, carried out by the spliceosome, represents a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression. Mutations and other deregulation in some of the spliceosome components have been identified in multiple pathologies, including hematological malignancies. In this context, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of a splicing inhibitor, Pladienolide B (Pla-B), in two erythroleukemia cell lines. HEL and K562 cell lines were incubated with increasing doses of Pla-B in single and daily administration. Cell viability and density were evaluated using trypan blue assay. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate cell death, cell cycle, and caspase activity. NGS analysis was performed to assess the mutational status of 4 splicing-related genes (SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2 and SRSF2). Expression levels of SF3B1 and unspliced DNAJB1 were evaluated by qPCR. Pla-B significantly decreased the viability and proliferation of both cell lines in time, dose, administration schedule, and cell line-dependent manner. HEL cells were more sensible to Pla-B (IC50 = 1.5 nM) than K562 (IC50 = 25 nM), with an IC50 almost 17 times lower. Pla-B induced cell death, mainly by apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. No mutations were found in any of the analyzed genes, suggesting that the observed cytotoxic effect is independent of the spliceosome mutations. Splicing modulator Pla-B showed high antitumor activity against HEL and K562 cell lines, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These data suggest that Pla-B might represent a new therapeutic approach for erythroleukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Erythroleukemia', '*Pladienolide B', '*SF3B1', '*Splicing inhibitor']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1470-4802'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 30.,"A multicenter retrospective study was performed to explore a prognostic scoring index in order to identify a population who are least likely to benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The cohort included 519 patients with AML, who received HCT between 2005 and 2015 at a status of relapse or primary induction failure. Multivariate analysis demonstrated five independent predictors for OS, including C-reactive protein >/= 1 mg/dL, peripheral blood blast fraction >/= 20%, poor-risk karyotype, performance status >/= 2, and bone marrow unrelated donor as a stem cell source. A prognostic scoring index was explored based on these predictors, and successfully separated the cohort into four groups. At 2 years, OS was 47%, 24%, 8%, and 0% for Good (Score 0, 1: n = 118), Intermediate-1 (Score 2: n = 75), Intermediate-2 (Score 3: n = 39), and Poor (Score 4: n = 24), respectively (P < 0.001). The predicting value of the index was confirmed in a validation cohort. Although a further validation study is warranted, the scoring index may be useful to predict survival and to identify the population with the lowest survival prior to HCT in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6704-3633', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5163-0163']",,,,,,"['Kanto Study', 'Group for Cell Therapy (KSGCT)']",,,,,,,,,,,

epigenetically silenced and acted as a tumor suppressor gene in diverse human solid tumors. Conversely, recent studies show that miR-335 overexpression was identified in both adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that it might play an oncogenic role of miR-335 in AML. However, the role of miR-335 during leukemogenesis remains to be elucidated. MiR-335/ID4 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and/or western blot. Survival analysis was performed to explore the association between miR-335/ID4 expression and the prognosis, and further validated by public databases. Gain-of-function experiments determined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were conducted to investigate the biological functions of miR-335/ID4. Herein, we found that miR-335 expression, independent of its methylation, was significantly increased and negatively correlated with reduced ID4 expression in AML. Moreover, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression independently affected chemotherapy response and leukemia-free/overall survival in patients with AML. Gain-of-function experiments in vitro showed the oncogenic role of miR-335 by affecting cell apoptosis and proliferation in AML, and could be rescued by ID4 restoration. Mechanistically, we identified and verified that miR-335/ID4 contributed to leukemogenesis through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression was an independent prognostic biomarker in AML.

Red cells in HS are characterized by membrane instability and reduced deformability and there is marked heterogeneity in disease severity among patients. To unravel this variability in disease severity, we analyzed blood samples from 21 HS patients with defects in ankyrin, band 3, alpha-spectrin or beta-spectrin using red cell indices, eosin-5-maleimide binding, microscopy, the osmotic fragility test, Percoll density gradients, vesiculation and ektacytometry to assess cell membrane stability, cellular density and deformability. Reticulocyte counts, CD71 abundance, band 4.1 a:b ratio, and glycated hemoglobin were used as markers of RBC turnover. We observed that patients with moderate/severe spherocytosis have short-living erythrocytes of low density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity. These cells show a prominent decrease in membrane stability and deformability and, as a consequence, are quickly removed from the circulation by the spleen. In contrast, in mild spherocytosis less pronounced reduction in deformability results in prolonged RBC lifespan and, hence, cells are subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild spherocytosis thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen. Based on our findings, we conclude that RBC membrane loss, cellular heterogeneity and density are strong markers of clinical severity in spherocytosis.",,PMC7012482,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 298 family caregivers (FCs) of leukemia patients from three major cancer centers in the capital city of Heilongjiang province of China. Their dimensional scores of the EQ-5D-5 L were compared with those of the WHOQOL-BREF to test the convergent validity (constructs measuring the same concept) and divergent validity (constructs measuring different concepts) of the EQ-5D-5 L. Repeated surveys were conducted on 271 participants to determine the test-retest reliability of the EQ-5D-5 L. RESULTS: The four physical dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort) of the EQ-5D-5 L had moderate or high correlations with the physical health domain of the WHOQOL-BREF, with a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.459 to 0.559. The anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-5 L had a high correlation (r = 0.667) with the psychological domain of the WHOQOL-BREF. By contrast, lower but still significant physical-to-psychological correlations were found between the two instruments (r ranging from 0.219 to 0.396). In addition, the EQ-5D-5 L dimensional scores showed no or weak correlations with the environment and social domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (r ranging from 0.016 to 0.207). High test-retest reliability (> 0.7) was evident. CONCLUSION: The Chinese version of the EQ-5D-5 L has satisfactory reliability and validity in FCs of leukemia patients. It can be used to elicit utility of health-related quality of life in FCs of leukemia.","['71503062/Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of', ""the People's Republic of China (CN)"", '2017M611402/China Postdoctoral Fund', '2017RWZX08/the HMU Innovation Fund', 'LBH-Z16137/Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation', 'LBH-Z16240/Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Fund', 'CMB-19-308/China Medical Board Open Competition Grant']",PMC6543556,,['NOTNLM'],"['EQ-5D-5 L', 'Family caregiver', 'Leukemia', 'Reliability', 'Validity']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2798-4735'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this prospective study is to describe implementation of the protocol and resultant dosimetry. Nongraphic manual treatment planning using 6 MV photons, isocentric delivery, 40 x 40 cm field size, wall-mounted lasers to verify positioning, a lucite beam spoiler (without use of bolus material), a dose rate of 8.75 cGy/min at patient isocenter, and a source-to-axis distance of 338 cm were used for TBI. A monitor unit calculation formula was derived using ion chamber measurements and a solid water phantom. Five thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used at various anatomic locations in each of four cadaver dogs, to verify fidelity of the monitor unit formula prior to clinical implementation. In vivo dosimetric data were then collected with five TLDs at various anatomic locations in six patients treated with TBI. A total dose of 10 Gy divided into two 5 Gy fractions was delivered approximately 16 h apart, immediately followed by autologous stem cell transplant. The mean difference between prescribed and delivered doses ranged from 99% to 109% for various sites in cadavers, and from 83% to 121% in clinical patients. The mean total body dose in cadavers and clinical patients when whole body dose was estimated by averaging doses measured by variably placed TLDs ranged from 98% to 108% and 93% to 102% of the prescribed dose, respectively, which was considered acceptable.

As a secreted extracellular matrix protein, cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) plays an important role in the resistance of solid tumors to chemotherapy, but its role in CML is unclear. In the present study, we observed that Cyr61 levels were upregulated in the plasma and bone marrow (BM) of patients with CML as well as in K562 cells. This upregulation of Cyr61 significantly decreased IM-induced cellular apoptosis of K562 cells through nuclear factor kappa B/B-cell lymphoma 2 pathways. Inhibition of Cyr61 restored the chemosensitivity of K562 cells to IM both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results showed for the first time that Cyr61 plays an important role in regulating the chemosensitivity of CML cells to IM, suggesting that selectively targeting Cyr61 directly or its relevant effector pathways may provide potential value in improving the clinical response of patients with CML to IM treatment.","['2018-ZQN-69/The Training Project for Young and Middleaged Core Talents in Health', 'System of Fujian Province', '2018-ZQN-69 and 2016-ZQN-31/The Training Project for Young and Middle-aged Core', 'Talents in Health System of Fujian Province', '81700098/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016J01569/Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province', '2019J01151/Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province']",PMC6676106,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cyr61', 'apoptosis', 'chemosensitivity', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib mesylate']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0049-9289'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The NPM1 insertion mutations define the largest distinct genetic subset, approximately 30% of AML, and is considered a favorable risk marker if there is no (or low allelic ratio) FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) mutation. However, approximately 40% of patients with mutated NPM1 without FLT3 ITD still relapse, and the factors that drive relapse are still not fully understood. We used a next-generation sequencing panel to examine mutations at diagnosis; clearance of mutations after therapy, and gain/loss of mutations at relapse to prioritize mutations that contribute to relapse. Triple mutation of NPM1, DNMT3A and IDH1/2 showed a trend towards inferior overall survival in our discovery dataset, and was significantly associated with reduced OS in a large independent validation cohort. Analysis of relative variant allele frequencies suggests that early mutation and expansion of DNMT3A and IDH1/2 prior to acquisition of NPM1 mutation leads to increased risk of relapse. This subset of patients may benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplant or clinical trials with IDH inhibitors.","['U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MRSG-17-040-01 - LIB/American Cancer Society/International', 'LLS SCOR 7005-11/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society/International']",PMC6771683,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6399-6592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2103-5144', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8844-2345']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Recently, our data suggested that tumor cells were cured by AdCN205-IL-24, an adenovirus serotype 5-based conditionally replicating adenovirus expressing IL-24 after infection. METHODS: In this study, we created a novel fiber chimeric oncolytic adenovirus AdCN306-IL-24 that has Ad11 tropism and approved CAR (coxsackie adenovirus receptor, CAR)-independent cell entry, which could allow development of selective cytopathic effects (CPE) in APL cells in vitro. RESULTS: Formidable cytotoxic effect was specifically implemented in APL cells after infection with AdCN306-IL-24. The expression of IL-24 was up-regulated upon treated with accepted tumors. And the vector also induced superior cytolytic effects activity in APL cells by activation of programmed cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggested that chimeric oncolytic adenovirus AdCN306-IL-24 could express IL-24 gene, representing a potential therapeutics for acute promyelocytic leukemia.",,PMC6708966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of T cells in utero is associated with the fetal inflammatory response with broad implications for the health of the fetus and of the pregnancy. However, the characteristics of the fetal effector T cells that contribute to this process are largely unknown. METHODS: We analyzed primary human fetal lymphoid and mucosal tissues and performed phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional analysis to identify T cells with pro-inflammatory potential. The frequency and function of fetal-specific effector T cells was assessed in the cord blood of infants with localized and systemic inflammatory pathologies and compared to healthy term controls. RESULTS: We identified a transcriptionally distinct population of CD4+ T cells characterized by expression of the transcription factor Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF). PLZF+ CD4+ T cells were specifically enriched in the fetal intestine, possessed an effector memory phenotype, and rapidly produced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Engagement of the C-type lectin CD161 on these cells inhibited TCR-dependent production of IFNgamma in a fetal-specific manner. IFNgamma-producing PLZF+ CD4+ T cells were enriched in the cord blood of infants with gastroschisis, a natural model of chronic inflammation originating from the intestine, as well as in preterm birth, suggesting these cells contribute to fetal systemic immune activation. CONCLUSION: Our work reveals a fetal-specific program of protective immunity whose dysregulation is associated with fetal and neonatal inflammatory pathologies.","['K12 HD072222/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 AI136336/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI128007/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD021822/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK063720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6715406,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Development', '*Immunology', '*T cell development']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a known risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lack of the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in combination with HCV fosters hepatocarcinogenesis via induction of HCC using diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in a rodent model. However, the spontaneous development of malignant lesions in PML-deficient mice with an HCV-transgene (HCVtg ) has not been investigated thus far. We crossed PML-deficient mice with HCV transgene expressing mice and observed the animals for a period of 12 months. Livers were examined macroscopically and histologically. Gene expression analysis was performed on these samples, and compared with expression of selected genes in human samples of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. In vitro studies were performed in order to analyze the selected pathways. Genetic depletion of PML in combination with HCVtg coincided with an increased hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in development of HCCs in 40% of the PML-deficient livers. No tumor development was observed in mice with either the PML-knockout (PML(-/-) ) or HCVtg alone. Gene expression profiling uncovered pathways involved in cell proliferation, such as NLRP12 and RASFF6. These findings were verified in samples from human livers of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. Further in vitro studies confirmed that lack of PML, NLRP12, and RASFF6 leads to increased cell proliferation. The lack of PML in combination with HCV is associated with increased cell proliferation, fostering tumor development in the liver. Our data demonstrate that PML acts as an important tumor suppressor in HCV-dependent liver pathology.",,PMC6639172,,['NOTNLM'],"['*hepatitis C virus', '*hepatocellular carcinoma', '*liver tumor', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7270-2250'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Contemporary data describing treatment patterns, adverse events (AEs), and outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in clinical practice are lacking. We conducted a retrospective cohort study and assessed treatment patterns, AEs, health-care resource use (HCRU), and costs in patients with diagnosis of CLL. METHODS: Using a nationally representative population of privately insured patients in the US, adult patients with CLL diagnosis (July 2012-June 2015) were selected if they had continuous health plan enrollment for >/=12 months before the first CLL diagnosis without any evidence of any CLL-directed treatment. Treatment patterns up to four lines of therapy (LOT) and occurrence of AEs during CLL therapies were assessed. Mean per-patient monthly HCRU and costs were assessed overall and by number of unique AEs. RESULTS: Of all patients meeting the selection criteria (n = 7,639; median age, 66 years), 18% (n = 1,379) received a systemic therapy during study follow-up. Of these, bendamustine/rituximab (BR) was the most common first observed regimen (28.1%), while ibrutinib was the most common therapy in the second (20.8%) and third (25.5%) observed regimens. The mean monthly all-cause and CLL-related costs, among patients treated with a systemic therapy, were $7,943 (SD = $15,757) and $5,185 (SD = $9,935), respectively. Mean monthly all-cause costs increased by the number of AEs (from $905 [SD = $1,865] among those with no AEs to $6,032 [SD = $13,290] among those with >/=6 AEs). CONCLUSIONS: Chemoimmunotherapy, particularly BR, was the most common first observed therapy for CLL, whereas ibrutinib was most preferred in the second and third observed lines of therapy during the study period.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGh) on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury of mouse flaps. METHODS: Healthy mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows: sham group, the IR group, the sham+rhGH group and the IR+rhGH group, with 12 mice in each group. Skin pathology was tested by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The flap survival of each group was measured after 7 days. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined using corresponding kit. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in serum and flap were respectively measured by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The expressions of cleaved caspase-3, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), MnSOD, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and galectin-3 and (p)-p65 were analyzed by RT-PCR or/and Western blot. RESULTS: Prophylactic systemic application of recombinant human GH reduced the pathological damage of skin IR and significantly improved the flap survival of IR in mice, accompanied by elevation of VEGF. After administration of recombinant human GH, the activity of SOD/MnSOD in the flap was significantly increased, while the content of MDA was decreased. Cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were downregulated and Bcl-2 was upregulated in IR+rhGH group, compared to IR group. The levels of TLR4, Galectin-3 and p-p65 were decreased by rhGH. CONCLUSION: rhGH had protective effects on flap IR injury, and can be used as a drug intervention target for the treatment of skin flap IR injury.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*flap', '*ischemia-reperfusion injury', '*recombinant human growth hormone']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0896-9361'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present a hybrid simulation study where we simulate a synthetic dataset based on an existing study and use it to assess the sensitivity of EMF-leukemia associations to different scenarios of uncontrolled confounding by mobility under two major hypotheses of the infectious etiology of childhood leukemia. We then used the findings to conduct sensitivity analysis and empirically offset the potential bias due to unmeasured mobility in the California Power Line Study dataset. RESULTS: As expected, the stronger the assumed relationship between mobility and exposure and outcome, the greater the potential bias. However, no scenario created a bias strong enough to completely explain away previously observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that uncontrolled confounding by residential mobility had some impact on the estimated effect of EMF exposures on childhood leukemia, but that it was unlikely to be the primary explanation behind previously observed largely consistent, but unexplained associations.",['10007993/Electric Power Research Institute'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'Electromagnetic fields', 'Residential mobility', 'Simulation']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4587-9421', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9067-1697', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3114-2277']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Secondary poor graft function (sPGF) is defined as secondary cytopenia after initial engraftment of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). It has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis; however, there are very few reports on the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of sPGF. Between January 2015 and December 2015, 564 patients, who received transplantation at Peking University People's Hospital, were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 490 patients who achieved initial engraftment of both neutrophils and platelets, 28 patients developed sPGF. The cumulative incidence of sPGF on day 100 was 5.7%. The median time of sPGF was 54.5 (34-91) days after transplantation. Low (< median) CD34+ cell dose (p = 0.019, HR 3.07 (95% CI, 1.207-7.813)), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation (p = 0.009, HR 3.648 (95%CI, 1.382-9.629)), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (p = 0.003, HR 7.827 (95%CI, 2.002-30.602)) were identified as independent risk factors for sPGF. There was no significant difference in PGF incidence between the matched sibling donor (MSD) group and haploidentical donor (HID) group (p = 0.44). The overall survival of patients with sPGF at 1 year after transplantation was significantly poorer than that of patients with good graft function (GGF) (50.5% versus 87.2%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, sPGF developed in 5.7% patients after allo-SCT, especially in patients with CMV, EBV reactivation, or infusion with a low dose of CD34+ cells. The prognosis of sPGF is still poor owing to a lack of standard treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Poor graft function']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may constitute a control mechanism of the innate immune system; nevertheless, its role as an inhibitory receptor remains elusive. Using human NK cells as a cellular model, we analyzed CD33 inhibitory function upon different activating receptors. In high-cytotoxicity NKL cells, CD33 displayed a prominent inhibition on cytotoxicity triggered by the activating receptors NKG2D and, in a lower extent, 2B4, whereas it did not inhibit NKp46-induced cytotoxicity. NKp46 was partially inhibited by CD33 only when low-cytotoxicity NKL cells were tested. CD33 triggering did not inhibit IFN-gamma secretion, contrasting with ILT-2 and CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors that inhibited cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion induced by all activating receptors tested. CD33-mediated inhibition of NKG2D-induced triggering involved Vav1 dephosphorylation. Our results support the role of CD33 as an inhibitory receptor preferentially regulating the NKG2D/DAP10 cytotoxic signaling pathway, which could be involved in self-tolerance and tumor and infected cell recognition.",,PMC6501159,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6727-8320', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3947-1064', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6913-0610', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2922-4804']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activity of these genes underlies the generation of hematological malignancies notably T-cell leukemia. Here, we searched for deregulated NKL homeobox genes in main entities of T-cell lymphomas comprising angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL), NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Our data revealed altogether 19 aberrantly overexpressed genes in these types, demonstrating deregulated NKL homeobox genes involvement in T-cell lymphomas as well. For detailed analysis we focused on NKL homeobox gene MSX1 which is normally expressed in NK-cells. MSX1 was overexpressed in subsets of HSTL patients and HSTL-derived sister cell lines DERL-2 and DERL-7 which served as models to characterize mechanisms of deregulation. We performed karyotyping, genomic and expression profiling, and whole genome sequencing to reveal mutated and deregulated gene candidates, including the fusion gene CD53-PDGFRB. Subsequent knockdown experiments allowed the reconstruction of an aberrant network involved in MSX1 deregulation, including chromatin factors AUTS2 and mutated histone HIST1H3B(K27M). The gene encoding AUTS2 is located at chromosome 7q11 and may represent a basic target of the HSTL hallmark aberration i(7q). Taken together, our findings highlight an oncogenic role for deregulated NKL homeobox genes in T-cell lymphoma and identify MSX1 as a novel player in HSTL, implicated in aberrant NK- and T-cell differentiation.",,PMC6524933,,['NOTNLM'],"['HSTL', 'NKL-code', 'T-ALL', 'homeobox']",,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional chemotherapy has been the standard treatment approach for AML in the past 40 years with limited success. Although, several targeted drugs were recently approved, their long-term impact on survival of patients with AML is yet to be determined. Thus, it is still necessary to develop alternative therapeutic approaches for this disease. We have previously shown a marked synergistic anti-leukemic effect of two polyphenols, curcumin (CUR) and carnosic acid (CA), on AML cells in-vitro and in-vivo. In this study, we identified another phenolic compound, methyl 4-hydroxycinnamate (MHC), which among several tested phytochemicals could uniquely cooperate with CA in killing AML cells, but not normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Notably, our data revealed striking phenotypical and mechanistic similarities in the apoptotic effects of MHC+CA and CUR+CA on AML cells. Yet, we show that MHC is a non-fluorescent molecule, which is an important technical advantage over CUR that can interfere in various fluorescence-based assays. Collectively, we demonstrated for the first time the antileukemic activity of MHC in combination with another phenolic compound. This type of synergistically acting combinations may represent prototypes for novel antileukemic therapy.",,PMC6521573,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'calcium-dependent apoptosis', 'carnosic acid', 'curcumin', 'methyl 4-hydroxycinnamate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer that derives pro-survival/proliferative signals from the bone marrow (BM) niche. Novel agents targeting not only cancer cells, but also the BM-niche have shown the greatest activity in MM. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are therapeutic targets in MM and we previously showed that HDAC3 inhibition decreases MM proliferation both alone and in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). In this study, we investigate the effects of HDAC3 targeting in BMSCs. Using both BMSC lines as well as patient-derived BMSCs, we show that HDAC3 expression in BMSCs can be induced by co-culture with MM cells. Knock-out (KO), knock-down (KD), and pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 in BMSCs results in decreased MM cell proliferation; including in autologous cultures of patient MM cells with BMSCs. We identified both quantitative and qualitative changes in exosomes and exosomal miRNA, as well as inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling, as molecular mechanisms mediating anti-MM activity. Furthermore, we show that HDAC3-KD in BM endothelial cells decreases neoangiogenesis, consistent with a broad effect of HDAC3 targeting in the BM-niche. Our results therefore support the clinical development of HDAC3 inhibitors based not only on their direct anti-MM effects, but also their modulation of the BM microenvironment.","['R01 CA178264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6883144,['NIHMS1527350'],,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8850-0442'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases (n = 647) were patients with second cancer (SC: carcinoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, hematological second cancer, and melanoma) and controls (n = 1234) were patients without SC, matched with cases for sex, age at MPN diagnosis, date of MPN diagnosis, and MPN disease duration. The aim was to evaluate the risk of SC after exposure to cytoreductive drugs. Patients exposed to hydroxyurea (HU) (median: 3 years) had a risk of SC similar to unexposed patients (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.82-1.38). In contrast, in cancer-specific stratified multivariable analysis, HU had two-fold higher risk of non-melanoma (NM) skin cancer (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.15-4.51). A significantly higher risk of NM-skin cancer was also documented for pipobroman (OR = 3.74, 95% CI 1.00-14.01), ruxolitinib (OR = 3.87, 95% CI 1.18-12.75), and for drug combination (OR = 3.47, 95% CI 1.55-7.75). These three drugs did not show excess risk of carcinoma and hematological second cancer compared with unexposed patients. Exposure to interferon, busulfan, and anagrelide did not increase the risk. In summary, while it is reassuring that no excess of carcinoma was documented, a careful dermatologic active surveillance before and during the course of treatments is recommended.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8367-5668', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5178-5827', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4415-2906', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7572-9504', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5129-8597', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5755-0730']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 29.,"How the genomic features of a patient's cancer relate to individual disease kinetics remains poorly understood. Here we used the indolent growth dynamics of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to analyse the growth rates and corresponding genomic patterns of leukaemia cells from 107 patients with CLL, spanning decades-long disease courses. We found that CLL commonly demonstrates not only exponential expansion but also logistic growth, which is sigmoidal and reaches a certain steady-state level. Each growth pattern was associated with marked differences in genetic composition, the pace of disease progression and the extent of clonal evolution. In a subset of patients, whose serial samples underwent next-generation sequencing, we found that dynamic changes in the disease course of CLL were shaped by the genetic events that were already present in the early slow-growing stages. Finally, by analysing the growth rates of subclones compared with their parental clones, we quantified the growth advantage conferred by putative CLL drivers in vivo.","['R01 CA216273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HG002295/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA206978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA155010-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA081534-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01HL103532-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6630176,['NIHMS1039357'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study the role of VMP1 was analysed in CD34(+) cells of cord blood (CB) and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and cell lines. An increased expression of VMP1 was observed in a subset of AML patients. Functional studies in normal CB CD34(+) cells indicated that inhibiting VMP1 expression reduced autophagic-flux, coinciding with reduced expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), delayed differentiation, increased apoptosis and impaired in vivo engraftment. Comparable results were observed in leukemic cell lines and primary AML CD34(+) cells. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that leukemic cells overexpressing VMP1 displayed a reduced number of mitochondrial structures, while the number of lysosomal degradation structures was increased. The overexpression of VMP1 did not affect cell proliferation and differentiation, but increased autophagic-flux and improved mitochondrial quality, which coincided with an increased threshold for venetoclax-induced loss of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. In conclusion, our data indicate that in leukemic cells high VMP1 is involved with mitochondrial quality control.",,PMC6541608,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8452-8555'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, four different gamma-secretase complexes exist, and available inhibitors block all complexes equally. As a result, these cause severe ""on-target"" gastrointestinal tract, skin, and thymus toxicity, limiting their therapeutic application. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) subclass of gamma-secretase complexes is highly effective in decreasing leukemia while avoiding dose-limiting toxicities. Clinically, T-ALL samples were found to selectively express only PSEN1-containing gamma-secretase complexes. The conditional knockout of Psen1 in developing T cells attenuated the development of a mutant NOTCH1-driven leukemia in mice in vivo but did not abrogate normal T cell development. Treatment of T-ALL cell lines with the selective PSEN1 inhibitor MRK-560 effectively decreased mutant NOTCH1 processing and led to cell cycle arrest. These observations were extended to T-ALL patient-derived xenografts in vivo, demonstrating that MRK-560 treatment decreases leukemia burden and increased overall survival without any associated gut toxicity. Therefore, PSEN1-selective compounds provide a potential therapeutic strategy for safe and effective targeting of T-ALL and possibly also for other diseases in which NOTCH signaling plays a role.",['617340/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0848-9851', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5182-8535', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5463-4231', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7506-7689', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2939-2453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2439-3502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8193-5734', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3154-4708', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6272-4085', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5781-0288', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6626-5843', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5455-5819']","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Print 2019 Aug 15.,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) regulatory proteins Tax and HBZ play indispensable roles in regulating viral and cellular gene expression. BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has been demonstrated to be essential not only for Tax transactivation but also for viral replication. We sought to investigate the physical interaction between HBZ and BRG1 and to determine the effect of these interactions on Tax-mediated long terminal repeat (LTR) activation. We reveal that HTLV-1 cell lines and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells harbor high levels of BRG1. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we have demonstrated physical interactions between BRG1 and HBZ and characterized the protein domains involved. Moreover, we have identified the PBAF signature subunits BAF200 and BAF180 as novel interaction partners of HBZ, suggesting that the PBAF complex may be required for HTLV-1 transcriptional repression by HBZ. Additionally, we found that BRG1 expression translocates HBZ into distinct nuclear foci. We show that HBZ substantially represses HTLV-1 LTR activation by Tax/BRG1. Interestingly, we found that Tax stabilizes the expression of exogenous and endogenous BRG1 and that HBZ reverses this effect. Finally, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) assay, we illustrate that HBZ facilitates the downregulation of HTLV-1 transcription by deregulating the recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to the promoter. Overall, we conclude that SWI/SNF complexes, in addition to other cellular transcription factors, are involved in HBZ-mediated suppression of HTLV-1 viral gene expression.IMPORTANCE The pathogenic potential of HTLV-1 is linked to the indispensable multifaceted functions of the viral regulatory proteins Tax and HBZ, encoded by the sense and antisense viral transcripts, respectively. The interaction between Tax and the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes has been associated with HTLV-1 transcriptional activation. To date, the relationship between the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family and HBZ, the only viral protein that is consistently expressed in infected cells and ATL cells, has not been elucidated. Here, we have characterized the biological significance of the SWI/SNF family in regard to viral transcriptional repression by HBZ. This is important because it provides a better understanding of the function and role of HBZ in downregulating viral transcription and, hence, its contribution to viral latency and persistence in vivo, a process that may ultimately lead to the development of ATL.",,PMC6675893,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BRG1', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*PBAF', '*SWI/SNF', '*Tax', '*leukemia']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and its ligand LIF play a critical role in cancer progression, metastasis, stem cell maintenance, and therapy resistance. Here, we describe a rationally designed first-in-class inhibitor of LIFR, EC359, which directly interacts with LIFR to effectively block LIF/LIFR interactions. EC359 treatment exhibits antiproliferative effects, reduces invasiveness and stemness, and promotes apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. The activity of EC359 is dependent on LIF and LIFR expression, and treatment with EC359 attenuated the activation of LIF/LIFR-driven pathways, including STAT3, mTOR, and AKT. Concomitantly, EC359 was also effective in blocking signaling by other LIFR ligands (CTF1, CNTF, and OSM) that interact at LIF/LIFR interface. EC359 significantly reduced tumor progression in TNBC xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and reduced proliferation in patient-derived primary TNBC explants. EC359 exhibits distinct pharmacologic advantages, including oral bioavailability, and in vivo stability. Collectively, these data support EC359 as a novel targeted therapeutic that inhibits LIFR oncogenic signaling.See related commentary by Shi et al., p. 1337.","['P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178499/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA179120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6677593,['NIHMS1530198'],,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6056-6992', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4964-3720', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8384-2793', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6032-0354', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3985-253X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5152-5235']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,['Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Aug;18(8):1337-1340.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) and various blood biomarkers in healthy adults. METHODS: A self-controlled interventional study was conducted. Serial measurements of dCA were performed at 7 time points (7, 9, and 11 am; 2, 5, and 8 pm, and 8 am on the next day) without or with RIPC, carried out at 7:20 to 8 am. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline (7 am) and 1 hour after RIPC, and blood biomarkers, including 5 neuroprotective factors and 25 inflammation-related biomarkers, were measured with a quantitative protein chip. RESULTS: Fifty participants were enrolled (age 34.54 +/- 12.01 years, 22 men). Compared with the results on the day without RIPC, dCA was significantly increased at 6 hours after RIPC, and the increase was sustained for at least 24 hours. After RIPC, 2 neuroprotective factors (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor-A) and 4 inflammation-related biomarkers (transforming growth factor-beta1, leukemia inhibitory factor, matrix metallopeptidase-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) were significantly elevated compared with their baseline levels. Conversely, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was significantly lower compared with its baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: RIPC induces a sustained increase of dCA from 6 to at least 24 hours after treatment in healthy adults. In addition, several neuroprotective and inflammation-related blood biomarkers were differentially regulated shortly after RIPC. The increased dCA and altered blood biomarkers may collectively contribute to the beneficial effects of RIPC on cerebrovascular function.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Exploitation of the immune system has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the mechanisms of immune evasion during leukemia progression remain poorly understood. We sought to understand the role of calcineurin in ALL and observed that depletion of calcineurin B (CnB) in leukemia cells dramatically prolongs survival in immune-competent but not immune-deficient recipients. Immune-competent recipients were protected from challenge with leukemia if they were first immunized with CnB-deficient leukemia, suggesting robust adaptive immunity. In the bone marrow (BM), recipients of CnB-deficient leukemia harbored expanded T-cell populations as compared with controls. Gene expression analyses of leukemia cells extracted from the BM identified Cn-dependent significant changes in the expression of immunoregulatory genes. Increased secretion of IL12 from CnB-deficient leukemia cells was sufficient to induce T-cell activation ex vivo, an effect that was abolished when IL12 was neutralized. Strikingly, recombinant IL12 prolonged survival of mice challenged with highly aggressive B-ALL. Moreover, gene expression analyses from children with ALL showed that patients with higher expression of either IL12A or IL12B exhibited prolonged survival. These data suggest that leukemia cells are dependent upon calcineurin for immune evasion by restricting the regulation of proinflammatory genes, particularly IL12. SIGNIFICANCE: This report implicates calcineurin as an intracellular signaling molecule responsible for immune evasion during leukemia progression and raises the prospect of re-examining IL12 as a therapeutic in leukemia.","['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008730/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6889000,['NIHMS1530566'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5837-7087', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3820-1724', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0520-1624']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to highlight it, as often these cases are misdiagnosed and mismanaged, specially when presenting with an atypical initial presentation. This case report describes an unusual initial clinical presentation of HES. Patient was a 75-year lady presenting to Rheumatology Clinic with short duration of fever and polyarthritis. Joint aspiration showed purulent fluid with a cell count of 61,000/mm3 with predominant neutrophils and eosinophils. Her peripheral blood also showed a high white blood cell (WBC) count (80,700/mm3 with 73% eosinophils). Her workup for eosinophilic leukemia was negative, so a diagnosis of HES was made. She was initiated on corticosteroids and hydroxycarbamide as first-line therapy.

Even more potent antitumor immunity can be induced by strategies to stimulate T cells with their profoundly higher effector potential. However, upon increased immunostimulatory potential, the necessity to target highly tumor-specific antigens becomes critically important to reduce side effects. METHODS: We here report on bispecific fusion proteins (BFP) that target ligands of the immunoreceptor NKG2D (NKG2DL), which are widely expressed on malignant cells but generally absent on healthy tissue. They consist of the extracellular domain of NKG2D as targeting moiety fused to Fab-fragments of CD3 (NKG2D-CD3) or CD16 (NKG2D-CD16) antibodies. RESULTS: NKG2D-CD16 displayed increased affinity to the FcgammaRIII on NK cells compared to engineered Fc-parts, which are contained in optimized mAbs that presently undergo clinical evaluation. In line, NKG2D-CD16 induced superior activation, degranulation, IFN-gamma production and lysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and patient AML cells. NKG2D-CD3 in turn potently stimulated T cells, and comparison of efficacy over time revealed that NKG2D-CD16 was superior upon short term application, while NKG2D-CD3 mediated overall more potent effects which manifested after longer times. This can be attributed to treatment-induced proliferation of T cells but not NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we here introduce novel ""antibody-like"" BFP that take advantage of the highly tumor-restricted expression of NKG2DL and potently activate the reactivity of NK cells or T cells for immunotherapy of AML.",,PMC6542021,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Bispecific', '*CD16', '*CD3', '*Fc-optimized', '*Fusion protein', '*Leukemia', '*NKG2DL', '*mAb']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) is essential for maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia population which is terminologically called spermatogonia progenitor cells (SPCs). AIMS: We aim to figure out the molecular connections between androgen and fates of PLZF(+) SPCs population. METHOD: Immunohistochemistry was conducted to confirm that postnatal testicular germ cells lacked endogenous AR. Subsequently, total cells were isolated from 5 dpp (day post partum) mouse testes, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and/or bicalutamide treatment manifested that Plzf was indirectly regulated by androgen. Then, Sertoli cells were purified to screen downstream targets of AR using ChIP-seq, and gene silence and overexpression were used to attest these interactions in Sertoli cells or SPCs-Sertoli cells co-culture system. Finally, these connections were further verified in vivo using androgen pharmacological deprivation mouse model. RESULTS: Gata2 is identified as a target of AR, and beta1-integrin is a target of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) in Sertoli cells. Androgen signal negatively regulate beta1-integrin on Sertoli cells via Gata2 and WT1, and beta1-integrin on Sertoli cells interacts with E-cadherin on SPCs to regulate SPCs fates.

Heilongjiang Province, China, is rich in dairy cattle. However, its current BLV epidemiology and genotypes have still not been evaluated and confirmed. In this report, we investigated the BLV epidemiology in dairy cattle in the major regions of Heilongjiang Province via the nested PCR assay. RESULTS: A total of 730 blood samples were collected from nine different farms in six regions of Heilongjiang. The results showed that the infection rate of these regions ranged from null to 31%. With a clustering analysis of 60 published BLV env sequences, genotypes 1 and 6 were confirmed to be circulating in Heilongjiang. Importantly, a new genotype, 11, and a new subgenotype, 6E, were also identified in the Harbin and Daqing regions, respectively. An epitope analysis showed that a cluster of T-X-D-X-R-XXXX-A sequences in genotype 11 gp51 neutralizing domain 2 was unique among all currently known BLV isolates and was therefore a defining feature of this new genotype. CONCLUSIONS: BLV epidemics and genotypes were initially investigated in dairy cattle of Heilongjiang. A relatively high infection rate was found in some regions of this province. A new genotype, G11, with a highly specific motif, was identified and thus added as a new member to the current BLV genotype family.

Survivin-responsive, conditionally replicating adenoviruses regulated by multiple tumor-specific factors (Surv.m-CRAs), in which the expression of the adenoviral early region 1A gene is regulated by the survivin (BIRC5) promoter, can be used to treat several cancers. As survivin is overexpressed in ATL, we examined the effects of Surv.m-CRAs on ATL-selective replication and survival. METHODS: We tested two ATL cell lines and four HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. The cells were subjected to infection with either E1-deleted, replication-defective adenoviruses or Surv.m-CRAs at various multiplicities of infection. RESULTS: Strong activation of survivin promoter was observed in all six cell lines. Moreover, the expression of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), which is important for adenoviral infection, was high in the cell lines. In contrast, we observed the absence of survivin promoter activity and a low expression of CAR in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy subjects. Surv.m-CRAs actively replicated and induced cytocidal effects in five out of six cell lines; conversely, we observed minimal viral replication and no marked cytotoxicity in normal activated PBLs.

During the last decade, multiple genomic studies have identified a myriad of somatic events driving CLL proliferation and aggressivity. Nevertheless, and despite the mounting evidence of inherited risk for CLL development, the existence of germline variants associated with clinical outcomes has not been addressed in depth. METHODS: Exome sequencing data from control leukocytes of CLL patients involved in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was used for genotyping. Cox regression was used to detect variants associated with clinical outcomes. Gene and pathways level associations were also calculated. RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms in PPP4R2 and MAP3K4 were associated with earlier treatment need. A gene-level analysis evidenced a significant association of RIPK3 with both treatment need and survival. Furthermore, germline variability in pathways such as apoptosis, cell-cycle, pentose phosphate, GNalpha13 and Nitric oxide was associated with overall survival.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, has altered the treatment perspective of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and showed modest activity against several types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. According to phase studies and real-world data, reported serious adverse effects included atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, and bleeding diathesis. However, heart failure was not reported to be a probable adverse effect linked with ibrutinib. CASE REPORT: In this paper, we present a 66-year-old female chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient who developed significant and symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction at the 13th month of ibrutinib treatment. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Following cessation of ibrutinib, ejection fraction and clinical findings of the left ventricular dysfunction alleviated. DISCUSSION: Although the use of ibrutinib is generally well tolerated, cardiac functions should be monitored occasionally in all patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Ibrutinib', 'cardiomyopathy', 'left ventricular dysfunction']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7681-4623', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5589-3000']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 30.,"Objective: Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells majorly modulated by various environmental factors. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine from interleukin-6 family. Previous studies demonstrate that LIF is associated with several tolerogenic events; yet the exact effect of this cytokine on the generation and function of DCs was not explicitly identified. Materials and methods: To clarify the role of LIF in DCs development, immature DCs were differentiated from mouse bone marrow (BM) in a GM-CSF and IL-4 containing medium with or without LIF. Afterwards, in maturation process, the differentiated DCs were exposed to TNF-alpha in the presence or absence of LIF. Results: Immature DCs differentiated in the presence of LIF, proved a significant enhancement in the expression of MHCII, CD40, or CD86 molecules and in the antigen uptake function. LIF treatment of normal DCs while stimulating for maturation, caused a significant decrement in the expression of phenotypic markers as well as an increment in the antigen uptake function in comparison with TNF-alpha-only stimulated cells; however, the reduced ability for induction of allogenic T-cell proliferation proved no statistical significance. Conclusions: Our results can reflect a role for LIF in the generation and particularly maturation of DCs. It can be assumed that LIF rather modulates the maturation level, leading to the development of semi-mature and tolerogenic DCs. According to the high levels of LIF in immune-privileged sites like brain and uterine, it seems that the cytokine may account for the formation of local DCs that help the establishment of immunosuppressive environments.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', 'dendritic cell', 'differentiation', 'maturation', 'tolerogenic DC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that not only PLZF expression itself but also the relative abundance of PLZF proteins plays critical roles in iNKT cell development. Utilizing a Zbtb16 hypomorphic allele, PLZF(GFPCre), which produces PLZF proteins at only half of the level of the wild-type allele, we show that decreased PLZF expression results in a significant decrease in iNKT cell numbers, which is further associated with profound alterations in iNKT lineage choices and subset composition. These results document that there is a quantitative aspect of PLZF expression in iNKT cells, demonstrating that the availability of PLZF protein is a critical factor for both effective iNKT cell generation and subset differentiation.","['ZIA BC011214/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011215/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8274958,['NIHMS1706944'],['NOTNLM'],"['*IFN-gamma', '*IL-4', '*iNKT cells', '*thymus', '*transcription factor']",,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical investigations have indicated potential synergistic interaction of their combination. METHODS: We conducted an investigator-initiated phase 2 study of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax involving previously untreated high-risk and older patients with CLL. All patients had at least one of the following features: chromosome 17p deletion, mutated TP53, chromosome 11q deletion, unmutated IGHV, or an age of 65 years or older. Patients received ibrutinib monotherapy (420 mg once daily) for 3 cycles, followed by the addition of venetoclax (weekly dose escalation to 400 mg once daily). Combined therapy was administered for 24 cycles. Response assessments were performed according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria. Minimal residual disease was assessed by means of multicolor flow cytometry in bone marrow (sensitivity, 10(-4)). RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were treated. The median age was 65 years (range, 26 to 83). A total of 30% of the patients were 70 years of age or older. Overall, 92% of the patients had unmutated IGHV, TP53 aberration, or chromosome 11q deletion. With combined treatment, the proportions of patients who had complete remission (with or without normal blood count recovery) and remission with undetectable minimal residual disease increased over time. After 12 cycles of combined treatment, 88% of the patients had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery, and 61% had remission with undetectable minimal residual disease. Responses were noted in older adults and across all high-risk subgroups. Three patients had laboratory evidence of tumor lysis syndrome. The adverse-event profile was similar to what has been reported with ibrutinib and venetoclax. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, combined venetoclax and ibrutinib was an effective oral regimen for high-risk and older patients with CLL.

Epub 2019 Jun 26.,"Natural killer T (NKT) cells are alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR) expressing innate-like T cells that display natural killer (NK) cell markers. Based on TCR characteristics, they are divided into two groups restricted to the MHC class I-like molecule CD1d. Type I NKT cells, most extensively studied, are identified by a semi-invariant Valpha14-Jalpha18 (mouse, Valpha24-Jalpha18 in humans) TCR reactive to the prototypic ligand alpha-galactosylceramide presented on CD1d. In contrast, type II NKT cells display diverse TCR reacting to different CD1d-presented ligands. There are no reagents that identify all type II NKT cells, limiting their exploration. Here, we searched for novel type II NKT cells by comparing Jalpha18(-/-) MHCII(-/-) mice that harbour type II but not type I NKT cells, and CD1d(-/-) MHCII(-/-) mice, lacking all NKT cells. We identified significantly larger populations of CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD8(-) (double negative, DN) TCRbeta(+) cells expressing NKG2D or NKG2A/C/E in Jalpha18(-/-) MHCII(-/-) mice compared with CD1d(-/-) MHCII(-/-) mice, suggesting that 30%-50% of these cells were type II NKT cells. They expressed CD122, NK1.1, CXCR3 and intermediate/low levels of CD45RB. Further, the CD4(+) subset was CD69(+) , while the DN cells were CD49b(+) and CD62L(+) . Both subsets expressed the NKT cell-associated promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor and Tbet, while fewer cells expressed RORgammat. NKG2D(+) CD4(+) and DN populations were producers of IFN-gamma, but rarely IL-4 and IL-17. Taken together, we identify a novel subset of primary CD4(+) and DN type II NKT cells that expresses NKG2 receptors have typical NKT cell phenotypes and a TH1-like cytokine production.","['2017-01821/Vetenskapsradet', '180622/Cancerfonden', 'Adlerbertska Stiftelserna', 'Stiftelserna Wilhelm och Martina Lundgrens']",PMC6851763,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytokines', 'experimental animals', 'natural killer T cells', 'transcription factors']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6027-1553', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7665-6781']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 27.,"Although rare, CALM/AF10 is a chromosomal rearrangement found in immature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia, and mixed phenotype acute leukemia of T/myeloid lineages with poor prognosis. Moreover, this translocation is detected in 50% of T-ALL patients with gamma/delta T cell receptor rearrangement, frequently associated with low expression of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). However, the relevance of CEBPA low expression for CALM/AF10 leukemogenesis has not yet been evaluated. We generated double mutant mice, which express the Lck-CALM/AF10 fusion gene and are haploinsufficient for the Cebpa gene. To characterize the hematopoiesis, we quantified hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitor cells, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells, common myeloid progenitor cells, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. No significant difference was detected in any of the progenitor subsets. Finally, we tested if Cebpa haploinsufficiency would lead to the expansion of Mac-1+/B220+/c-Kit+ cells proposed as the CALM/AF10 leukemic progenitor. Less than 1% of bone marrow cells expressed Mac-1, B220, and c-Kit with no significant difference between groups. Our results showed that the reduction of Cebpa gene expression in Lck-CALM/AF10 mice did not affect their hematopoiesis or induce leukemia. Our data corroborated previous studies suggesting that the CALM/AF10 leukemia-initiating cells are early progenitors with lymphoid/myeloid differentiating potential.",,PMC6542091,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7983-6289', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5403-4052', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7841-3652', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3111-8506', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8099-9648', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8527-6601', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2202-9088', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1567-4086']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a descriptive observational study based on the nominal bank of the Brazilian Mortality Information System for the period from January 1st, 2000, to December 31st, 2012. The study analyzed the distribution death frequencies by sex and age. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated taking Goiania (Goias State), Acre State, and the North Region of Brazil as the references. A total of 81 deaths were identified, the majority in men (59.3%) and in individuals over 70 years of age. The five main sites in men were stomach, liver, colon and rectum, leukemia, and prostate. The five main sites in women were uterine cervix, stomach, liver, leukemia, and uterus. In indigenous men there was an excess of deaths from stomach cancer compared to the populations of Goiania (SMR = 2.72; 2.58-2.87), Acre State (SMR = 2.05; 1.94-2.16) and North region (SMR = 3.10; 2.93-3.27). The same was observed for deaths from hepatic cell carcinomas referenced against Goiania (SMR = 3.89; 3.66-4.14), Acre State (SMR = 1.79; 1.68-1.91), and the North of Brazil (SMR = 4.04; 3.77-4.30).

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Blood is an example of a highly regenerative tissue and its regeneration depends on the presence of stem cells residing in the bone marrow in humans. A better understanding of how these stem cells are programmed would benefit their use in clinical practice and shed light on the mechanisms by which the unique properties of stem cells are established. Our approach is to delineate the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify these cells during their development in the embryo, and we use the amphibian experimental model because a wealth of evidence shows that the mechanisms used are conserved in mammals including humans. Blood stem cells are made during the intraembryonic wave of hematopoiesis during embryonic development where they emerge from endothelial precursors in the floor of the dorsal aorta (DA). These cells are derived from lateral plate mesoderm and so we have focused on the subset of cells in the lateral plate mesoderm fated to become blood and endothelium known as definitive hemangioblasts. We have found that their programming results from the activities of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and the inhibition by miRNA of transforming growth factor beta signaling. VEGFA is first generated in the somites adjacent to the lateral plate mesoderm, and one of the responses of the lateral plate mesoderm is to activate endogenous VEGFA expression. BMP has multiple inputs into the programming of these cells via the activation of the transcription factor (TF), Gata2, and of the VEGFA receptor. These actions culminate in the expression of the leukemia-associated TF, Scl/Tal1, which is essential for blood fate specification. The activity of VEGFA in driving endothelial development resides in the small isoform, but the medium and large isoforms are required to initiate the blood stem cell program in the floor of the DA. The expression of the small isoform is dependent on the blood TF with leukemia connections, Tel1/Etv6, whereas the larger isoforms depend on another transcription-associated factor with leukemia connections, Eto2, raising the possibility that the regulation of VEGFA expression may be the mode of action of these leukemic factors. The action of Tel1/Etv6 in directly activating VEGFA expression in the somites was unexpected because this TF had only been reported to repress transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation technology, we were able to show that Tel1/Etv6 does indeed work by repressing the expression of a VEGFA repressor, FoxC3, but it also acts directly to activate VEGFA expression, working together with Klf4. Finally, we have also looked at the mesodermal population that gives rise to the earlier waves of hematopoiesis, which do not generate a stem cell. We find significant differences including differential use of TFs of the E-Twenty-Six (ETS) family. In conclusion, we have elucidated the GRN responsible for preparing the lateral mesoderm for blood stem cell production.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*blood', '*gene regulatory networks', '*stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 28.,"INTRODUCTION: Pegaspargase, a pegylated asparaginase, is a core component in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pegaspargase in liquid form has a limited shelf life of 8 months due to depegylation, leading to changes in purity and potency over time. Lyophilization is an approach that can improve the stability of biological drug conjugates. METHODS: Here we describe the development of a lyophilized formulation of pegaspargase and present results of a series of tests demonstrating that the lyophilized form has comparable physicochemical properties to the liquid form. RESULTS: Stability tests of critical quality attributes, including purity, potency, aggregates and total free polyethylene glycol, demonstrate that lyophilized pegaspargase remains stable for at least 3 years, with optimum stability achieved with storage under refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees C). CONCLUSIONS: Lyophilization improved the stability of pegaspargase without altering other physicochemical properties, permitting a prolonged shelf life of at least 2 years when stored at 2-8 degrees C. This may enable greater storage flexibility and allow for better management of pegaspargase. FUNDING: Study Sponsor: Baxalta (now part of Takeda).

Epub 2019 May 28.,"INTRODUCTION: No head-to-head studies have compared inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) and blinatumomab (Blina) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs), namely network meta-analysis (NMA), anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC), were conducted to compare the relative efficacy of these therapies. METHODS: Patient-level data from a study that evaluated InO with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (INO-VATE-ALL) and published data from a study that evaluated Blina with SoC chemotherapy (TOWER) were used in the analyses. Endpoints evaluated included remission rate defined as complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS). For each outcome, treatment-effect modifiers were adjusted for in the anchored MAIC and STC analyses. RESULTS: Analyses showed statistically significant higher rates of remission and HSCT with InO compared to Blina irrespective of the ITC method used or measure of the effect (i.e., odds ratio [OR] or rate difference). The treatment effects derived from the MAIC and STC analyses were consistent and stronger than those estimated from the NMA. A trend favoring InO was detected for EFS. The ITC results for OS suggest no difference between InO and Blina. CONCLUSION: Results from these ITCs indicated a statistically significant advantage for InO over Blina for rates of remission and HSCT in adults with relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL. It was not possible to fully adjust for all treatment-effect modifiers, and the similarity in chemotherapy regimens used in the SoC comparator arms of the INO-VATE-ALL and TOWER studies is worthy of further exploration. Both studies, however, used chemotherapy regimens that have a low response rate; therefore, no significant differences in efficacy outcomes are expected between SoC arms.

The key feature is time-independent, serial valving of mixing chambers by fill-level-coupled temperature change rate (FLC-TCR) actuated valving. The automated dilution is realized under continuous rotation which enables reliable control of wetting liquids without the need for any additional fabrication steps such as hydrophobic coating. All fluidic features are implemented in a monolithic fashion and disks are manufactured by foil thermoforming for scalable manufacturing. The new valving concept is demonstrated to reliably prevent valving if the diluted sample is not added to the mixing chamber (n = 30) and ensure valving if the dilution stage is completed (n = 15). The accuracy and precision of automated serial dilutions are verified by on-disk generation of qPCR standard curve dilutions and compared with manually generated reference dilutions. In a first step, the 5-log-stage standard curves are evaluated in a commercial qPCR thermocycler revealing a linearity of R2 >/= 99.92% for the proposed LabDisk method vs. R2 >/= 99.67% in manual reference dilutions. In a second step, the disk automated serial dilutions are combined with on-disk qPCR thermocycling and readout, both inside a LabDisk player. A 4-log-stage linearity of R2 >/= 99.81% and a sensitivity of one leukemia associated ETV6-RUNX1 mutant DNA copy in a background of 100 000 wild-type DNA copies are achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the efficacy and safety of TKI discontinuation but also exploring the factors contributing to successful TFR. Results: The search yielded 10 trials including 1,601 patients. For patients who discontinued TKIs, the estimated weighted mean incidence of major molecular relapse was 16% (95%CI: 11-21), 34% (95%CI: 29-38), 39% (95%CI: 35-43) and 41% (95%CI: 36-47) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Of these, 39, 82, and 95% of molecular losses occurred within the first 3, 6, and 12 months. In safety analysis, among patients without TFR, 98% (95% CI: 96-100) were sensitive to TKI retreatment. No new safety issues were identified except TKI withdrawal syndrome, which appeared during the early TFR phase, with a weighted mean incidence of 27% (95%CI: 19-35). Our subgroup analysis suggested better TFR associated with interferon therapy (P = 0.007), depth of molecular response (P = 0.018) and duration of DMR (P < 0.001). Conclusions: TFR as an extension of an approach to optimize management of CML is clinically feasible in approximately 59% of patients with sufficient TKI response.

Although India is the largest manufacturer of generic medicines, there is a paucity of information on availability, price and affordability of anti-neoplastic EMs, which this study evaluates. Methods: Using a modified WHO/Health Action International methodology, data were collected on availability and price of 33 strength-specific anti-neoplastic EMs and 4 non-cancer EMs. Seven 'survey anchor' hospitals (4 public and 3 private) and 32 private-sector retail pharmacies were surveyed. Median price ratios (MPRs) were calculated by comparing consumer prices with international reference prices (IRPs). Results: On average, across survey anchor areas (hospital and private-sector retail pharmacies combined), the mean availability of anti-neoplastic EMs and non-cancer medicines was 70% and 100%, respectively. Mean availability of anti-neoplastic EMs was 38% in private-sector retail pharmacies, 43% in public hospital pharmacies and 71% in private hospital pharmacies. Median MPR of lowest-priced generic versions was 0.71 in retail pharmacies. The estimated cost of chemotherapy medicines needed for treating a 30 kg child with standard-risk leukaemia was INR 27 850 (US$442) and INR 17 500 (US$278) for Hodgkin's lymphoma, requiring 88 and 55 days' wages, respectively, for the lowest paid government worker. Conclusion: Most anti-neoplastic EMs are found in survey anchor areas, however, mean availability was less than non-cancer medicines; not meeting the WHO target of 80%. Medicine prices were relatively low in New Delhi compared with IRPs. However, the cost of chemotherapy medicines seems unaffordable in the local context.",,PMC6509613,,['NOTNLM'],"['India', 'childhood cancer', 'essential medicines', 'generic medicines', 'medicines access', 'pharmacies']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8561-6194'],,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides this indirect regulatory role of miRNAs, they can also act as physiological ligands of specific TLRs and initiate the signaling cascade of immune response. In this review, we summarize the potential roles of miRNAs in regulation of TLR gene expression and TLR signaling, with a focus on the ability of miRNAs bind to TLRs.","['R01 CA222007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA096297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM122775/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA096300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6527596,,['NOTNLM'],"['*TLR', '*TLR ligands', '*Toll-like receptors', '*inflammation', '*microRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to their dynamic nature; MSC differentiate into various lineages that further constitute the niche which are required for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). A plethora of growth factors and cytokines secreted by MSC are essential for regulating the homeostasis within the niche in terms of cycling and quiescence of HSC. Additionally, there is a strong evidence suggesting the role of MSC in transformation of the niche to favour survival of leukemic cells. Regulation of HSC by MSC via BMP, Wnt, Notch and Sonic Hedgehog signalling has been well elaborated, however the modulation of MSC by HSC/LSC is yet unresolved. The cross talk between the HSC and MSC via paracrine or autocrine mechanisms is essential for the transformation. There are some reports implicating cell adhesion molecules, growth factors and cytokines; in modulation of MSC function and differentiation. The role of exosome mediated modulation has also been reported in the context of MSC transformation however, much needs to be done to understand this phenomenon in the present context. Similarly, the role of circulating nucleic acids, a well-studied molecular phenomenon in other tumours, requires attention in their potential role in crosstalk between MSC and HSC. This review underlines the current understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of MSC and its transformation in diseased state, laying stress on developing further understanding of MSC regulation for development of the latter as therapeutic targets.",,PMC6530176,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'HSC', 'Leukaemia', 'MSC', 'Stem cell niche']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6063-0811'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy resistance resulting from the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are found in numerous patients. Comparative transcriptome studies have been previously conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes between LSC(+) and LSC(-) cells. However, these studies mainly focused on a limited number of genes with the most obvious expression differences between the two cell types. We developed a computational approach incorporating several machine learning algorithms, including Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), incremental feature selection (IFS), support vector machine (SVM), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER), to identify gene expression features specific to LSCs. One thousand 0ne hudred fifty-nine features (genes) were first identified, which can be used to build the optimal SVM classifier for distinguishing LSC(+) and LSC(-) cells. Among these 1159 genes, the top 17 genes were identified as LSC-specific biomarkers. In addition, six classification rules were produced by RIPPER algorithm. The subsequent literature review on these features/genes and the classification rules and functional enrichment analyses of the 1159 features/genes confirmed the relevance of extracted genes and rules to the characteristics of LSCs.",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5664-7979'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), a main hydrolyzer of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in B cells, was shown to be involved in cell survival and drug resistance in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). However, the interrelationship between Myc and PDE4B remains unclear. Here, we first demonstrate the presence of the Myc-PDE4B feed-forward loop, in which Myc and PDE4B mutually reinforce the expression of each other. Next, the combined targeting of Myc and PDE4 synergistically prevented the proliferation and survival of B lymphoma cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. We finally recapitulated this combinatorial effect in Emu-myc transgenic mice; co-inhibition of Myc and PDE4 suppressed lymphomagenesis and restored B cell development to the wild type level that was associated with marked reduction in Myc levels, unveiling the critical role of the Myc-PDE4B amplification loop in the regulation of Myc expression and the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoma. These findings suggest that the disruption of the Myc-PDE4B circuitry can be exploited in the treatment of B cell malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor c-MYB functions as one such mediator in a diverse range of leukemias. Here we show for the first time that transcriptional repression of myeloid differentiation associated c-MYB target genes in AML is enforced by the AAA+ ATPase RUVBL2. Silencing RUVBL2 expression resulted in increased binding of c-MYB to these loci and their transcriptional activation. RUVBL2 inhibition resulted in AML cell apoptosis and severely impaired disease progression of established AML in engrafted mice. In contrast, such inhibition had little impact on normal hematopoietic progenitor differentiation.

We identified that 14-3-3epsilon induced expression of ZNF479, a novel potential transcriptional regulator by gene expression profiling and ZNF479 contributed to 14-3-3epsilon-suppressed MT-1 expression. ZNF479 induced the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex proteins (ASH2L and Menin), and increased tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3) levels, but suppressed H3K4 (H3K4me2) di-methylation. ZNF479-suppressed MT-1 expression was restored by silencing of ASH2L and DNMT1. Furthermore, ZNF479 expression was higher in HCC tissues than that in the non-cancerous tissues.

Multiple primaries-standardized incidence ratio (MP-SIR) was calculated to quantitate the risk of second primary malignancy (SPM). We further identified the risk factors of developing SPM and factors affecting overall survival (OS) in MA patients with SPM. Our results revealed that overall risk of SPM among MA patients was significantly higher than that in general population (SIR: 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1-1.18, P<0.05). Specific sites where the risk of SPM increased included salivary gland, bone and joints, soft tissue including heart, brain, cranial nerves other nervous system, thyroid, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Overall risk of SPM in patients aged </=29 and 30-59 years significantly increased (4.34- and 1.41-fold respectively). Whereas patients aged >/=60 years had a significantly decreased risk of SPM. Patients in the group of latency at 36-59, 60-119 and >/=120 months carried significantly increased overall risk of SPM. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, race, marital status, WHO grade, differentiated grade of cancer tissues, latency was independent predictor of OS in MA patients with SPM, which were all selected into the nomogram. The calibration curve for probability of survival showed good agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation.

Epub 2019 May 28.,"Antigen-directed immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are associated with severe toxicities due to the lack of unique targetable antigens that can distinguish leukemic cells from normal myeloid cells or myeloid progenitors. Here, we present an approach to treat AML by targeting the lineage-specific myeloid antigen CD33. Our approach combines CD33-targeted CAR-T cells, or the ADC Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin with the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells that have been engineered to ablate CD33 expression using genomic engineering methods. We show highly efficient genetic ablation of CD33 antigen using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in human stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and provide evidence that the deletion of CD33 in HSPC doesn't impair their ability to engraft and to repopulate a functional multilineage hematopoietic system in vivo. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis revealed no detectable off-target mutagenesis and no loss of functional p53 pathways. Using a human AML cell line (HL-60), we modeled a postremission marrow with minimal residual disease and showed that the transplantation of CD33-ablated HSPCs with CD33-targeted immunotherapy leads to leukemia clearance, without myelosuppression, as demonstrated by the engraftment and recovery of multilineage descendants of CD33-ablated HSPCs. Our study thus contributes to the advancement of targeted immunotherapy and could be replicated in other malignancies.",['P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6575599,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD33', '*CRISPR/Cas9', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*transplantation']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4007-6769', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8251-7334']",['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Epub 2019 May 28.,"OBJECTIVES: Only a small number of studies have reported on the association of parental occupational exposure to benzene and risk of childhood and adolescent leukaemias. We examined associations with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in this population-based study in Denmark. METHODS: Benzene was largely banned from Danish workplaces after 1975, thus this case-control study focused on the immediately prior years. Paediatric cancer cases (<age 20) were ascertained from the Danish Cancer Registry among children born 1968-1974, and controls were selected from population records. Paternal occupation within the 3 months preconception and maternal pregnancy occupation were identified from nationwide pension fund records. Blinded, we assigned benzene exposure using a job-exposure matrix that had been developed for the Danish population. Risk for ALL was estimated using conditional logistic regression. In an exploratory analysis, we also examined other cancers with at least five case parents exposed. RESULTS: We identified 217 employed case fathers and 169 employed case mothers, of which 22 (10.1%) and 11 (6.5%), respectively, were exposed to benzene (vs 6.7% and 2.9% of control fathers and mothers). Most exposed parents worked as machine or engine mechanics, or in the shoe industry. Maternal occupational exposure to benzene in pregnancy was related to increased risk of ALL in offspring (adjusted OR=2.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.41), while paternal preconceptional benzene exposure was not as strongly associated (adjusted OR=1.40, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports an increased risk for ALL with parental occupational benzene exposure.","['R03 ES021643/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA175959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6693321,['NIHMS1035658'],['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*acute undifferentiated leukemia', '*astrocytoma', '*germ cell tumour', '*parental occupational exposure']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8713-8413'],"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We used anti-BAFF-R (VAY736), optimized for natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), to kill drug-resistant ALL cells. VAY736 antibody and NK cell treatments significantly decreased ALL disease burden and provided survival benefit in vivo However, if the disease was advanced, the ADCC efficacy of NK cells was inhibited by microenvironmental transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). Inhibiting TGFbeta signaling in NK cells using the TGFbeta receptor 1 (R1) inhibitor (EW-7197) significantly enhanced VAY736-induced NK cell-mediated ALL killing.

Until now, however, cancer optimal therapies have considered that malignancy exclusively depends on the drug concentration and the number of cancer cells, ignoring that the faster the cancer grows the worse the cancer is, and that early drug doses are more prejudicial. Here, we analyze how optimal therapies are affected when the time evolution of treated cancer is envisaged as an additional element determining malignancy, analyzing in detail the implications for imatinib-treated Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. METHODS: Taking as reference a mathematical model describing Chronic Myeloid Leukemia dynamics, we design an optimal therapy problem by modifying the usual malignancy objective function, unaware of any temporal dimension of cancer malignance. In particular, we introduce a time valuation factor capturing the increase of malignancy associated to the quick development of the disease and the persistent negative effects of initial drug doses. After assigning values to the parameters involved, we solve and simulate the model with and without the new time valuation factor, comparing the results for the drug doses and the evolution of the disease. RESULTS: Our computational simulations unequivocally show that the consideration of a time valuation factor capturing the higher malignancy associated with early growth of cancer and drug administration allows more efficient therapies to be designed. More specifically, when this time valuation factor is incorporated into the objective function, the optimal drug doses are lower, and do not involve medically relevant increases in the number of cancer cells or in the disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of our simulations and as biomedical evidence strongly suggests, the existence of a time valuation factor affecting malignancy in treated cancer cannot be ignored when designing cancer optimal therapies. Indeed, the consideration of a time valuation factor modulating malignancy results in significant gains of efficiency in the optimal therapy with relevant implications from the biomedical perspective, specially when designing patient-specific treatments.",['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6540446,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Imatinib therapy', '*Optimal control problem', '*System of difference equations', '*Time valuation factor']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4816-615X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current therapeutic methods have limited treatment effect on CML patients with drug resistance or disease relapse. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategy for CML is essential to be explored and the CRISPR RNA-guided FokI nucleases (RFNs) meet the merits of variable target sites and specificity of cleavage enabled its suitability for gene editing of CML. The RFNs provide us a new therapeutic direction to obliterate this disease. METHODS: Guide RNA (gRNA) expression plasmids were constructed by molecular cloning technique. The modification rate of RFNs on bcr-abl was detected via NotI restriction enzyme digestion and T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assay. The expression of BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling molecules were determined by western blotting. The effects of RFNs on cell proliferation and apoptosis of CML cell lines and CML stem/progenitor cells were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. In addition, murine xenograft model was adopted to evaluate the capacity of RFNs in attenuating the tumorigenic ability of bcr-abl. RESULTS: The RFNs efficiently disrupted bcr-abl and prematurely terminated its translation. The destruction of bcr-abl gene suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in CML lines and in CML stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, the RFNs significantly impaired the leukemogenic capacity of CML cells in xenograft model. CONCLUSION: These results illustrate that the RFNs can target to disrupt bcr-abl gene and may provide a new therapeutic option for CML patients affiliated by drug resistance or disease relapse.","['No.81500129/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No.81572060/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",PMC6537404,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-abl', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Homology-directed repair', 'Leukemogenesis', 'RNA guided-FokI nucleases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are a number of available drugs for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which are overcome by different sets of mutations. The main aim of this study was to explore if it can be possible to exploit this and create a treatment protocol that outperforms each drug on its own. METHODS: We present a computer program to test different treatment protocols against CML, based on available resistance mutation growth data. The evolution of a relatively stable pool of cancer stem cells is modelled as a stochastic process, with the growth of cells expressing a tumourigenic protein (here, Abl1) and any emerging mutants determined principally by the drugs used in the therapy. RESULTS: There can be some benefit to Bosutinib-Ponatinib rotation therapy even if the mutation status is unknown, whereas Imatinib-Nilotinib rotation is unlikely to improve the outcomes. Furthermore, an interplay between growth inhibition and selection effects generates a non-linear relationship between drug doses and the risk of developing resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Drug rotation therapy might be able to delay the onset of resistance in CML patients without costly ongoing observation of mutation status. Moreover, the simulations give credence to the suggestion that lower drug concentrations may achieve better results following major molecular response in CML.",['CAN 2015/387/Cancerfonden'],PMC6540367,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Drug rotation', 'Stochastic modelling', 'Targeted therapy', 'Treatment Simulation']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8696-3104'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard it has been shown that oxidative stress (OxS) and chronic inflammation are involved in the pathophysiology of these alterations. Harmless antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapeutic alternatives have been proposed, such as the consumption of Sechium edule (chayote), but the evidence is inconclusive. For this reason, an exploratory study of a single group chosen by convenience sampling, including 12 older adults, with an average age of 71 +/- 6 years (10 women and 2 men) with a diagnosis of MetS according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria. This exploratory study aimed to determine the effect of the consumption of the dried fruit powder supplement of Sechium edule var. nigrum spinosum (500 mg, 3 times per day) for six weeks on the markers of OxS in elderly adults with MetS. All participants' OxS markers were measured before and after treatment. There was a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of lipoperoxides (baseline, 0.289 +/- 0.04 vs. post-treatment, 0.234 +/- 0.06 mumol/L, p < 0.05), together with a significant increase in total antioxidant status (baseline, 0.97 +/- 0.18 vs. post-treatment, 1.2 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, p < 0.05). In this sense, the oxidative stress index showed a statistically significant decrease (baseline, 1.7 +/- 0.78 vs. post-treatment, 0.75 +/- 0.87, p < 0.05). A statistically significant decrease in the concentration of TNF-alpha after treatment was also found (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.4 vs. post-treatment, 3.5 +/- 1.3, p < 0.05).Our findings suggest that the consumption of the dry fruit of Sechium edule has an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect in older adults with metabolic syndrome.",,PMC6562705,,['NOTNLM'],"['Sechium edule', 'chayote', 'inflammatory markers', 'metabolic syndrome', 'older adults', 'oxidative stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in human genetics have identified more than 30 ALS-causing genes or genetic loci that include the fused in sarcoma (FUS) gene. In addition, a set of studies suggested a mutual relationship between cancer and ALS. The hpo gene, Drosophila MST was newly identified as a novel genetic modifier of the cabeza (caz), Drosophila FUS. The Hippo pathway negatively regulates the control of organ growth and tumor suppression. Moreover, the p53 tumor suppressor was found to genetically interact with caz. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is characterized by the degeneration of neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes, and consists of a spectrum with ALS. Fusion protein nucleophosmin-human myeloid leukemia factor 1 (NPM-hMLF1), which is associated with the pathologies of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, was recently shown to suppress defects in the Drosophila FTLD model expressing the human FUS gene. Further studies in the field are expected to elucidate epidemiological, genetic, and histopathological links between cancer and ALS/FTLD, and will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies.

Biological activity of these phenolic compounds ranges from antioxidant, antitumor (terminaloside P, IC50 = 10 nM), anti-inflammatory, anti-neurodegenerative (schibitubin B, IC50 = 3.2 nM) and antiviral (patentiflorin A, IC50 = 14-23nM) to antimicrobial. In addition, it was observed that several members of this group, namely enterolactone and its biochemical precursors also known as phytoestrogens, possess important protective properties. Most of these lignans and neolignans are presented in reasonable amounts in one's diet and thus the protection they provide against the colon and breast cancer, to name a few, is even more important to note. Similarly, neuroprotective properties were observed (schisanwilsonin G, IC50 = 3.2 nM) These structural motives also serve as an important starting point in the development of anticancer drugs. Presumably the most famous members of this family, etoposide and teniposide, synthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin, are used in the clinical treatment of lymphocytic leukemia, certain brain tumors, and lung tumors already for nearly 20 years. This review describes 413 lignans and neolignans which have been isolated between 2016 and mid-2018 being reported in more than 300 peer-reviewed articles.

Epub 2019 May 25.,"Busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is often used to achieve target plasma exposures. Variability in busulfan plasma exposure units (BPEU) is a potential source for misinterpretation of publications and protocols and is a barrier to data capture by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) registry databases. We sought to harmonize to a single BPEU for international use. Using Delphi consensus methodology, iterative surveys were sent to an increasing number of relevant clinical stakeholders. In survey 1, 14 stakeholders were asked to identify ideal properties of a BPEU. In survey 2, 52 stakeholders were asked (1) to evaluate BPEU candidates according to ideal BPEU properties established by survey 1 and local position statements for TDM and (2) to identify potential facilitators and barriers to adoption of the harmonized BPEU. The most frequently used BPEU identified, in descending order, were area under the curve (AUC) in muMxmin, AUC in mgxh/L, concentration at steady state (Css) in ng/mL, AUC in muMxh, and AUC in mugxh/L. All respondents conceptually agreed on the ideal properties of a BPEU and to adopt a harmonized BPEU. Respondents were equally divided between selecting AUC in muMxmin versus mgxh/L for harmonization. AUC in mgxh/L was finally selected as the harmonized BPEU, because it satisfied most of the survey-determined ideal properties for the harmonized BPEU and is read easily understood in the clinical practice environment. Furthermore, 10 major professional societies have endorsed AUC in mgxh/L as the harmonized unit for reporting to HCT registry databases and for use in future protocols and publications.","['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD083211/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6755045,['NIHMS1530953'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Busulfan', '*Delphi process', '*Hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Precision medicine']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 25.,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of heterogeneous disorders caused by ineffective hematopoiesis and characterized by bone marrow dysplasia and cytopenia. Current treatment options for MDS are limited to supportive care, hypomethylating agents, and stem cell transplant. Most patients eventually succumb to the disease or progress to leukemia. Previously, we found that CD123 can be used to delineate MDS stem cells in patients at high risk for MDS and that the CD123-positive population is biologically distinct from normal hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, selective targeting of MDS stem cells can dramatically reduce tumor burden in preclinical models. On the basis of these findings, we propose CD123 as a candidate target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in high-risk MDS patients. To test this concept, we employed a CAR lentiviral vector containing a CD123-specific single-chain variable fragment in combination with the CD28 costimulatory domain, CD3zeta signaling domain, and truncated estimated glomerular filtration rate. Utilizing this system, we illustrate that CD123 CAR can be expressed on both healthy donor and MDS patient-derived T lymphocytes with high efficiency, leading to the successful elimination of MDS stem cells both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts. These results provide the concept for the use of CD123-targeted CAR T cells as a therapeutic option for patients with MDS.",['R01 CA200707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7184766,['NIHMS1565479'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2019 May 25.,"Cyclophosphamide (CPA) is a chemotherapeutic drug widely used in the treatment of breast cancer or leukemia in clinic. However, CPA was reported to have hepatotoxicity. This study aims to observe the engaged mechanism of CPA-induced liver injury in mice and the protection of liquiritin (LQ) and liquiritigenin (LG). Liver sinusoidal endothelial injury induced by CPA (20, 40mg/kg) in mice was evidenced by the elevated hepatic metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, and the results from liver histological evaluation and scanning electron microscope observation. CPA increased hepatic infiltration of neutrophils, liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) content, hepatic IL-6 mRNA expression, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) expression and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activation in mice. Elevated serum contents of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94) were found in mice treated with CPA. Liver sinusoidal endothelial injury and inflammation induced by CPA were diminished in TLR4 knock-out mice. LG and LQ (40, 80mg/kg) both ameliorated liver sinusoidal endothelial injury, and reduced the increased hepatic infiltration of neutrophils, MPO activity, hepatic IL-6 mRNA expression and NFkappaB activation induced by CPA. In summary, these results indicate that TLR4-NFkappaB-mediated inflammatory injury initiated by DAMPs was critically involved in CPA-induced hepatotoxicity. LG and LQ alleviated CPA-induced liver sinusoidal endothelial injury and inflammatory injury in mice.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclophosphamide', 'Inflammation', 'Liquiritigenin', 'Liquiritin', 'Liver sinusoidal endothelial injury']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 May 28.,"The limited application of immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be due to poor understanding of the global T cell immune dysfunction in AML. In this study, we analyzed the distribution characteristics of 24 TCR Vbeta subfamilies in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in AML patients and healthy controls. The percentage of TCR Vbeta subfamily T cells was predominately lower in most AML cases, while it was increased in some cases. TCR Vbeta2+T cells were increased in AML, particularly TCR Vbeta2+CD4+T cells, which were significantly higher. To further address the immunosuppression in different Vbeta subfamilies, we characterized the distribution of program death-1 (PD-1)+T cells in TCR Vbeta subfamilies of CD4+ and CD8+T cells. Significantly higher levels of PD-1+Vbeta+T cells were found for most Vbeta subfamilies in most AML cases. A higher percentage of PD-1+Vbeta2+T cells with a high number of Vbeta2+T cells was found in all of the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets. Moreover, increasing PD-1+Vbeta7.2, Vbeta8+, Vbeta14+, Vbeta16+, and Vbeta22+CD8+T cells were distributed in the AML-M5 subtype group compared with the AML-M3 group. In addition, higher PD-1+ Vbeta5.2+ and PD-1+ Vbeta12+CD8+T cells were associated with AML patients who had a poor response to chemotherapy. In conclusion, increased PD-1+Vbeta+T cells is a common characteristic of AML, higher PD-1+Vbeta2+T cells may be associated with a low antileukemia effect, and higher PD-1+Vbeta5.2+ and PD-1+Vbeta12+CD8+T cells may be related to poor prognosis in AML. These characteristics may be worth considering as immune biomarkers for clinical outcome in AML.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*TCR', '*immune checkpoint', '*immunosuppression']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4945-5914', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0974-4036']",['(c)2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most of them are asymptomatic, around 5% of infected individuals may develop either HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or Adult T-cell Leukaemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). Public Health authorities in many countries have implemented routine blood-donor tests for HTLV-specific antibodies; but this is not the case for Germany since the reported prevalence is very low (7/100,000). With the aim to evaluate retrospectively the presence of HTLV-1 among oncology patients in this country, samples stored at the Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, were analyzed. For this purpose, two different nested-PCR (n-PCR) protocols have been modified and set up for HTLV-1 detection. One positive case was detected by n-PCR among 406 samples (0,25%) in a period of 5 years (2008-2012) corresponding to a T-Cell Lymphoma. Despite the low prevalence, this virus is circulating in Germany, probably due to the increasing numbers of immigrants in these last years.

Most recently, several other compounds from this drug class have or are being investigated. Areas covered: The current paper reviews older and newer topoisomerase II inhibitors in clinical development for the treatment of AML. The authors discuss the clinical use of these agents, current trials involving them as well as their safety profile. Important side effects of these medications including therapy-related AML (t-AML) are also covered. Expert opinion: Topoisomerase II inhibitors have helped improve outcomes in AML. Recently, the FDA approved several agents including CPX-351 for the treatment of secondary and t-AML. CPX-351 may have applicability in other high-risk myeloid diseases.

Here we identify aberrant expressions of inflammatory IL-17B and its receptor (IL-17RB) in human and mouse mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged AML cells, which were further increased after exposure to chemotherapy. Interestingly, silencing of IL-17B or IL-17RB led to significant suppression of leukemic cell survival and disease progression in vivo. Moreover, the IL-17B-IL-17RB axis protected leukemic cells from chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptotic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-17B promoted AML cell survival by enhancing ERK, NF-kappaB phosphorylation, and the expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2, which were reversed by small-molecule inhibitors. Thus, the inhibition of the IL-17B-IL-17RB axis may be a valid strategy to enhance sensitivity and therapeutic benefit of AML chemotherapy.-Guo, H.-Z., Niu, L.-T., Qiang, W.-T., Chen, J., Wang, J., Yang, H., Zhang, W., Zhu, J., Yu, S.-H.

Information about the toxicity of chemotherapy and prognosis is largely derived from the experience of children with DS and ALL or children without DS. PROCEDURE: We describe the treatment and outcome of two unusual lymphoid malignancies in children with DS. One patient was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and the second, after treatment for B precursor ALL, with T-cell EBV-positive proliferative disorder (LPD). RESULTS: BL was treated with standard doses of LMB group B therapy subsequently intensified to group C therapy, including high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX, 3-8 g/m(2) ). The patient did not experience excessive toxicity and remains in complete remission 13 months later. Despite presentation with disseminated disease the patient with T-cell EBV-positive LPD after treatment for B precursor ALL responded to dexamethasone and rituximab and remains in complete remission two years later. CONCLUSIONS: Upfront reduction of the high treatment intensity, which is associated with excellent survival outcomes in BL, may not be warranted in all children with DS.

Epub 2019 Aug 8.,"AIM: To characterise unclassifiable sarcomas by use of a combined histological and molecular approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing, we identified in-frame fusions involving KMT2A (MLL) in two cases. Case 1 was a 20-year-old woman with a deep soft tissue mass in the thigh. The tumour consisted of monomorphic round, epithelioid and spindle cells in a highly sclerotic background that were focally immunopositive for CD34, CD31, and ERG. Case 2 was a 30-year-old woman with a tumour that affected the femur and surrounding soft tissue. The tumour consisted of monomorphic round to spindle cells that were immunopositive for BCOR, Wilms tumour 1, and NKX2-2. Both tumours were aggressive and had metastasised to the lung; both patients died within a few years. RNA sequencing identified a YAP1 (exon 5)-KMT2A (exon 4) fusion in case 1 and a VIM (exon 4)-KMT2A (exon 2) fusion in case 2, both of which were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. The fusion protein structure was different from that in acute leukaemia, suggesting a novel oncogenic mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: KMT2A fusions account for a subset of aggressive unclassifiable sarcomas in young adults. Although it is presently unclear whether these sarcomas belong to a single group, the well-established role of KMT2A fusions as drivers of acute leukaemia and a recent publication regarding identification of YAP1-KMT2A in one unclassifiable sarcoma support the significance of these fusions. Further studies on additional cases are necessary to fully understand the clinicopathological and molecular aspects of KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas.","['18K15108/JSPS KAKENHI', '18K07956/MEXT KAKENHI']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2A', 'VIM', 'YAP1', 'fusion', 'sarcoma']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3373-0099'],['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immunoediting and ensuing antigen loss remain the major obstacles to curative therapy in up to 25% of patients. For example, to achieve the CD19-negative phenotype, malignant cells can pick from a broad array of mechanisms, including focal loss-of-function mutations, dysregulated trafficking to the cell surface, alternative splicing, and lineage switching. In other cases, where resistance is mediated by insufficient antigen density, trogocytosis has been proposed as a possible underlying mechanism. To overcome these barriers, compensatory strategies will be needed, which could include using combinatorial CARs, harnessing epitope spreading, and targeting tumor neoantigens.","['T32 CA009615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA232563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6617517,['NIHMS1528278'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy makes use of T cells that have been modified to target a cancer-specific cell surface antigen. There is currently 1 Food and Drug Administration-approved CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory B-ALL with numerous other CAR T-cell products under clinical investigation. This review covers the development of CAR T cells for B-ALL, citing the remarkable efficacy of inducing remissions in a very high-risk population of patients. However, following the first round of CAR T-cell trials targeting CD19 in B-ALL, it has been found that approximately 50% of patients who initially respond will ultimately recur. Current efforts in the field are focusing on the identification of targets beyond CD19 as well as advancing strategies to promote more durable remissions as work is ongoing to move this therapy upfront.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crystalline structures are typically derived from kappa light chain immunoglobulins. The lesions of CSH are comprised of sheets of histiocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm containing variably prominent, elongated crystals. This rare phenomenon is important to recognize, as it is known to morphologically obscure an underlying neoplasm. Histologically, the cells of CSH may closely mimic Gaucher cells, as well as the ""pseudo-Gaucher"" cells sometimes encountered in chronic myeloid leukemia. The distinction between the cells of CSH and that of histologic mimics may be made more definitively through the use of electron microscopy, as the crystalline inclusions seen in CSH display characteristic size, shape, and localization within the cells. Here, we report 2 rare cases of CSH diagnosed by morphology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural examination.

However, the mechanism by which the liganded PML-RARalpha complex leads to the formation of the preinitiation complex has been unidentified. Here we demonstrate that the Mediator subunit MED1 plays an important role in the ATRA-dependent activation of the PML-RARalpha-bound promoter. Luciferase reporter assays showed that PML-RARalpha induced significant transcription at pharmacological doses (1 muM) of ATRA; however, this was submaximal and equivalent to the level of transcription driven by intact RARalpha at physiological doses (1 nM) of ATRA. Transcription depended upon the interaction of PML-RARalpha with the two LxxLL nuclear receptor recognition motifs of MED1, and LxxLL-->LxxAA mutations led to minimal transcription. Mechanistically, MED1 interacted ATRA-dependently with the RARalpha portion of PML-RARalpha through the two LxxLL motifs of MED1. These results suggest that PML-RARalpha initiates ATRA-induced transcription through its interaction with MED1.",['R01 DK071900/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6619921,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LxxLL nuclear receptor recognition motifs', '*MED1', '*Mediator', '*PML-RARalpha', '*transcriptional activation']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3865-8572'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although their population contributes only to approximately 1-6% of all leucocytes present in the human blood, they possess a wide range of specific functions. They play a key role in inflammation-regulating processes, when their numbers can increased to above 5 x 10(9) /l of peripheral blood. Their characteristic feature is the presence of granules containing eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), the release of which can trigger a cascade of events promoting oxidative stress, apoptosis or necrosis, leading finally to cell death. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to detect EPO, which comprises a chromophore protoporphyrin IX. Another cell structure associated with inflammation processes are lipid bodies (lipid-rich organelles), also well recognized and imaged using high resolution confocal Raman spectroscopy. In this work, eosinophils isolated from the blood of a human donor were analysed versus their model, EoL-1 human eosinophilic leukaemia cell line, by Raman spectroscopic imaging. We showed that EPO was present only in primary cells and not found in the cell line. Eosinophils were activated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which resulted in lipid bodies formation.

Traditionally, the ability to generate AML in immunocompromised mice were how these so-called LSCs were identified. Only those rare AML cells characterized by a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) CD34(+)CD38(-) phenotype were believed capable of generating leukemia in immunocompromised mice, but more recently, significant heterogeneity in the phenotypes of engrafting AML cells has been demonstrated. Moreover, AML cells that engraft immunocompromised mice do not necessarily represent either the founder clone or those cells responsible for relapse. A recent study found that the most immature phenotype present in an AML was heterogeneous, but correlated with genetically defined risk groups and outcomes. Patients with AML cells expressing a primitive HSC phenotype (CD34(+)CD38(-) with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity) manifested significantly lower complete remission rates, as well as poorer event-free and overall survivals. AMLs in which the most primitive cells displayed more mature phenotypes were associated with better outcomes. The strong clinical correlations suggest that the most immature phenotype detectable within a patient's AML might serve as a biomarker for ""clinically relevant"" LSCs. The minimal residual disease state during first remission may be the optimal setting to study novel LSC-targeted therapies, since they may have limited activity against the bulk leukemia and will be utilized at lowest tumor burden as well as least tumor heterogeneity.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'CD123', 'CD33', 'CD34', 'CD38', 'CLL-1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Leukemia stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 27.,"Although a few studies have been done on transmissible blood-borne viral infections in high-risk groups, little attention has been given to assessing the infection status of the general population in Afghanistan. To investigate the epidemiological status in the general population, we tested the serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infections. In total, 492 samples were selected randomly from Nangarhar, Herat, Mazar-e Sharif, Kandahar, and Kabul from subjects between 25 and 70 years old. The samples were tested for the presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HDV, anti-HCV, anti-HIV-1 and anti-HTLV I/II antibodies using chemiluminescent immunoassays on Abbott Architect automated platforms. In addition, 220 HBsAg-positive samples identified among 5897 samples from the general population of the same regions of Afghanistan were included in the study and tested for both HBsAg and anti-HDV to investigate HDV prevalence in the country. Viral loads of HBV, HCV and HDV were determined in all seropositive samples using Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan HBV, HCV, Test Roche (CA, USA), and an in-house method, respectively. Out of 492 samples, 31 (6.3%), 136 (27.6%) and 149 (30.3%) were found to be positive for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc, respectively. Anti-HDV positivity was detected in five (2.1%) out of 234 HBsAg-positive samples (including 14 of the randomly selected samples that were not among the 220 previously identified as HBsAg positive). Only eight out of 492 (1.6%) subjects were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Seven out of 489 (1.4%) were positive for anti-HIV-1 antibodies, and three out of 466 cases (0.6%) were positive for anti-HTLV I/II antibodies. These results suggest that Afghanistan is an intermediate endemic region for HBV, HDV and HCV infection. The prevalence of HIV-1 seems to be significantly higher than the global prevalence and that of the eastern Mediterranean region. In addition, the HTLV I/II screening results suggest that these viruses should be monitored in Afghanistan to confirm the trend observed in the current study.",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8861-7106'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 27.,"BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common finding and important cause of morbidity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis or during the course of its protracted treatment. We studied profile of anemia in ALL patients on maintenance therapy and evaluated specific micronutrients as cause of this anemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ALL patients who were on maintenance therapy and had grade >/= 2 anemia were recruited for the study. Serum iron studies, folate, and vitamin B12 were done to identify micronutrient deficiency and to initiate supplementation with specific components if found to be deficient. Toxicities, improvement of anemia, micronutrient levels, and disease outcome were studied after 3 months. RESULTS: From March 2015 to September 2016, 105 ALL patients were found to be on maintenance fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Overall, the proportion of anemia was 80%(N = 84). Majority had normocytic normochromic anemia (71%). Macrocytic anemia was seen in 18% and microcytic hypochromic in 9.5%. In patients with anemia of grade >/= 2 (N = 84), 38 patients (45%) had biochemical deficiency of serum folate, and 7 (8%) had vitamin B12 deficiency. No biochemical evidence of iron deficiency was found. Supplementation of deficient micronutrients improved anemia: mean hemoglobin significantly increased from 8.06 +/- 1.63 to 10.78 +/- 1.53 (p < 0.001) at 3 months; and reduced treatment toxicities, mean number of febrile neutropenia episodes (p = 0.007), and treatment interruptions of > 2 weeks (p = 0.002) were lowered. Patients with anemia had significantly more relapses (N = 14,64%) compared to patients without anemia (N = 8,36%), (p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: Timely identification and correction of micronutrient deficiencies causing anemia in ALL patients on maintenance can enhance treatment outcomes.","['JIP/Res/Intra-DM/M.Ch/first/01/2014/Jawaharlal Institute Of Postgraduate Medical', 'Education and Research', 'JIP/Res/Intra-DM/M.Ch/sec/02/2014/Jawaharlal Institute Of Postgraduate Medical', 'Education and Research']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Anemia', 'Folate', 'Iron', 'Micronutrient', 'Vitamin B12']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7275-7377'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 27.,"PURPOSE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare mature B cell leukemia. Purine analogs are the mainstay of treatment of HCL, but relapse after purine analog therapy is common. Outcomes of treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL typically diminish with each successive line of therapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk is a novel recombinant immunotoxin approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory HCL who have received at least two prior therapies, including a purine analog. This article reviews HCL treatment, focusing on moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk, its place in therapy, considerations for preparation and administration, and strategies for prevention and management of toxicities. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database from inception to January 2019, using the following terms: moxetumomab, hairy cell leukemia, relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia, immunotoxin, and CD22. The package insert and available posters and abstracts were also reviewed. RESULTS: FDA approval of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk was based on a phase III single-arm, open-label trial in 80 patients. Treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk yielded a durable complete response rate of 30% with a median duration of response that had not yet been reached at a median follow-up of 16.7 months. The objective response rate was 75% based on blinded independent central review. The most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reactions, edema, nausea, fatigue, headache, pyrexia and anemia. Serious adverse events include capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians providing care for patients receiving moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk should be aware of the strategies required for safe administration, including the management of serious adverse events.",,PMC6647181,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD22', '*Hairy cell leukemia', '*Immunotoxin', '*Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9335-9404', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1402-5554']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least 5-10 million individuals worldwide are currently living with HTLV-1. Studies of regional variation are required to better understand the contribution of MTCT to the global burden of infection. Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic approximately 10% develop high morbidity, high mortality disease. Infection early in life is associated with a higher risk of disease development. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), which is caused by HTLV-1 and has a median survival of 8 months is linked to MTCT, indeed evidence of ATL following infection as an adult is sparse. Infective dermatitis also only occurs following neonatal infection. Whilst HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) follows sexual and iatrogenic infection approximately 30% of patients presenting with HAM/TSP acquired the infection through their mothers. HAM/TSP is a disabling neurodegenerative disease that greatly impact patient's quality of life. To date there is no cure for HTLV-1 infection other than bone marrow transplantation for ATL nor any measure to prevent HTLV-1 associated diseases in an infected individual. In this context, prevention of MTCT is expected to contribute disproportionately to reducing both the incidence of HTLV-1 and the burden of HTLV-1 associated diseases. In order to successfully avoid HTLV-1 MTCT, it is important to understand all the variables involved in this route of infection. Questions remain regarding frequency and risk factors for in utero peri-partum transmission whilst little is known about the efficacy of pre-labor cesarean section to reduce these infections. Understanding the contribution of peripartum infection to the burden of disease will be important to gauge the risk-benefit of interventions in this area. Few studies have examined the impact of HTLV-1 infection on fertility or pregnancy outcomes nor the susceptibility of the mother to infection during pregnancy and lactation.

Epub 2019 May 27.,"The cross-talk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue has been identified to play a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and the development of hypertension. The role of different adipokines and myokines in hypertension and hypertension-related complications remains unclear. In the present study, 98 hypertensive patients and 24 normotensive controls were recruited, and additional subgroup analyses of hypertension-related complications were also performed. The levels of the circulating bone-derived factors leptin, apelin, fractalkine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), myostatin, fatty-acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3), irisin, follistatin-related protein 1 (FSTL1), oncostatin M, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and musclin were measured by a protein liquid chip assay. The circulating levels of BDNF and musclin were decreased, whereas the leptin and irisin levels were increased, in hypertensive patients compared with those in the control individuals. Further logistic analysis indicated that the irisin level was positively correlated with SBP and an independent predictor for hypertension after adjustment. In nonobese subjects, the concentrations of DKK1, BDNF and FSTL1 were decreased, whereas the concentrations of leptin and irisin were increased. Irisin and DKK1 might be associated with hypertension. Additional subgroup analyses showed that irisin is significantly associated with hypertension-related stroke. In conclusion, we found that increased irisin levels are associated with hypertension and hypertension-related stroke. These findings indicate that irisin may be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension.",,PMC8076012,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adipokines', '*Hypertension', '*Hypertension-related complications', '*Myokines']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Pediatric Oncology Ward, Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, Lahore, from January 2015 to July 2017. METHODOLOGY: Patients aged 1-15 years, diagnosed with ALL, were included. Studied variables were cytogenetic type and MRD outcome in patients with ALL. Patients under one year of age and more than 15 years, or those having comorbidities, were excluded. RESULTS: Total 150 patients' data were retrieved from the Hospital database. One hundred and thirty-three belonged to age 1 to 5 years group (89%) and 17 (11%) were in 5 to 10 years group. The mean age of the patient was 4.3 +3.1 years. One hundred and two (68%) were males; whereas, 48 (32%) were females. Pre B acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in 139 (93%) patients and 11(7%) were diagnosed with Pre T acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Standard risk was observed in 120 (80%) patients and 30 (20%) patients were on high risk as per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Guidelines. Regimen A was used in 125 (83.3%), Regimen B in 16 (10.7%), and Regimen C in 9 (6%) patients. BCR-ABL was positive in 2 (1.30%), TEL-AML in 68 (45%), MLL in 5 (3.30%), and normal in 54 (36%). MRD at day 29 was negative in 40 (93%) and positive in 3 (7%). The karyotyping was done in 128 (85%) patients, out of which 68 (53%) were hyperploids, 41 (32%) euploid, and 19 (15%) were hypoploid. Death was observed in 22 (15%) patients. Nineteen (86%) deaths were due to fungal and bacterial sepsis; and disease-related deaths were noted in 3 (14%) patients. CONCLUSION: The role of MRD and cytogenetics in risk assessment has improved in the early prognosis determination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 28;11(1):32. doi: 10.1186/s13073-019-0644-8.,"BACKGROUND: Somatic genetic testing is rapidly becoming the standard of care in many adult and pediatric cancers. Previously, the standard approach was single-gene or focused multigene testing, but many centers have moved towards broad-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. Here, we report the laboratory validation and clinical utility of a large cohort of clinical NGS somatic sequencing results in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a wide range of pediatric cancers. METHODS: Subjects were accrued retrospectively at a single pediatric quaternary-care hospital. Sequence analyses were performed on 367 pediatric cancer samples using custom-designed NGS panels over a 15-month period. Cases were profiled for mutations, copy number variations, and fusions identified through sequencing, and their clinical impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy was assessed. RESULTS: NGS panel testing was incorporated meaningfully into clinical care in 88.7% of leukemia/lymphomas, 90.6% of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and 62.6% of non-CNS solid tumors included in this cohort. A change in diagnosis as a result of testing occurred in 3.3% of cases. Additionally, 19.4% of all patients had variants requiring further evaluation for potential germline alteration. CONCLUSIONS: Use of somatic NGS panel testing resulted in a significant impact on clinical care, including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in 78.7% of pediatric patients tested in our institution. Somatic NGS tumor testing should be implemented as part of the routine diagnostic workup of newly diagnosed and relapsed pediatric cancer patients.","['K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6537185,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Molecular profiling', '*Pediatric cancer', '*Tumor sequencing']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4253-2369'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are in evaluation as therapeutic agents for cancer. RITs based on Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) are in use clinically for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, and under trial for the treatment of other cancers. In an effort to improve the efficacy of PE-based RITs, we evaluated the potential of combination therapy with several common antibiotics (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, linezolid, fusidic acid, and kanamycin) on human cell lines HEK293, OVCAR8, and CA46. Antibiotics were selected based on their potential to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis and disrupt energy metabolism in cancer cells. RESULTS: Tetracycline, chloramphenicol, linezolid, and fusidic acid alone killed cultured human cells at high concentrations. At high but nontoxic concentrations of each antibiotic, only chloramphenicol treatment of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line CA46 showed enhanced cytotoxicity when paired with an anti-transferrin receptor/PE RIT.

The cytoplasmic adaptor CRKL (v-crk avian sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like) is a CRK like proto-oncogene, which encodes a SH2 and SH3 (src homology) domain-containing adaptor protein. CRKL is tightly linked to leukemia via its binding partners BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL, upregulated in multiple types of human cancers, and induce cancer cell proliferation and invasion. However, it remains unclear whether signaling adaptors such as CRKL could regulate alternative splicing. METHODS: We analyzed the expression level of CRKL in 305 cervical cancer tissue samples available in TCGA database, and then selected two groups of cancer samples with CRKL differentially expressed to analyzed potential CRKL-regulated alternative splicing events (ASEs). CRKL was knocked down by shRNA to further study CRKL-regulated alternative splicing and the activity of SR protein kinases in HeLa cells using RNA-Seq and Western blot techniques. We validated 43 CRKL-regulated ASEs detected by RNA-seq in HeLa cells, using RT-qPCR analysis of HeLa cell samples and using RNA-seq data of the two group of clinical cervical samples. RESULTS: The expression of CRKL was mostly up-regulated in stage I cervical cancer samples. Knock-down of CRKL led to a reduced cell proliferation. CRKL-regulated alternative splicing of a large number of genes were enriched in cancer-related functional pathways, among which DNA repair and G2/M mitotic cell cycle, GnRH signaling were shared among the top 10 enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways by results from clinical samples and HeLa cell model. We showed that CRKL-regulated ASEs revealed by computational analysis using ABLas software in HeLa cell were highly validated by RT-qPCR, and also validated by cervical cancer clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of CRKL-regulation of the alternative splicing of a number of genes critical in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, which is consistent with CRKL reported role as a signaling adaptor and a kinase. Our results underline that the signaling adaptor CRKL might integrate the external and intrinsic cellular signals and coordinate the dynamic activation of cellular signaling pathways including alternative splicing regulation.",['No. 2013M542581/China Postdoctoral Science Foundation'],PMC6537309,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alternative splicing', 'CRKL', 'Cervical carcinoma', 'RNA-seq', 'Tumorigenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 2.,"BACKGROUND: Cucurbitacin E (CuE) is an oxygenated tetracyclic triterpenoid isolated from the fruits of Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad. PURPOSE: This study outlines CuE's cytotoxic activity against drug-resistant tumor cell lines. Three members of ABC transporters superfamily, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and ABCB5 were investigated, whose overexpression in tumors is tightly linked to multidrug resistance. Further factors of drug resistance studied were the tumor suppressor TP53 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays (resazurin assays) were used to investigate the activity of Citrullus colocynthis and CuE towards multidrug resistant cancer cells. Molecular docking (In silico) has been carried out to explore the CuE's mode of binding to ABC transporters (P-gp, BCRP and ABCB5). The visualization of doxorubicin uptake was done by a Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope. The assessment of proteins expression was done by western blotting analysis. COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to identify, which genes correlate with sensitivity or resistance to cucurbitacins (CuA, CuB, CuE, CuD, CuI, and CuK). RESULTS: Multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing P-gp or BCRP were cross-resistant to CuE. By contrast, TP53 knock-out cells were sensitive to CuE. Remarkably, resistant cells transfected with oncogenic DeltaEGFR or ABCB5 were hypersensitive (collateral sensitive) to CuE. In silico analyses demonstrated that CuE is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Immunoblot analyses highlighted that CuE targeted EGFR and silenced its downstream signaling cascades. The most striking result that emerged from the doxorubicin uptake by ABCB5 overexpressing cells is that CuE is an effective inhibitor for ABCB5 transporter when compared with verapamil. The COMPARE analyses of transcriptome-wide expression profiles of tumor cell lines of the NCI identified common genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cellular adhesion and intracellular communication for different cucurbitacins. CONCLUSION: CuE represents a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of certain types of refractory tumors. To best of our knowledge, this is the first time to identify CuE and verapamil as inhibitors for ABCB5 transporter.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Citrullus colocynthis', 'Drug resistance', 'Microarray', 'Traditional herbal medicine']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2019 May 25.,"Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignant disorder. Intensive conventional chemotherapy regimens and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have failed to improve outcomes in ATLL. Allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) is commonly offered as front-line consolidation despite lack of randomized controlled trials. We performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane reviews on September 10, 2018. We extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (complete response [CR], overall survival [OS], and progression-free survival [PFS]) and harms (relapse and nonrelapse mortality [NRM]), independently by 2 authors. Our search strategy identified a total of 801 references. Nineteen studies (n=2446 patients) were included in the systematic review; however, only 18 studies (n=1767 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens were more commonly prescribed (52%). Bone marrow (50%) and peripheral blood (40%) were more frequently used as stem cell source. The pooled post-allografting CR, OS, and PFS rates were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57% to 87%), 40% (95% CI, 33% to 46%), and 37% (95% CI, 27% to 48%), respectively. Pooled relapse and NRM rates were 36% (95% CI, 28% to 43%) and 29% (95% CI, 21% to 37%), respectively. The heterogeneity among the included studies was generally high. These results support the use of allo-HCT as an effective treatment for patients with ATLL, yielding pooled OS rates of 40%, but relapse still occurs in over one-third of cases. Future studies should evaluate strategies to help reduce relapse in patients with ATLL undergoing allo-HCT.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*HTLV-1-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)', '*Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Jun 22.,"The role of proNGF, the precursor of nerve growth factor (NGF), in the biology of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) is still unclear. Here, we analyzed adult hippocampal neurogenesis in AD11 transgenic mice, in which the constitutive expression of anti-NGF antibody leads to an imbalance of proNGF over mature NGF. We found increased proliferation of progenitors but a reduced neurogenesis in the AD11 dentate gyrus (DG)-hippocampus (HP). Also in vitro, AD11 hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferated more, but were unable to differentiate into morphologically mature neurons. By treating wild-type hippocampal progenitors with the uncleavable form of proNGF (proNGF-KR), we demonstrated that proNGF acts as mitogen on aNSCs at low concentration. The mitogenic effect of proNGF was specifically addressed to the radial glia-like (RGL) stem cells through the induction of cyclin D1 expression. These cells express high levels of p75(NTR) , as demonstrated by immunofluorescence analyses performed ex vivo on RGL cells isolated from freshly dissociated HP-DG or selected in vitro from NSCs by leukemia inhibitory factor. Clonogenic assay performed in the absence of mitogens showed that RGLs respond to proNGF-KR by reactivating their proliferation and thus leading to neurospheres formation. The mitogenic effect of proNGF was further exploited in the expansion of mouse-induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Chronic exposure of iNSCs to proNGF-KR increased their proliferation. Altogether, we demonstrated that proNGF acts as mitogen on hippocampal and iNSCs.

METHODS: We prospectively monitored MRD after induction and consolidation therapy in adult patients with Ph-negative ALL. RESULTS: Among 103 adult ALL patients enrolled, 59 were Ph-negative, and MRD status was assessed in 51 patients. The probability of 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 69% (95%CI 54-80) and 50% (95%CI 36-63), respectively. Patients who were MRD-negative after induction therapy (n = 15) had a significantly better 3-year DFS compared with those who were MRD-positive (n = 30; 73% vs 41%, P = 0.018). Patients who were MRD-positive after induction but became MRD-negative after consolidation chemotherapy C in the first course (n = 11) showed a significantly worse 3-year DFS compared with patients who were MRD-negative after induction chemotherapy A in the first course (45% vs 73%, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DFS of about 70% can be expected in MRD-negative patients after induction therapy, and the patients did not benefit from HSCT in 1CR.

Populations living around mine tailings of the Witwatersrand goldfields may be exposed through various pathways, raising concern about potential health risks associated with haematological malignancies (HMs), for which evidence is inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: We designed a prospective case-series study of HMs at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH), Johannesburg, the major public hospital in the area, to describe demographic and clinical characteristics, lifetime residential history and potential environmental uranium exposure pathways. METHODS: All patients, male and female, aged >/=18 years and newly diagnosed with any form of leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma at the CHBAH Haematology Unit in 2014 and 2015 were considered for inclusion in the study. Information on uranium exposure pathways and lifetime residential history was recorded from interviewer-administered questionnaires. These characteristics were described overall and according to subtypes of HM. RESULTS: Of 556 patients with HMs diagnosed in 2014 and 2015 at CHBAH, 189 patients aged 18 - 90 years were interviewed, mainly with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (37.6%), leukaemia (32.8%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (13.8%). HIV status was positive for 39.2% of the patients, mostly with NHL and HL. Potential environmental uranium exposure pathways were identified. Working on goldmines was reported by 12 patients (6.3%). Consumption of soil (geophagia) was a habit of 51 patients (27.0%), particularly during pregnancy. Drinking water was mainly piped water (76.6% in childhood and 97.9% in adulthood). Animal products and vegetables were most frequently obtained from stores (82.0% and 68.7%, respectively, in childhood and 96.3% and 83.6% in adulthood). Patients were referred to CHBAH by government clinic doctors (44.4%), referral hospitals (24.3%) and private doctors (20.1%). Most participants had been born and lived in Gauteng Province and Soweto (94.7% and 58.2%, respectively), and reported two lifetime places of residence on average and living at their current residence for >/=20 years (49.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We identified potential environmental uranium exposure pathways (occupational, lifestyle related and domestic) among patients with HMs that could have resulted in increased uranium exposure. HIV is common among patients with HMs. Together with the results from a previous retrospective case series of HMs at CHBAH (2004 - 2013), our findings suggest that further research on environmental uranium exposure in mining areas and HM risk in residents is warranted.",['001/World Health Organization/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 27.,"Objective: Significant developments occurred in the clinical management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults in recent decades. However, treatment results are still not satisfactory, especially in routine practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the general clinical features, treatment details, and outcomes of a large group of patients followed in multiple centers in Turkey with a diagnosis of ALL. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the data of patients with ALL was made, the patients having been diagnosed and treated between January 2003 and June 2017 by different protocols in the hematology clinics of ten different centers. A total of 288 patients, aged between 17 and 76 years old, were included in the study. In this retrospective multicenter analysis of patients with ALL, classification of patients was performed based on treatment period, Philadelphia chromosome positivity, treatment regimen, and administration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Results: The majority of cases were B-cell in origin, while 224 patients had B-ALL and 64 of the patients had T-ALL. Median follow-up duration for all patients was 18.2 months (range: 0.03-161 months). Philadelphia chromosome positivity was determined in 49 patients (21.9%), and 54 patients (18.8%) were receiving allo-HSCT. After induction chemotherapy, 219 patients (76.0%) achieved complete remission, 32 patients (11.2%) were evaluated as treatment refractory, and 37 patients (12.8%) were deceased.

Epub 2019 May 26.,"BACKGROUND: The confirmation of clinical diagnosis, molecular remission, and sequential minimal residual disease monitoring required PML-RARalpha detection in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The current status of PML-RARalpha detection in various laboratories remains unknown. METHODS: In 2018, external quality assessment (EQA) for PML-RARalpha detection was carried out in China. Three EQA sample panels for PML-RARalpha isoform L/S/V were prepared by different mock leukocyte samples. The performances of PML-RARalpha detection, including admission screening, and qualitative and quantitative detection by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), were assessed based on APL simulated clinical case. RESULTS: The mock leukocyte samples met the requirements of a clinically qualified sample for PML-RARalpha EQA panel. Among the laboratories, 13/50 (26.0%) were ""competent,"" 21/50 (42%) classified as ""acceptable,"" and 16/50 (32.0%) classified as ""improvable."" One (1/50, 2.0%) laboratory reported one screening mistake. Twenty-six (26/50, 52.0%) laboratories reported 29 false-positive and 19 false-negative results. Twenty-three (23/50, 46.0%) laboratories reported 42 quantitative incorrect results. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were not found in PML-RARalpha detection performance among laboratories that used different extraction methods. The performances of qualitative and quantitative RT-qPCR detection were worse accurate for PML-RARalpha isoform V. Quantitative variation was higher for low-level samples. Further continuous external assessment and education are needed in the management of PML-RARalpha detection.","['81601848/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '201402018/the Special Fund for Health Scientific Research in the Public Interest', ""from National Population and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic"", 'of China', '7174345/Beijing Natural Science Foundation']",PMC6642306,,['NOTNLM'],"['PML-RARalpha', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'external quality assessment', 'real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0700-3848', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0253-8651']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The main toxicity includes delayed immune reconstitution, subsequent viral reactivations, and leukemia relapse. Exposure to alemtuzumab is highly variable upon empirical milligram/kilogram dosing. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for alemtuzumab was developed based on a total of 1146 concentration samples from 206 patients, aged 0.2-19 years, receiving a cumulative intravenous dose of 0.2-1.5 mg/kg, and treated between 2003 and 2015 in two centers. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab PK were best described using a two-compartment model with a parallel saturable and linear elimination pathway. The linear clearance pathway, central volume of distribution, and intercompartmental distribution increased with body weight. Blood lymphocyte counts, a potential substrate for alemtuzumab, did not impact clearance. CONCLUSION: The current practice with uniform milligram/kilogram doses leads to highly variable exposures in children due to the non-linear relationship between body weight and alemtuzumab PK. This model may be used for individualized dosing of alemtuzumab.",,PMC6885503,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1512-2791'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, TLR2 represents an attractive cancer immunotherapeutic target. Here, a synthetic library of 14 000 compounds together with a series of newly developed compounds for NF-kappaB activation using HEK-Blue hTLR2 cells is initially screened. Following further screening in a variety of cells including HEK-Blue hTLRs reporter cells, murine, and human macrophage cell lines, a potent small molecule agonist 23 (SMU-Z1) is identified, which specifically activates TLR2 through its association with TLR1, with a EC50 of 4.88 +/- 0.79 x 10(-9) m. Toxicology studies, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and nitric oxide) and target-protein based biophysical assays demonstrate the pharmacologically relevant characteristics of SMU-Z1. In addition, SMU-Z1 promotes murine splenocyte proliferation and upregulates the expression of CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and DCs, which results in a significant antitumor effect in a murine leukemia model. Finally, the induced tumors in three out of seven mice disappear after administration of SMU-Z1. Our studies thus identify a novel and potent TLR1/2 small molecule agonist, which displays promising immune adjuvant properties and antitumor immunity.",,PMC6523386,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD8+ T', 'Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)', 'agonist', 'leukemia', 'tumor immunity']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4136-2070'],,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a novel technology, which has been widely applied in biomedicine, especially in various of cancer treatment. However, the changes in cell metabolism after CAP treatment of leukemia cells have been rarely studied. Methods: In this study, we investigated the metabolite profiling of plasma treatment on leukemia cells based on Gas Chromatography Tandem Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). Simultaneously, we conducted a series of bioinformatics analysis of metabolites and metabolic pathways with significant differences after basic data analysis. Results: 800 signals were detected by GC-TOF mass-spectrometry and then evaluated using PCA and OPLS-DA. All the differential metabolites were listed and the related metabolic pathways were analyzed by KEGG pathway. The results showed that alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism had a significant change after plasma treatment. Meanwhile, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism were significantly changed by CAP. Glutaminase activity was decreased after plasma treatment, which might lead to glutamine accumulation and leukemia cells death. Conclusions: We found the above two metabolic pathways vulnerable to plasma treatment, which might result in leukemia cells death and might be the cornerstone of further exploration of plasma treatment targets.",,PMC6525389,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism', 'Cold atmospheric plasma', 'Metabolite profiling', 'd-Glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism']",,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulation of SATB1 is linked with progression of tumors. Our previous study showed that SATB1 expression was decreased in T cell leukemia/lymphoma. The contrary roles of SATB1 in solid organ tumors and hematology malignancy may provide hints to study the function of SATB1. Methods: To characterize SATB1 mRNA and protein expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot on bone marrow mononuclear cells from 52 newly diagnosed AML patients. Stable HL-60 cell lines with knockdown of SATB1 by shRNAs sequences (HL-60 SATB1-shRNA1 and HL-60 SATB1-shRNA2) were established. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell invasiveness were analyzed. Murine model was established using HL-60 SATB1-shRNAs treated nude mice and tumorigenicity was compared to study the role of SATB1 in vivo. Global gene expression profiles were analyzed in HL-60 cells with SATB1 knockdown to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of AML cell growth by SATB1. Results: We found that SATB1 expression was significantly decreased in patients with AML compared to normal control, and was increased after complete remission of AML. Knockdown of SATB1 enhanced the proliferation of HL-60 cells and accelerated S phase entry in vitro, and promoted the tumor growth in vivo. Global gene expression profiles were analyzed in HL-60 cells with SATB1 knockdown and the differentially expressed genes were involved in NF-kappaB, MAPK and PI3 K/Akt signaling pathways. Nuclear NF-kappaB p65 levels were significantly increased in SATB1 depleted HL-60 cells. Conclusions: Decreased SATB1 expression promotes AML cell proliferation through NF-kappaB activation.

This study outlines a simplified approach to identify lead compounds from natural products against several cancer cell lines, and provides the basis to better understand structure activity relationship of the natural product cephalotaxine. Using high-throughput screening, a natural product library containing fractions and pure compounds was interrogated for proliferation inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cellular models (SUP-B15 and KOPN-8). Initial hits were verified in control and counter screens, and those with EC50 values ranging from nanomolar to low micromolar were further characterized via mass spectrometry, NMR, and cytotoxicity measurements. Most of the active compounds were alkaloid natural products including cephalotaxine and homoharringtonine, which were validated as protein synthesis inhibitors with significant potency against several cancer cell lines. A generated BODIPY-cephalotaxine probe provides insight into the mode of action of cephalotaxine and further rationale for its weaker potency when compared to homoharringtonine. The steroidal natural products (ecdysone and muristerone A) also showed modest biological activity and protein synthesis inhibition. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that natural products continue to provide insight into structure and function of molecules with therapeutic potential against drug resistant cancer cell models.","['ALSAC/American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities', 'P30CA021765/National Cancer Institute']",PMC6571673,,['NOTNLM'],"['antiproliferation agents', 'cancer', 'cephalotaxine', 'natural product alkaloids', 'protein synthesis inhibition']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3643-2035'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Stroma is a poorly defined non-parenchymal component of virtually every organ with key roles in organ development, homeostasis, and repair. Studies of the bone marrow stroma have defined individual populations in the stem cell niche regulating hematopoietic regeneration and capable of initiating leukemia. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define a cellular taxonomy of the mouse bone marrow stroma and its perturbation by malignancy. We identified seventeen stromal subsets expressing distinct hematopoietic regulatory genes spanning new fibroblastic and osteoblastic subpopulations including distinct osteoblast differentiation trajectories. Emerging acute myeloid leukemia impaired mesenchymal osteogenic differentiation and reduced regulatory molecules necessary for normal hematopoiesis. These data suggest that tissue stroma responds to malignant cells by disadvantaging normal parenchymal cells. Our taxonomy of the stromal compartment provides a comprehensive bone marrow cell census and experimental support for cancer cell crosstalk with specific stromal elements to impair normal tissue function and thereby enable emergent cancer.","['R01 DK107784/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RM1 HG006193/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC6570562,['NIHMS1529101'],['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow niche', '*hematopoiesis', '*leukemia', '*single-cell RNA-sequencing', '*stem cell', '*stroma', '*tumor microenvironment']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 6.,"BACKGROUND: Modern automated hematology analyzers provide quantitative data on leukocyte size and structure that may be useful to distinguish reactive from neoplastic cellular proliferations. We compared leukocyte volume, conductivity and scatter (VCS) characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), bcr-abl1-positive patients with those of non-neoplastic neutrophilia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complete blood counts and VCS data (LH750 hematology analyzers, Beckman Coulter) from 38 newly-diagnosed CML patients, 65 CML on imatinib mesylate therapy, 58 patients with elevated age-specific neutrophil counts due to varied causes, 100 pregnant women and 99 healthy controls were collated and compared. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves, logistic regression models and classification trees were studied for their abilities to distinguish various groups. RESULTS: Untreated CML had higher mean neutrophil volume and mean monocyte volume (MNV and MMV), mean lymphocyte scatter (MLS) and higher standard deviations of the mean neutrophil volume and conductivity (MNV-SD and MNC-SD) over all other groups (p < 0.0001 for all). MNV, MNC-SD and MLS distinguished CML from reactive neutrophilia + pregnancy groups (sensitivities 89.5%, 94.7%, 94.7% and specificities 90.6%, 95.6% and 94.0% respectively). Combination of MNV>163.0 AND MNC-SD>12.69 was 89.5% sensitive and 100% specific for CML. Two algorithmic classification-tree approaches using VCS parameters alone (i.e. without the aid of blood count parameters) correctly separated 100% cases of untreated CML from all others. CONCLUSION: Successful distinction of untreated but not post-imatinib CML patients from subjects who were either normal, pregnant or had reactive neutrophilia by automated analyzer-derived cell-population data opens possibilities for their applications in diagnosing and understanding the pathogenesis of CML.",,PMC6541876,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Automated hematology analyzers', '*Cell population data', '*Cellular analysis', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Laboratory instrumentation', '*Neutrophilia']",,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Chang Gung University.

Epub 2019 May 11.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare, aggressive clonal myeloproliferative disorder of infancy and early childhood caused by oncogenic mutations in genes involved in the Ras pathway. Long-term survival has only been achieved with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), being able to cure more than 50% patients. To manage the disease before HSCT remains an important issue with constant searching for optimal treatment modalities. According to several retrospective analyses, azacitidine (AZA) induced clinical and molecular responses in patients with relapsed JMML pre-transplant and post-transplant, suggesting its use as a promising ""bridging"" therapy before HSCT. In this paper we report our first consecutive cohort of patients with JMML treated at our institution as well as our experience with the diagnosis, novel treatment and management of these patients before the HSCT. We present 6 patients with JMML, harboring different somatic mutations (PTPN11 and NRAS), with distinct clinical features; 3 of them had been treated with AZA 75 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle before the HSCT. Response to therapy was evaluated after each cycle in accordance with the International response criteria. One patient had a progression of splenomegaly during the treatment and after three cycles he was urgently transplanted. At the present, he is remaining in complete remission 3 years after HSCT. Two patients showed impressive response following the first cycle of the therapy with a regression of splenomegaly and monocyte count, normalized leukocytes, platelets and absent blasts in peripheral blood.

Epub 2019 May 25.,"A MEK1/2 inhibitor, binimetinib is promising as a therapeutic agent for malignant melanoma with N-RAS mutation. We examined in vitro effects of binimetinib on 10 human myeloid/lymphoid leukemia cell lines, and found that three of five cell lines with N-RAS mutation and one of five without N-RAS mutation were responsive to treatment with binimetinib. Binimetinib inhibited cell growth mainly by inducing G1 arrest and this action mechanism was assisted by gene set enrichment analysis. To identify signaling pathways associated with binimetinib response, we examined the status of MAP kinase/ERK and PI3Kinase/Akt pathways. The basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and Akt varied between the cell lines, and the amounts of phosphorylated ERK and Akt appeared to be reciprocal of each other. Interestingly, most of the binimetinib-resistant cell lines revealed strong Akt phosphorylation compared with binimetinib-sensitive ones. The effect of binimetinib may not be predicted by the presence/absence of N-RAS mutation, but rather by Akt phosphorylation status. Moreover, combination of binimetinib with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor showed additive growth-suppressive effects. These results suggest that binimetinib shows potential anti-leukemic effects and the basal level of phosphorylated Akt might serve as a biomarker predictive of therapeutic effect.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt phosphorylation', 'G1 arrest', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', 'N-RAS mutation']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0812-9816'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 30.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies provide conflicting evidence of a link between maternal substance use and risk of childhood cancer. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 785,438 newborns in Quebec (2006-2016). We identified infants whose mothers had problematic illicit drug, tobacco, or alcohol use before or during pregnancy. The primary outcomes were childhood hematopoietic cancer or solid tumors within 0-5 years of age. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we computed hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between maternal substance use and childhood cancer, adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 925 cases of cancer occurred during 3.5 million person-years of follow-up. Children exposed to any maternal substance use had marginally elevated cancer incidence rates compared with unexposed children (29.4 vs. 26.1 per 100,000 person-years). Maternal illicit drug use was associated with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR 1.63, 95% CI 0.79-3.36) and fibrosarcoma (HR 2.11, 95% CI 0.86-5.16). Maternal tobacco use was associated with acute myeloid leukemia (HR 2.01, 95% CI 0.72-5.60) and fibrosarcoma (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.05-4.32), but a weak association with neuroblastoma (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61-2.40) and renal tumors (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.42-3.13) also appeared to be present. CONCLUSIONS: We found a potential association between maternal substance use and certain types of early childhood cancer. Although effects were modest, maternal substance use may contribute to some types of childhood cancer, especially leukemia and fibrosarcoma.",['PJT-156062/CIHR/Canada'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood cancer', '*Maternal substance use', '*Pediatric cancer risk factors', '*Population-based cohort', '*Prenatal exposure']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 May 24.,"The improved success of HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in recent decades has had an impact on the indications for and timing of this treatment modality. In the absence of a matched sibling donor (MSD), historically MUD HSCT was reserved as an option after failure to respond to at least 2 courses of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in adults with SAA, but with improved outcomes over time, it is now considered following failure to respond to 1 course of IST. Recent national and international studies and guidelines now recommend upfront MUD HSCT as an option for children for whom an MUD is readily available, because outcomes are similar to those for MSD HSCT. Fludarabine-based conditioning and the use of in vivo T cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab has been associated with a reported overall survival (OS) of >85% in adult patients undergoing MUD HSCT. However, the recent introduction of eltrombopag for patients with SAA has transformed the treatment landscape, and there is currently much interest in its use with IST as upfront treatment, which showed a high response rate in an early-phase study. The risks of HSCT, especially graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), need to be carefully balanced against the concerns of IST, namely relapse and later clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In the absence of a current prospective randomized trial comparing these 2 approaches, in this review we examine the evidence supporting consideration of early MUD HSCT in adults with SAA who would have been considered for MSD HSCT but who lack a MSD and for whom an MUD is readily available, especially using an irradiation-free conditioning regimen, with a low risk of GVHD, as another treatment option. This option may be offered to patients to provide them with an informed choice, with the aim of curing disease rather than achieving freedom from disease, relapse-free survival, or OS. Furthermore, understanding the immune signature for the response to IST and the immunologic responses to somatic mutations and clonal progression to MDS/AML may help define the future indications for upfront HSCT and a more precise medical approach to therapy.",['CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Alemtuzumab', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Severe aplastic anemia']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

This study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of M. mipartitus snake venom and a new L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), named MipLAAO, on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on T-ALL cells (Jurkat), and its mechanism of action. PBL and Jurkat cells were treated with venom and MipLAAO, and morphological changes in the cell nucleus/DNA, mitochondrial membrane potential, levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and cellular apoptosis markers were determined by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and pharmacological inhibition. Venom and MipLAAO induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, but not in PBL, in a dose-response manner. Additionally, venom and MipLAAO increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensity, indicative of H2O2 production, increased DJ-1 Cys(106)-sulfonate, as a marker of intracellular stress and induced the up-regulation of PUMA, p53 and phosphorylation of c-JUN. Additionally, it increased the expression of apoptotic CASPASE-3. In conclusion, M. mipartitus venom and MipLAAO selectively induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells through a H2O2-mediated signaling pathway dependent mostly on CASPASE-3 pathway. Our findings support the potential use of M. mipartitus snake venom compounds as a potential treatment for T-ALL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Jurkat cells', 'L-amino acid oxidase', 'Micrurus mipartitus', 'Snake venom']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have described the disease burden in elderly AML patients, a population generally underrepresented in clinical trials. We aimed to characterize the comorbidities and complications in elderly AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/= 65 years with a primary diagnosis of AML were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database (2000-2013) and were followed until the end of 2014. AML patients were matched 1:1 to noncancer patients by age, sex, geographic region, and race. A subset of patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) AML was identified by modifying a previously validated algorithm. Baseline comorbidities and complications (eg, infectious, hematologic, cardiovascular) during follow-up were assessed using ICD-9 codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between AML and developing select complications. RESULTS: Compared to matched noncancer controls, AML patients (n = 3911) had higher baseline National Cancer Institute comorbidity index scores (1.81 vs. 1.63, P < .01), higher incidence rates (per 100 person-years) for all events of interest, and a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio = 4.61; 95% confidence interval, 4.07-5.21), type 2 diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio = 3.85; 95% confidence interval, 3.35-4.42), and stroke (hazard ratio = 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 2.32-2.92). R/R AML patients were younger, had lower National Cancer Institute comorbidity scores, lower incidence rates of events of interest, and a longer follow-up time compared to non-R/R AML patients. CONCLUSION: Elderly AML patients had more comorbidities and higher rates of complications compared to noncancer controls. Considering comorbidities and complications in elderly AML patients may improve clinical decision making.","['HHSN261201000140C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000034C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003862/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Disease burden', '*Older', '*Prognosis', '*Refractory', '*Relapsed']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Tumor suppressor protein p53 is important to the regulation of many cellular processes and the prevention of cancer development. In some cancer cells, the function of p53 is inhibited by murine double minute 2 protein (MDM2). To restore the function of p53, the inhibition or depletion of MDM2 has become a potential therapeutic treatment. We have successfully developed a series of small molecule MDM2 degraders that can promote the proteolysis of MDM2 oncoprotein, thus reactivating tumor suppressor p53. The superior degrader features a nutlin-based MDM2 ligand and a lenalidomide-based cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand with a short linker between the two ligands. At low nanomolar concentrations in RS4; 11 leukemia cells, this degrader promotes efficient degradation of MDM2. It also inhibits the proliferation of leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 3.2nM and induces apoptosis effectively. All of these data indicate that MDM2 degraders are promising therapeutics for the treatment of cancers, such as leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Degraders', 'Induced protein degradation', 'MDM2', 'PROTACs', 'p53']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We retrospectively reviewed charts of consecutive allo-HCT recipients who underwent transplantation in our center with the indication of acute leukemia (July 1990 to July 2018). Incidences of isolated EMR (iEMR) and bone marrow relapse (BMR) were calculated using cumulative incidence (CI) analysis, with each and treatment-related mortality considered a competing risk. We studied 554 allo-HCT recipients for 1.8 years (range, .04 to 27.75). Ten-year CI of 10.5% for iEMR was associated only with advanced disease phase at transplantation, whereas 10-year CI of 34.8% for BMR was independently associated with pretransplant disease phase, lines of treatment, and fungal infections. Most iEMR and BMR patients (75% and 81%, respectively) received systemic treatment combined with local radiation for iEMR (26%) and donor lymphocyte infusions (16% and 28%, respectively) when feasible. Extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was recorded in 47% of iEMR and 48% of BMR patients. Outcomes were poor both in iEMR (10-year overall survival [OS], 18.3%) and BMR (10-year OS, 19.1%). Independent predictors of OS were disease phase, type of donor, acute and chronic GVHD, fungal infections, iEMR, and BMR. In a large population with long-term follow-up, incidence of iEMR was relatively high, developed at the late post-transplant period, and was associated only with disease phase at transplantation. Furthermore, iEMR and BMR conferred similarly poor outcomes despite systemic treatment or extensive chronic GVHD.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Bone marrow relapse', '*Extramedullary relapse', '*Isolated extramedullary relapse']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 22.,"Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is an alternative treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who lack HLA-matched donors. Relapse after haplo-SCT remains a major concern, especially after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Promising results were reported for TBF-based conditioning regimens (thiotepa, busulfan, and fludarabine) in patients transplanted from different categories of donors and for various disease types but not specifically in PT-Cy haplo-SCT for AML. Here we evaluate the outcome of 100 AML patients who received haplo-SCT with PT-Cy after TBF conditioning regimens (reduced-intensity conditioning, n=77; myeloablative conditioning, n=23) in 2 transplant programs. Cumulative incidences of grades III to IV acute and moderate or severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 7% and 14%, respectively. NRM at 2 years was 28%, significantly influenced by disease status at haplo-SCT (first complete response [CR1] versus advanced AML: 16% versus 38%, P=.016) but not by conditioning intensity or age. The cumulative incidences of relapse at 2 years were 17% and 24% in CR1 and advanced AML, respectively (not significant). Progression-free survival, overall survival, and GVHD and relapse-free survival at 2 years were 67%, 71%, and 49% in CR1 patients, respectively, whereas comparative values in patients with advanced disease were 37%, 41%, and 32%. Our study suggests that TBF conditioning for PT-Cy haplo-SCT is safe and effective for AML patients in CR1. In patients with more advanced disease, the relatively low incidence of relapse seems counterbalanced by a high nonrelapse mortality, underlining the need for alternative strategies to decrease relapse risk, without increasing the intensity of conditioning regimen.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Haploidentical SCT', '*Thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 23.,"BACKGROUND: Myelopathy of the dorsal columns is a rare complication of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy that occurs most frequently with IT methotrexate and cytarabine. This diagnosis is made with a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, somatosensory evoked potentials, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, particularly myelin basic protein. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old man with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and known central nervous system involvement underwent standard treatment, including 5 doses of IT cytosine arabinoside. Following this, he had documented CSF clearance of disease. One year later, he developed progressive lower extremity weakness, numbness, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging and repeat CSF analysis demonstrated recurrence, and he underwent further IT administration of methotrexate and cytarabine. CSF clearance of malignant cells was again established. However, weakness progressed to quadriplegia; loss of bowel/bladder control; and severe sensory loss, particularly vibration and proprioception. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated high signal intensity in bilateral posterior columns. A lower thoracic spine dorsal column biopsy revealed cord destruction and diffuse macrophage infiltration with profound destruction of the neuropil. CONCLUSIONS: Although dorsal column myelopathy has previously been described in association with IT chemotherapy, this has solely been diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination, electrodiagnostic criteria, radiographic findings, and CSF analysis. This case provides a pathologic evaluation of an antemortem obtained specimen revealing diffuse macrophage infiltration and profound destruction of the neuropil. Whereas the mechanism underlying spinal cord toxicity following IT chemotherapy remains largely unknown, this case demonstrates a potentially macrophage-mediated process.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dorsal column myelopathy', 'Intrathecal chemotherapy', 'Neuro-oncology']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There are highly specific and safe synthetic ligands such as alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) and C20:2 which activate iNKT cells toward relatively Th1 and Th2 pathways, respectively. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation' (HSCT) is effective for leukemia and lymphoma through 'graft-versus-leukemia' (GVL) immunity. However, frequent serious complications include graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), opportunistic infections and relapse. Both GVHD and GVL are mediated by T cells.

For this purpose, five feature selection ranking methods including Bhattacharyya distance, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test, and Wilcoxon are used in the proposed topology of HMM. Here, we presented a strategy for constructing, learning and inferring the HMM for gene selection, which led to higher performance in cancer classification. In this experiment, three publicly available microarray datasets including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer and prostate were used for evaluation. Results demonstrated the higher performance of the proposed HMM-based gene selection against Markov chain rank aggregation and using individual feature selection criterion, where applied to general classifiers. In conclusion, the proposed approach is a powerful procedure for combining different feature selection methods, which can be used for more robust classification in real world applications.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer classification', '*DNA microarray', '*Feature selection', '*Hidden Markov model (HMM)', '*Multi-criteria ranking']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The KMT2A-D proteins are histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases embedded in large COMPASS-like complexes important for RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription. KMT2 mutations were initially associated with pediatric Mixed Lineage Leukemias (MLL) and found to be the result of rearrangements of the MLL1/KMT2A gene at 11q23. Over the past several years, large-scale tumor DNA sequencing studies have revealed the potential involvement of other KMT2 family genes, including heterozygous somatic mutations in the paralogous MLL3/KMT2C and MLL2(4)/KMT2D genes that are now among the most frequently associated with human cancer. Recent studies have provided a better understanding of the potential roles of disrupted KMT2C and KMT2D family proteins in cell growth aberrancy.

Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Khartoum state, Sudan, during the period from April 2017 to April 2018, involved 110 B-CLL patients and 80 healthy volunteers as a control group. Physical examination, Complete Blood Count and Immunophenotype were performed in all patients to confirm the diagnosis. Clinical staging such as Rai and Binet were studied. CD38 and ZAP70 were performed by Flow Cytometry. Blood samples were collected from all participants; DNA was extracted by using ANALYTIKJENA Blood DNA Extraction Kit (Germany) and analyzed TP53 codon 72Arg/Pro Polymorphism by using AS-PCR. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). Results: the Arg/Pro was the most frequent genotype in B-CLL patients(50%), followed by Arg/Arg (25.5%) and Pro/Pro (24.5%), whereas in healthy control group Arg/Pro was the most frequent (47.5%), followed by Arg/Arg (45%) and Pro/Pro (7.5%). Our data indicate a higher frequency of homozygous Pro/ Pro in the B-CLL patients as compared to controls with an OR of 4.01 for the Pro/Pro genotype and lower frequency of Arg/Arg genotype in CLL patients as compared to controls with an OR of .42 for the Arg/Arg genotype. Also, the Pro allele showed higher risk than Arg allele (P value=0.000, OR 2.23, 95% CI=1.45-3.41). No significant association between gender, clinical staging systems (Rai, Binet), biological prognostic markers (CD38 expression or ZAP70 expression), and TP53 codon 72Arg/Pro polymorphisms, except Arg/Arg genotype tended to be associated with younger age (P =0.04).

A large number of pivotal biological processes are linked to leukemia pathogenesis. More insights into these mechanisms can provide a better developing pharmacological platform for patients with leukemia. Among the different players in leukemia pathogenesis, exosomes have appeared as a new biological vehicle, which can transfer oncogenic signals to blood cells. Exosomes are nano-carriers, which enable transferring numerous cargos such as DNA fragments, RNAs, messenger RNAs, microRNAs, long noncoding RNA, and proteins. Targeting the contents of exosomes leads to the alteration of host cell behavior. Increasing evidence has indicated that leukemia-derived exosomes could be utilized as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for individuals suffering from leukemia.

In leukemias, T regulatory cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), macrophages (MQs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) alter their functional and secretion patterns. Some of the changes in NK cells and classic MQ (M1) potentiate the immune responses against leukemia, but some Tregs changes will compromise the immune system. The effect of a cell on immunomodulation is in contrast to another cell, in which the cells are engaged in a competition so that a cell that having a higher effect on immunomodulation will be the contest winner. The outcome of immunomodulation in response to leukemia is determined by the ratio of stimulatory activity of NK cells and M1 to the inhibitory effect of Tregs, while the dual role of MSCs through immunomodulators and cytokines can be effective in weakening/enhancing the immune response.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia', 'Macrophages', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Natural killer cells', 'Tregs']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8494-5594'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this becomes challenging when cancer-derived DNA is in low abundance, such as in impure tissue specimens or in circulating cell-free DNA. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is particularly prone to technical artefacts that can limit the accuracy for calling low-allele-frequency mutations. State-of-the-art methods to improve detection of low-frequency mutations often employ unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for error suppression; however, these methods are highly inefficient as they depend on redundant sequencing to assemble consensus sequences. Here, we present a novel strategy to enhance the efficiency of UMI-based error suppression by retaining single reads (singletons) that can participate in consensus assembly. This 'Singleton Correction' methodology outperformed other UMI-based strategies in efficiency, leading to greater sensitivity with high specificity in a cell line dilution series. Significant benefits were seen with Singleton Correction at sequencing depths </=16 000x. We validated the utility and generalizability of this approach in a cohort of >300 individuals whose peripheral blood DNA was subjected to hybrid capture sequencing at approximately 5000x depth.

CTCF is essential to define topologically associated domain boundaries and to facilitate the formation of insulated chromatin loop structures. To understand CTCF's direct role in global transcriptional regulation, we integrated the miniAID-mClover3 cassette to the endogenous CTCF locus in a human pediatric B-ALL cell line, SEM, and an immortal erythroid precursor cell line, HUDEP-2, to allow for acute depletion of CTCF protein by the auxin-inducible degron system. In SEM cells, CTCF loss notably disrupted intra-TAD loops and TAD integrity in concurrence with a reduction in CTCF-binding affinity, while showing no perturbation to nuclear compartment integrity. Strikingly, the overall effect of CTCF's loss on transcription was minimal. Whole transcriptome analysis showed hundreds of genes differentially expressed in CTCF-depleted cells, among which MYC and a number of MYC target genes were specifically downregulated. Mechanically, acute depletion of CTCF disrupted the direct interaction between the MYC promoter and its distal enhancer cluster residing approximately 1.8 Mb downstream. Notably, MYC expression was not profoundly affected upon CTCF loss in HUDEP-2 cells suggesting that CTCF could play a B-ALL cell line specific role in maintaining MYC expression.",,PMC6648894,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Epub 2019 May 24.,"Imipridones constitute a novel class of antitumor agents. Here, we report that a second-generation imipridone, ONC212, possesses highly increased antitumor activity compared to the first-generation compound ONC201. In vitro studies using human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary AML, and normal bone marrow (BM) samples demonstrate that ONC212 exerts prominent apoptogenic effects in AML, but not in normal BM cells, suggesting potential clinical utility. Imipridones putatively engage G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and/or trigger an integrated stress response in hematopoietic tumor cells. Comprehensive GPCR screening identified ONC212 as activator of an orphan GPCR GPR132 and Galphaq signaling, which functions as a tumor suppressor. Heterozygous knock-out of GPR132 decreased the antileukemic effects of ONC212. ONC212 induced apoptogenic effects through the induction of an integrated stress response, and reduced MCL-1 expression, a known resistance factor for BCL-2 inhibition by ABT-199. Oral administration of ONC212 inhibited AML growth in vivo and improved overall survival in xenografted mice. Moreover, ONC212 abrogated the engraftment capacity of patient-derived AML cells in an NSG PDX model, suggesting potential eradication of AML initiating cells, and was highly synergistic in combination with ABT-199. Collectively, our results suggest ONC212 as a novel therapeutic agent for AML.","['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '102696/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC6874902,['NIHMS1526661'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell is commonly termed the CML leukemia stem cell (LSC). In humans a CML LSC is operationally-defined by >/=1 in vitro or in vivo assays of human leukemia cells transferred to immune-deficient mice. Results of these assays are sometimes discordant. There is also the unproved assumption that biological features of a CML LSC are stable. These considerations make accurate and precise identification of a CML LSC difficult or impossible. In this review, we consider biological features of CML LSCs defined by these assays. We also consider whether CML LSCs are susceptible to targeting by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other drugs, and whether elimination of CML LSCs is needed to achieve therapy-free remission or cure CML.",,PMC6755964,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6954-969X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFR-AS1), a novel cancer-related lncRNA, has been reported to be under-expressed in breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis. However, the exact role of LIFR-AS1 in breast cancer remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the biological role of LIFR-AS1 in breast cancer and clarify the potential molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we found that LIFR-AS1 was significantly down-regulated in both tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, over-expression of LIFR-AS1 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of LIFR-AS1 promoted breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Moreover, LIFR-AS1 was observed to up-regulate suppressor of fused gene (Sufu) expression by competitively binding to miR-197-3p in breast cancer cells. Notably, miR-197-3p inhibitor reversed the promoting effects of LIFR-AS1 knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Additionally, LIFR-AS1 knockdown promoted tumor growth in vivo To sum up, our results imply the tumor-suppressing role of LIFR-AS1 in breast cancer.",,PMC6614576,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LIFR-AS1', '*Sufu', '*breast cancer', '*cell migration', '*miR-197-3p']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3537-0525'],['(c) 2019 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying patients at high-risk of EMR failure at diagnosis provides an opportunity to intensify frontline therapy and potentially avoid EMR failure. We studied blood samples from 96 CP-CML patients at diagnosis and identified 365 genes that were aberrantly expressed in 13 patients who subsequently failed to achieve EMR, with a gene signature significantly enriched for stem cell phenotype (eg, Myc, beta-catenin, Hoxa9/Meis1), cell cycle, and reduced immune response pathways. We selected a 17-gene panel to predict EMR failure and validated this signature on an independent patient cohort. Patients classified as high risk with our gene expression signature (HR-GES) exhibited significantly higher rates of EMR failure compared with low-risk (LR-GES) patients (78% vs 5%; P < .0001), with an overall accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, HR-GES patients who received frontline nilotinib had a relatively low rate of EMR failure (10%). However, HR-GES patients still had inferior deep molecular response achievement rate by 24 months compared with LR-GES patients.

APN is thought to be a very important target for cancer therapy as it is linked to cancer progression and metastasis. However, bestatin (Ubenimex) is the only approved drug that targets various aminopeptidases for the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia and lymphedema. A compound 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoylvalylisoleucine (also known as LYRM03), isolated from a Streptomyces strain HCCB10043, exhibited more potent inhibitory activity than bestatin. In this work, we applied a chemical synthesis strategy to generate LYRM03 to overcome the low yields typically achieved from fermentation. Finally, we explored a suite of experiments to determine the bioactivity of LYRM03 and revealed that the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly restrained with LYRM03 treatment or injection both in vitro and in vivo. Because of its anti-metastasis capacity, further structure modifications of LYRM03 will be of interest for its use alone or in combination as a therapy in cancer.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*APN/CD13', '*Breast cancer', '*LYRM03', '*MDA-MB-231', '*Metastasis']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Almost all the variant chimeric proteins share the same RARalpha component. Currently, more than 11 fusion partners of RARalpha have been identified, of which PML accounts for 95%, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) take up2%, and the remaining are other variants. Although all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide have shown remarkable induction of molecular remission in classical APL, they have no appreciable effects on APL associated with other variant gene fusions (eg, PLZF-RARalpha and STAT5b-RARalpha). Here, we summarize all variant translocations, their key features, their leukemogenic potential as well as recent advances in studies of PLZF-RARalpha-associated APL. Basic pathogenic differences between classical APL and PLZF-RARalpha-associated APL are further discussed. We also highlight the critical leukemogenic events that are the backbone of these variant translocations so as to gain new insights into refractory APL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*All-trans retinoic acid', '*Arsenic trioxide', '*Chimeric proteins', '*PLZF-RARalpha', '*Variant APL', '*ZBTB16-RARalpha']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are three noncoding RNA (ncRNA) molecules that regulate DNA transcription and translation. With the development of RNA-Seq technology, more and more ncRNAs that are closely related to AML leukemogenesis have been discovered. Numerous studies have found that these ncRNAs play an important role in leukemia cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Some may potentially be used as prognostic biomarkers.

Various genome-wide association studies in different population groups have revealed that polymorphisms in Telomere maintenance gene (TERT) gene located on 5p15.33 is associated with susceptibility to leukemia and lung cancer risk. However, association of TERT with leukemia and lung cancer risk in north Indian population groups is still unknown. This study observed the association between genetic variant rs2853677 of TERT and leukemia and lung cancer in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, India. METHODS: A total of 781 subjects, out of which 381 cases (203 leukemic patients and 178 non-small cell lung cancer patients NSCLC) and 400 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Genetic variant rs2853677of TERT was detected using the real-time and Taqman Chemistry. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was assessed using the chi square test. The allele and genotype- specific risks were estimated as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: We observed that variant rs2853677 was strongly associated with lung cancer and leukemia risk with an odds ratio (OR) =1.8 (1.03-3.2 at 95% CI); p value (adjusted) = 0.03; odds ratio (OR) =2.9 (1.4-5.5.at 95% CI); p value (adjusted) = 0.002, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that rs2853677 of TERT signifies association in multiple cancers and suggests that it can become potential marker for diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and leukemia. The study will provide an insight in understanding the genetic etiology and highlights the role of telomere-associated pathways in non-small cell lung cancer and leukemia. However, it would be quite interesting to explore the contribution of this variant in other cancers as well.","['DST/SSTP/J&K/459/Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and', 'Technology (IN)']",PMC6533689,,['NOTNLM'],"['Jammu and Kashmir', 'Leukemia', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recovery of counts during induction chemotherapy is not well described. Material and methods: Records for 63 children with ALL were reviewed. Peripheral hematology blood counts during five weeks of induction chemotherapy were extracted, and the time to partial recovery with safe counts and complete recovery with normal counts in the three cell lines determined. The number of red cell and platelet transfusions, the number of febrile episodes, and the number of days on intravenous antibiotics were counted. Results: Platelet recovery occurred early: median time to achieving counts >50/nL 14 days, to counts >100/nL 16 days. Neutrophil recovery was relatively slow: median time to counts >0.5/nL 18 days, to counts >1.0/nL 26 days. The time to partial recovery was shorter in high risk than in lower-risk treatment groups. Partial platelet recovery by day 15 indicated early recovery and lower morbidity. Complete platelet recovery day 15 was significantly associated with residual disease <0.1% after four weeks. Lymphocyte counts showed a marked decrease in first two weeks followed by a rise in the next three weeks; a count <0.35/nL on day 15 was associated with poor response.

The network meta-analysis assesses the relative efficacy of novel targeted agents for the treatment of a relapse or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A systematic literature search included seven phase III randomized controlled trials, including a total of 2512 patients treated with nine regimens. Data were extracted and evidence synthesized using network meta-analysis. All novel targeted therapies were significantly more effective than ofatumumab and demonstrated promising prolongation of progression free survival (PFS), with a hazard ratio (HR) ranging from 0.10 to 0.52. Two novel targeted agent regimens, venetoclax plus rituximab and ibrutinib monotherapy, resulted in greater overall survival (HR, 0.335 and 0.361, respectively). Venetoclax plus rituximab and ibrutinib monotherapy were most favorable based on (1) HR for PFS compared with ofatumumab (Ibrutinib: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.07-0.14; Venetoclax plus rituximab: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.21) and SUCRA value (probability of being best) (Ibrutinib SUCRA, 0.92; Venetoclax rituximab SUCRA, 0.90) (2) HR for overall survival compared with ofatumumab (Ibrutinib: HR, 0.361; 95% CI, 0.208-0.627; Venetoclax rituximab: HR, 0.335; 95% CI, 0.112-0.997) and SUCRA value (Ibrutinib SUCRA, 0.84; Venetoclax rituximab SUCRA, 0.85) Both treatments reduced the risk of progression or death by 90% versus conventional ofatumumab.

Epub 2019 May 6.,"BACKGROUND: The hedgehog signaling pathway is normally tightly regulated. Mutations in hedgehog pathway components may lead to abnormal activation. Aberrantly activated hedgehog signaling plays a major role in the development of solid and hematological cancer. In recent years, inhibitors have been developed that attenuate hedgehog signaling; 2 have been approved for use in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), while others are under development or in clinical trials. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of known hedgehog inhibitors (HHIs) and their potential for the treatment of hematological cancers and solid tumors beyond BCC. DESIGN: Published literature was searched to identify articles relating to HHIs in noncutaneous cancer. Both preclinical and clinical research articles were included. In addition, relevant clinical trial results were identified from www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information on the pharmacology of HHIs is also included. RESULTS: HHIs show activity in a variety of solid and hematological cancers. In preclinical studies, HHIs demonstrated efficacy in pancreatic cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In clinical studies, HHIs showed activity in medulloblastoma, as well as prostate, pancreatic, and hematological cancers. Current clinical trials testing the efficacy of HHIs are underway for prostate, pancreatic, and breast cancers, as well as multiple myeloma and AML. CONCLUSIONS: As clinical trial results become available, it will be possible to discern which additional tumor types are suited to HHI mono- or combination therapy with other anticancer agents. The latter strategy may be useful for delaying or overcoming drug resistance.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hedgehog inhibitors', 'Hedgehog signaling', 'Itraconazole', 'Sonidegib', 'Vismodegib']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 21.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct type of acute myeloid leukemia that is defined by the presence of the translocations that mostly involve the RARA gene. The most frequent translocation is the t(15;17), which fuses the RARA gene with the PML gene. Previous studies have shown that other cooperative mutations are required for the development of APL after the initiating event of the t(15;17). In this study, we combined cytogenetics with next-generation sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism array to study the genetic complexity in 20 APL cases diagnosed in our institution. All but 3 cases had additional genetic aberrations. Our study demonstrated that somatic mutations are frequent events in APL. In addition to the previously reported recurrent cooperative mutations in the FLT3, WT1, and RAS genes, we identified mutations in several epigenetic modifiers, including TET2, EZH2, and DNMT3A, co-occurring with either FLT3 or WT1 mutations. Mutations of the WT1 gene and chromosome 11p copy neutral loss of heterozygosity affecting WT1 are present in a third of the cases in our series. Two-thirds of APL cases in our study demonstrated a global reduction but focal accumulation of H3K27 methylase (H3K27me) expression, indicating a disorganized chromatin methylation pattern with generally more accessible chromatin status. Our study confirmed genetic complexity of APL and revealed that epigenetic aberrations are more common than previously expected. Although epigenetic modulation is not a common treatment strategy in APL, targeting this pathway may have some clinical utility in refractory or relapsed APL cases.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*Copy neutral loss of heterozygosity', '*Epigenetics', '*Next-generation sequencing', '*SNP array', '*Somatic mutations']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 22.,"IkappaBalpha protein plays an important role in NFkappaB signaling pathway regulation. The dysfunction of IkappaBalpha is tightly related to various diseases, including cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IkappaBalpha loses its normal functions are diverse and complex. Here, we reported a novel cleavage of IkappaBalpha protein occurred in AML cells. Compared with the full-length IkappaBalpha protein, the truncated IkappaBalpha fragment exhibited a dramatically weak binding ability to NFkappaB complex and showed a significant decreased inhibition on NFkappaB transactivation. Knockdown of PR3, a serine protease mainly expressed in myeloid cells, could inhibit such IkappaBalpha cleavage and enhance the sensitivities of AML cells to the differentiation inducers. In addition, we showed that the level of PR3 mRNA was relatively higher in newly diagnosed AML patients than in those patients with complete remission, suggesting that PR3 expression and its involvement in IkappaBalpha cleavage might be closely associated with AML. Our studies revealed for the first time a PR3-involved IkappaBalpha cleavage in AML cells, providing some new evidences for further understanding the mechanisms underlying the deregulation of NFkappaB pathway in AML. Finally, we also suggested a potential clinical application value of PR3 protein in the treatment and prognosis surveillance for leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Cleavage', '*IkappaBalpha', '*PR3']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: HT-22 mouse hippocampal cells, primary hippocampal cells, and Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model were used to determine the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor on neurons. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence method were used to analyze biological mechanism. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor increased Akt phosphorylation in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent manner in hippocampal cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor also increased the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin and the downstream S6K. Leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription via extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Leukemia inhibitory factor increased c-fos expression through both Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Leukemia inhibitory factor blocked amyloid beta-induced neural viability suppression and inhibited amyloid beta-induced glucose uptake impairment through the block of amyloid beta-mediated insulin receptor downregulation. Leukemia inhibitory factor blocked amyloid beta-mediated induction of the autophagy marker, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3. Additionally, in primary prepared hippocampal cells, leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, demonstrating that leukemia inhibitory factor has physiological relevance in vivo. Suppression of the autophagy marker, light chain 3II, by leukemia inhibitory factor was observed in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with 6TG, and to explore if a safe dose of continuous 6TG can be established. DATA SOURCES: Databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched for 6TG and synonyms from 1998-2018. METHODS: We included studies of patients with ALL or inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) treated with 6TG, excluding studies with 6TG as part of an intensive chemotherapy regimen. We uploaded a protocol to PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018089424). Database and manual searches yielded 1823 unique records. Of these, 395 full-texts were screened for eligibility. Finally, 134 reports representing 42 studies were included. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We included data from 42 studies of ALL and IBD patients; four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 3,993 patients, 20 observational studies including 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. Hepatotoxicity in the form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) occurred in 9-25% of the ALL patients in two of the four included RCTs using 6TG doses of 40-60 mg/m2/day, and long-term hepatotoxicity in the form of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was reported in 2.5%. In IBD patients treated with 6TG doses of approximately 23 mg/m2/day, NRH occurred in 14% of patients. At a 6TG dose of approximately 12 mg/m2/day, NRH was reported in 6% of IBD patients, which is similar to the background incidence. According to this review, doses at or below 12 mg/m2/day are rarely associated with notable hepatotoxicity and can probably be considered safe.",,PMC6534292,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9871-7637', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8495-5274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0829-4993']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 24.,"The establishment of ungulate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been notoriously difficult via a conventional approach. We combined a traditional ESC culture method with reprogramming factors to assist the establishment of porcine naive-like ESCs (nESCs). Pig embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with a tetracycline-inducible vector carrying 4 classic mouse reprogramming factors, followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer and culturing to the blastocyst stage. Then, the inner cell mass was isolated and seeded in culture medium. The naive-like ESCs had characteristic verys similar to those of mouse ESCs and showed no signs of altered morphology or differentiation, even after 130 passages. They depended on leukemia inhibitory factor signals for maintenance of pluripotency, and the female cell lines had low expression of the X-inactive specific transcript gene and no histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation spot. Notably, the ESCs differentiated into 3 germ layers in vitro and could be induced to undergo directional neural and kidney precursor differentiation under defined conditions, and the ESCs could keep proliferating after doxycycline was removed. nESCs can be established, and the well-characterized ESC lines will be useful for the research of transgenic pig models for human disease.-Zhang, M., Wang, C., Jiang, H., Liu, M., Yang, N., Zhao, L., Hou, D., Jin, Y., Chen, Q., Chen, Y., Wang, J., Dai, Y., Li, R.

Different institutes adopt different approaches for the administration of TBI-RIST, and since no study had previously investigated this issue, a survey of the TBI schedules in Japan was conducted. In October 2015, the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group initiated a national survey of TBI-RIST procedures conducted between 2010 and 2014. Of 186 institutions performing TBI, 90 (48%) responded to the survey, 78 of which performed TBI-RIST. Of 2488 patients who underwent TBI for malignant disease at these institutions, 1412 (56.8%) patients were treated for leukemia, 477 (19.2%) for malignant lymphoma, 453 (18.2) for myelodysplastic syndrome, 44 (1.8%) for multiple myeloma, and 102 (4.1%) for other malignant diseases. Further, 206 (52.0%) of 396 patients (a high proportion of patients) who underwent TBI for benign disease had aplastic anemia. The TBI-RIST equipment and treatment methods were similar to those used for myeloablative regimens. Routinely shielded organs included the lungs (43.6%), eyes (50.0%) and kidneys (10.2%). The ovaries (14.1%), thyroid (6.4%) and testicles (16.7%) were also frequently shielded, possibly reflecting an emphasis on shielding reproductive organs in children. TBI-RIST was performed more frequently than myeloablative conditioning in patients with benign disease. Genital and thyroid shielding were applied more frequently in patients treated with TBI-RIST than in patients treated with myeloablative conditioning. In conclusion, this study indicates the status of TBI-RIST in Japan and can assist future efforts to standardize TBI-RIST treatment methods and to design a future multicenter collaborative research study.",,PMC6805977,,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'national survey', 'reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation', 'total-body irradiation']",,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effects of RNA splicing machinery gene mutations on prognosis of MDS patients. METHODS: We searched English database including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library for literatures published within recent 10 years on the effect of RNA splicing machinery genes in MDS. Revman version 5.2 software was used for all the statistical processing. We calculated risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of continuous variables, and find hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of time-to-event data. RESULTS: We included 19 studies enrolling 4320 patients. There is a significant superior overall survival (OS) in splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1)-mutation group compared to unmutated group (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.5-0.67, P < .00001); OS decreased significantly in serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2/ U2 auxiliary factor protein 1 (SRSF2/U2AF1) mutation group compared to unmutated group, (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.34-1.97, P < .00001 and HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.9, P < .00001, respectively).

Other RNA splicing gene mutation group showed significant poor LFS than unmutated groups, (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.6-2.23, P < .00001; HR = 2.77, 95% CI: 2.24-3.44, P < .00001; HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.08-2.03, P < .00001; for SRSF2, U2AF1, and zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2 [ZRSR2], respectively). As for subgroup of low- or intermediate-1-IPSS risk MDS, SRSF2, and U2AF1 mutations were related to poor OS. (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.43-2.35, P < .00001; HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.59-2.79, P < .00001 for SRSF2 and U2AF1, respectively). SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations were strongly associated with male patients. SF3B1 mutation was strongly associated with disease staging. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates a positive effect of SF3B1 and an adverse prognostic effect of SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutations in patients with MDS. Mutations of RNA splicing genes have important effects on the prognosis of MDS.",,PMC6571257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 24.,"Outcomes in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) are steadily improving due to intensive therapy. Between 1989 and 2008, 599 children with newly diagnosed T-ALL were enrolled in two successive European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Children's Leukaemia Group trials (58881 and 58951), both based on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol and without cranial irradiation. In the latter trial induction chemotherapy was intensified. The most important randomizations were Medac Escherichia coli asparaginase versus Erwinia asparaginase in trial 58881, and dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2) /day) versus prednisolone (60 mg/m(2) /day) and prolonged versus conventional asparaginase duration in trial 58951. 8-year event-free survival (EFS) increased from 65.1% to 74.0% in trial 58951. Improvement was most profound for patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts <100 x 10(9) /l and ""good responders"" to prephase. Medac E. coli asparaginase was associated with longer EFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, P = 0.0015] and overall survival (HR 0.51, P = 0.0018). Induction therapy with dexamethasone did not improve EFS compared to prednisolone. Remarkably, intensification of central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy in trial 58951 resulted in fewer bone marrow relapses, while the incidence of CNS relapses remained low. In summary, we showed that adequate asparaginase therapy, intensified induction treatment and intensification of CNS-directed chemotherapy can result in an improvement of outcome in T-ALL patients with good prephase response and initial WBC counts <100 x 10(9) /l, representing approximately 50% of T-ALL patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*EORTC', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*asparaginase', '*childhood leukaemia', '*cranial radiotherapy']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2061-7617', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-7205']",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results of targeted next-generation sequencing on three patients with RUNX1 FPDMM who developed acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS). DNA samples were collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood and buccal swabs at different time points. One patient had clonal haematopoiesis, represented by an SRSF2 p.P95R variant, prior to his AML diagnosis, when he developed an additional NRAS p.G12D variant. His sister presented to us with MDS, with a TET2 p.S471fs and identical NRAS p.G12D variant. The third patient, from another family, had an additional RUNX1 p.R204X and an NFE2 p.Q139fs variant at AML diagnosis. This constitutes the first report of NFE2 variants in AML without extramedullary disease and NRAS variants in AML/MDS in the setting of FPDMM. A systematic review of the literature including our findings distinguishes two genetic landscapes at AML transformation from FPDMM characterized by either the presence or absence of somatic abnormalities in RUNX1 with or without variants in genes usually associated with MM. Whether clonal haematopoiesis precedes transformation only in patients without somatic abnormalities in RUNX1 needs further confirmation.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cancer genomics', '*clonal dynamics', '*familial platelet disorders', '*myeloid neoplasms']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6155-3253', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5938-0675']",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 14.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the assessment of post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD) may inform a more effective management approach. We investigated the prognostic utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD detection undertaken before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Forty-two AML subjects underwent serial disease monitoring both by standard methods, and a targeted 42-gene NGS assay, able to detect leukemia-specific mutant alleles (with >0.5% VAF) (mean 5.1 samples per subject). The prognostic relevance of any persisting diagnostic mutation before transplant (</=27 days) was assessed during 22.1 months (median) of post-transplant follow-up. The sensitivity of the NGS assay (27 MRD-positive subjects) exceeded that of the non-molecular methods (morphology, FISH, and flow cytometry) (11 positive subjects). Only one of the 13 subjects who relapsed after HSCT was NGS MRD-negative (92% assay sensitivity). The cumulative incidence of post-transplant leukemic relapse was significantly higher in the pre-transplant NGS MRD-positive (vs MRD-negative) subjects (P = .014). After adjusting for TP53 mutation and transplant conditioning regimen, NGS MRD-positivity retained independent prognostic significance for leukemic relapse (subdistribution hazard ratio = 7.3; P = .05). The pre-transplant NGS MRD-positive subjects also had significantly shortened progression-free survival (P = .038), and marginally shortened overall survival (P = .068). In patients with AML undergoing HSCT, the pre-transplant persistence of NGS-defined MRD imparts a significant, sensitive, strong, and independent increased risk for subsequent leukemic relapse and death. Given that NGS can simultaneously detect multiple leukemia-associated mutations, it can be used in the majority of AML patients to monitor disease burdens and inform treatment decisions.","['OHSU Department of Pathology/International', 'Knight Cancer Institute/International']",,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2103-5144'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The choice of antifungal prophylaxis agent remains controversial, especially in the era of novel targeted therapies. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to determine the incidence of fungal infections and to identify risk factors associated with IMI. Methods: Adult patients with AML receiving anti-Aspergillus prophylaxis were included to determine the incidence of IMI per 1000 prophylaxis-days. Patients without and with IMI were matched 2:1 based on the day of IMI diagnosis, and multivariable models using logistic regression were constructed to identify risk factors for IMI. Results: Of the 162 included patients, 28 patients had a possible (n = 22), probable, or proven (n = 6) diagnosis of IMI. The incidence of proven or probable IMI per 1000 prophylaxis-days was not statistically different between anti-Aspergillus azoles and micafungin (1.6 vs 5.4, P = .11). The duration of prophylaxis with each agent did not predict IMI occurrence on regression analysis. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.004-1.081; P = .03) and relapsed/refractory AML diagnosis (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.56-12.64; P = .003) were associated with IMI on multivariable analysis. Conclusions: In cases that preclude use of anti-Aspergillus azoles for prophylaxis, micafungin 100 mg once daily may be considered; however, in older patients and those with relapsed/refractory disease, diligent monitoring for IMI is required, irrespective of the agent used for antifungal prophylaxis.",,PMC6524834,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antifungal prophylaxis', 'azole antifungals', 'echinocandins', 'invasive fungal infections']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0436-8948'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a CML patient with both a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement and JAK2 V617F mutation. CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our department with a history of significant thrombocytosis for 20 d. Color Doppler ultrasound examination showed mild splenomegaly. Bone marrow aspiration revealed a karyotype of 46, XX, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) in 20/20 metaphases by cytogenetic analysis, rearrangement of BCR-ABL1 (32.31%) by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mutation of JAK2 V617F (10%) by PCR and Sanger DNA sequencing. The patient was diagnosed with CML and JAK2 V617F mutation. Following treatment with imatinib for 3 mo, the patient had an optimal response and BCR-ABL1 (IS) was 0.143%, while the mutation rate of JAK2 V617F rose to 15%. CONCLUSION: Emphasis should be placed on the detection of JAK2 mutation when CML is diagnosed to distinguish JAK2 mutation-positive CML and formulate treatment strategies.",,PMC6511928,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Case report', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'JAK2 V617F', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm']",,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts', 'of interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"PRMT5, which regulates gene expression by symmetric dimethylation of histones and non-histone target proteins, is overexpressed and plays a pathogenic role in many cancers. In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the mechanisms of PRMT5 dysregulation and its role in lymphomagenesis remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that B cell receptor (BCR) signaling regulates PRMT5 expression in DLBCL cells. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals elevated levels of PRMT5 expression in DLBCL cases and in germinal center (GC) B cells when compared to naive B cells. PRMT5 can be induced in naive B cells by BCR stimulation. We discovered that BTK-NF-kappaB signaling induces PRMT5 transcription in activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL cells while BCR downstream PI3K-AKT-MYC signaling upregulates PRMT5 expression in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cells. PRMT5 inhibition inhibits the growth of DLBCL cells in vitro and patient derived xenografts. Genomic and biochemical analysis demonstrate that PRMT5 promotes cell cycle progression and activates PI3K-AKT signaling, suggesting a feedback regulatory mechanism to enhance cell survival and proliferation. Co-targeting PRMT5 and AKT by their specific inhibitors is lethal to DLBCL cell lines and primary cancer cells. Therefore, this study provides a mechanistic rationale for clinical trials to evaluate PRMT5 and AKT inhibitors for DLBCL.","['K08 CA174750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA187299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7494157,['NIHMS1625614'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia and spermatogenesis is dependent on tightly co-ordinated transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The RNA helicase DDX5 is expressed by spermatogonia but roles in spermatogenesis are unexplored. Using an inducible knockout mouse model, we characterise an essential role for DDX5 in spermatogonial maintenance and show that Ddx5 is indispensable for male fertility. We demonstrate that DDX5 regulates appropriate splicing of key genes necessary for spermatogenesis. Moreover, DDX5 regulates expression of cell cycle genes in undifferentiated spermatogonia post-transcriptionally and is required for cell proliferation and survival. DDX5 can also act as a transcriptional co-activator and we demonstrate that DDX5 interacts with PLZF, a transcription factor required for germline maintenance, to co-regulate select target genes. Combined, our data reveal a critical multifunctional role for DDX5 in regulating gene expression programmes and activity of undifferentiated spermatogonia.","['APP1078042/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council', '(NHMRC)/International', 'FT140101029/Department of Education and Training | Australian Research Council', '(ARC)/International']",PMC6533336,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5577-5645', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4549-7017', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3853-2614']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"The pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves serial acquisition of mutations controlling several cellular processes, requiring combination therapies affecting key downstream survival nodes in order to treat the disease effectively. The BCL2 selective inhibitor venetoclax has potent anti-leukemia efficacy; however, resistance can occur due to its inability to inhibit MCL1, which is stabilized by the MAPK pathway. In this study, we aimed to determine the anti-leukemia efficacy of concomitant targeting of the BCL2 and MAPK pathways by venetoclax and the MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib, respectively. The combination demonstrated synergy in seven of 11 AML cell lines, including those resistant to single agents, and showed growth-inhibitory activity in over 60% of primary samples from patients with diverse genetic alterations. The combination markedly impaired leukemia progenitor functions, while maintaining normal progenitors. Mass cytometry data revealed that BCL2 protein is enriched in leukemia stem/progenitor cells, primarily in venetoclax-sensitive samples, and that cobimetinib suppressed cytokine-induced pERK and pS6 signaling pathways. Through proteomic profiling studies, we identified several pathways inhibited downstream of MAPK that contribute to the synergy of the combination. In OCI-AML3 cells, the combination downregulated MCL1 protein levels and disrupted both BCL2:BIM and MCL1:BIM complexes, releasing BIM to induce cell death. RNA sequencing identified several enriched pathways, including MYC, mTORC1, and p53 in cells sensitive to the drug combination. In vivo, the venetoclax-cobimetinib combination reduced leukemia burden in xenograft models using genetically engineered OCI-AML3 and MOLM13 cells. Our data thus provide a rationale for combinatorial blockade of MEK and BCL2 pathways in AML.",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7049339,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No targeted therapy exists for these heterogeneous and often aggressive diseases. Given the shortage of models for PTCL, we mimicked graded STAT5A or STAT5B activity by expressing hyperactive Stat5a or STAT5B variants at low or high levels in the hematopoietic system of transgenic mice. Only mice with high activity levels developed a lethal disease resembling human PTCL. Neoplasia displayed massive expansion of CD8(+) T cells and destructive organ infiltration. T cells were cytokine-hypersensitive with activated memory CD8(+) T-lymphocyte characteristics. Histopathology and mRNA expression profiles revealed close correlation with distinct subtypes of PTCL. Pronounced STAT5 expression and activity in samples from patients with different subsets underline the relevance of JAK/STAT as a therapeutic target. JAK inhibitors or a selective STAT5 SH2 domain inhibitor induced cell death and ruxolitinib blocked T-cell neoplasia in vivo We conclude that enhanced STAT5A or STAT5B action both drive PTCL development, defining both STAT5 molecules as targets for therapeutic intervention.",,PMC7012494,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Leukemic stem cells are multipotent, self-renewing, highly proliferative cells that can withstand drug treatments. Although currently available treatments potentially destroy blast cells, they fail to eradicate leukemic progenitor cells completely. Aldehyde dehydrogenase and STAT3 are frequently up-regulated in pre-leukemic stem cells as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expressing the CD34(+)CD38(-) phenotype. The Isatin analog, KS99 has shown anticancer activity against multiple myeloma which may, in part, be mediated by inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase activation. Here we demonstrate that KS99 selectively targets leukemic stem cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3. KS99 targeted cells co-expressing CD34, CD38, CD123, TIM-3, or CD96 immunophenotypes in AML, alone or in combination with the standard therapeutic agent cytarabine. AML with myelodysplastic-related changes was more sensitive than de novo AML with or without NPM1 mutation. KS99 treatment reduced the clonogenicity of primary human AML cells as compared to normal cord blood mononuclear cells. Downregulation of phosphorylated Bruton's tyrosine kinase, STAT3, and aldehyde dehydrogenase was observed, suggesting interaction with KS99 as predicted through docking. KS99 with or without cytarabine showed in vivo preclinical efficacy in human and mouse AML animal models and prolonged survival. KS99 was well tolerated with overall negligible adverse effects. In conclusion, KS99 inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and STAT3 activities and causes cell death of leukemic stem cells, but not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.",['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7049373,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Hydroxyurea is the standard treatment in high-risk patients with polycythemia vera. However, estimates of its effect in terms of clinical outcomes (thrombosis, bleeding, hematologic transformations and mortality) are lacking. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the absolute risk of events in recent cases of patients under hydroxyurea treatment. We searched for relevant articles or abstracts in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, LILACS. Sixteen studies published from 2008 to 2018 reporting number of events using World Health Organization diagnosis for polycythemia vera were selected. Through a random effect logistic model, incidences, study heterogeneity and confounder effects were estimated for each outcome at different follow ups. Overall, 3,236 patients were analyzed. While incidences of thrombosis and acute myeloid leukemia were stable over time, mortality and myelofibrosis varied depending on follow-up duration. Thrombosis rates were 1.9%, 3.6% and 6.8% persons/year at median ages 60, 70 and 80 years, respectively. Higher incidence of arterial events was predicted by previous cardiovascular complication. Leukemic transformation incidence was 0.4% persons/year. Incidence of transformation to myelofibrosis and mortality were significantly dependent on age and follow-up duration. For myelofibrosis, rates were 5.0 at five years and 33.7% at ten years; overall mortality was 12.6% and 56.2% at five and ten years, respectively. In conclusion, we provide reliable risk estimates for the main outcomes in polycythemia vera patients under hydroxyurea treatment.

Patients may have asymptomatic changes on imaging studies that spontaneously regress, and little is known about the natural history of osteonecrotic changes seen. The main aim of the British OsteoNEcrosis Study (BONES) is to determine the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic osteonecrosis in the lower extremities of survivors of ALL or LBL diagnosed aged 10-24 years in the UK at different time points in their treatment. This study also aims to identify risk factors for progression and the development of symptomatic osteonecrosis in this population, as well as specific radiological features that predict for progression or regression in those with asymptomatic osteonecrosis METHODS AND ANALYSIS: BONES is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study based at principal treatment centres around the UK. Participants are patients aged 10-24 years diagnosed with ALL or LBL under standard criteria. Assessment for osteonecrosis will be within 4 weeks of diagnosis, at the end of delayed intensification and 1, 2 and 3 years after the start of maintenance therapy. Assessment will consist of MRI scans of the lower limbs and physiotherapy assessment. Clinical and biochemical data will be collected at each of the time points. Bone mineral density data and vertebral fracture assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry will be collected at diagnosis and annually for 3 years after diagnosis of malignancy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained through the Yorkshire and Humber Sheffield Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 16/YH/0206). Study results will be published on the study website, in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences and via social media.

Epub 2019 May 23.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) represents a life-threatening demyelinating disorder of the brain caused by reactivation of a rare opportunistic infection with JC Polyomavirus. The aims of this study were to describe the incidence of a susceptibility-weighted imaging hypointense rim in patients with multifocal leukoencephalopathy and to explore the histologic correlates and prognostic value of the rim with regard to the clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 18 patients with a definite diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Ten patients were HIV-positive, 3 patients had natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, 1 patient had multiple myeloma, 3 patients had a history of lymphoma, and 1 was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Patients were divided into short- (up to 12 months) and long-term (>12 months) survivors. A total of 93 initial and follow-up MR imaging examinations were reviewed. On SWI, the presence and development of a hypointense rim at the periphery of the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy lesions were noted. A postmortem histologic examination was performed in 2 patients: A rim formed in one, and in one, there was no rim. RESULTS: A total of 73 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy lesions were observed. In 13 (72.2%) patients, a well-defined thin, linear, hypointense rim at the periphery of the lesion toward the cortical side was present, while in 5 (27.8%) patients, it was completely absent. All 11 long-term survivors and 2 short-term survivors presented with a prominent SWI-hypointense rim, while 5/7 short-term survivors did not have this rim. CONCLUSIONS: The thin, uniformly linear, gyriform SWI-hypointense rim in the paralesional U-fibers in patients with definite progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy might represent an end-point stage of the neuroinflammatory process in long-term survivors.",,PMC7028608,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9746-0932', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9701-5484', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0340-0117', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2948-4187']",['(c) 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We previously reported the safety and efficacy of sorafenib, an FLT3 inhibitor, as a maintenance agent after allo-HSCT in patients diagnosed with AML with FLT3 mutations. We provide an update on the 27 patients with FLT3-mutated AML in our original report, who received sorafenib as a single maintenance agent. RESULTS: Since our previous report, others have confirmed our reported significant overall survival and progression-free survival in patients who received sorafenib before and/or after allo-HSCT. In this update on the 27 patients with FLT3-mutated AML in our original report, we show persistence of the previously reported impressive long-term disease control. CONCLUSION: Our results, with longer follow-up than in our previous report, together with those of others, further support the use of sorafenib as a maintenance agent after allo-HSCT.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia', '*Maintenance treatment', '*Sorafenib', '*Update']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, TK inhibitors have drastically changed the disease prognosis. However, persistence of the transformed hematopoiesis even in patients who achieved a complete response to TK inhibitors and the disease relapse upon therapy discontinuation represent a major obstacle to CML cure. METHODS: Thiostrepton, Danusertib and Volasertib were used to investigate the effects of FOXM1, AKA and Plk1 inhibition in K562-S and K562-R cells. Apoptotic cell death was quantified by annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to assess BCR-ABL1, FOXM1, PLK1 and AURKA expression. Protein expression and activation was assessed by Western Blotting (WB). Clonogenic assay were performed to confirm K562-R resistance to Imatinib and to evaluate cells sensitivity to the different drugs. RESULTS: Here we proved that BCR-ABL1 TK-dependent hyper-activation of Aurora kinase A (AURKA)-Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-FOXM1 axis is associated with the outcome of Imatinib (IM) resistance in an experimental model (K562 cell line) and bone marrow hematopoietic cells. Notably, such a biomolecular trait was detected in the putative leukemic stem cell (LSC) compartment characterized by a CD34+ phenotype. Constitutive phosphorylation of FOXM1 associated with BCR-ABL1 TK lets FOXM1 binding with beta-catenin enables beta-catenin nuclear import and recruitment to T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription complex, hence supporting leukemic cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, the inhibition of single components of AURKA-PLK1-FOXM1 axis in response to specific drugs raises the expression of growth factor/DNA damage-inducible gene a (GADD45a), a strong inhibitor of AURKA and, as so, a critical component whose induction may mediate the eradication of leukemic clone. CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusion is that AURKA, PLK1 and FOXM1 inhibition may be considered as a promising therapeutic approach to cure CML.","['16996/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'GR-2016-02364880/Ministero della Salute']",PMC6533706,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aurora kinase a', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'FOXM1', 'Polo-like kinase 1', 'beta-Catenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, NDRG2 functions on anticancer drug sensitivity, and its molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully investigated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of NDRG2-induced sensitization to As2O3 in the U937 cell line, which is one of the most frequently used cells in the field of resistance to As2O3. NDRG2-overexpressing U937 cells (U937-NDRG2) showed a higher sensitivity to As2O3 than mock control U937 cell (U937-Mock). The higher sensitivity to As2O3 in U937-NDRG2 was associated with Mcl-1 degradation through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) activation. Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta was significantly reduced in U937-NDRG2, and the reduction was diminished by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. NDRG2 mediated the interaction between GSK3beta and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), inducing dephosphorylation of GSK3beta at S9 by PP2A. Although the C-terminal deletion mutant of NDRG2 (DeltaC NDRG2), which could not interact with PP2A, interacted with GSK3beta, the mutant failed to dephosphorylate GSK3beta at S9 and increased sensitivity to As2O3. Our findings suggest that NDRG2 is a kind of adaptor protein mediating the interaction between GSK3beta and PP2A, inducing GSK3beta activation through dephosphorylation at S9 by PP2A, which increases sensitivity to As2O3 in U937 cells.",,PMC6562968,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1', '*PP2A-NDRG2-GSK3beta complex', '*U937', '*apoptosis', '*arsenic trioxide', '*myeloid leukemia']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4024-6868', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6505-3080']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HoxA9 is expressed in myeloid progenitors, with its level diminishing during myeloid maturation, and HOXA9 is over-expressed in a majority of acute myeloid leukemia cases, including those expressing NUP98-HOXD13. The objective of this study was to determine whether HoxA9 directly represses Cebpa gene expression. We find 4-fold increased HoxA9 and 5-fold reduced Cebpa in marrow common myeloid and LSK progenitors from Vav-NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice. Conversely, HoxA9 decreases 5-fold while Cebpa increases during granulocytic differentiation of 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. Activation of exogenous HoxA9-ER in 32Dcl3 cells reduces Cebpa mRNA even in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting direct repression. Cebpa transcription in murine myeloid cells is regulated by a hematopoietic-specific +37 kb enhancer and by a more widely active +8 kb enhancer. ChIP-Seq analysis of primary myeloid progenitor cells expressing exogenous HoxA9 or HoxA9-ER demonstrates that HoxA9 localizes to both the +8 kb and +37 kb Cebpa enhancers. Gel shift analysis demonstrates HoxA9 binding to three consensus sites in the +8 kb enhancer, but no affinity for the single near-consensus site present in the +37 kb enhancer. Activity of a Cebpa +8 kb enhancer/promoter-luciferase reporter in 32Dcl3 or MOLM14 myeloid cells is increased ~2-fold by mutation of its three HOXA9-binding sites, suggesting that endogenous HoxA9 represses +8 kb Cebpa enhancer activity. In contrast, mutation of five C/EBPalpha-binding sites in the +8 kb enhancer reduces activity 3-fold. Finally, expression of a +37 kb enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene reporter is reduced ~2-fold in marrow common myeloid progenitors when the Vav-NUP98-HOXD13 transgene is introduced. Overall, these data support the conclusion that HoxA9 represses Cebpa expression, at least in part via inhibition of its +8 kb enhancer, potentially allowing normal myeloid progenitors to maintain immaturity and contributing to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia associated with increased HOXA9.","['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL130034/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6532930,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5615-7061'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations, resulting in tumor cells with different somatic mutations known as clones. Drug responsiveness and therapeutics of cancer depend on the accurate detection of the clones in a tumor sample. Recent research has considered inferring clonal composition of a tumor sample using computational models based on the short read data of the sample generated using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Short reads (segmented DNA parts of different tumor cells) are noisy; therefore, inferring the clones and their mutations from the data is a difficult and complex problem. Existing methods to infer clones from noisy NGS data do not consider the presence of long-range mutational influences. Therefore, we develop a new model, called extended multiple sample tumor heterogeneity prediction by factorial Hidden Markov model (emHetFHMM), based on factorial hidden Markov models to infer clones and their proportions by capturing the long-range mutational influences. In our model, each hidden chain represents the genomic signature of a clone, and a mixture of chains results in the observed data. We make use of Gibbs sampling and exponentiated gradient algorithms to infer the hidden variables and mixing proportions.

Epub 2019 May 23.,"PRDM family proteins are dysregulated in many human diseases, especially hematological malignancies and solid cancers, and share a unique N-terminal PR domain followed by zinc fingers toward the C terminus. With a high frequency of DNA promoter hypermethylation, PRDM5 is primarily considered as a tumor suppressor in solid tumors. However, little is known about the function of PRDM5 in blood malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we showed that high PRDM5 expression levels were independently correlated with poor overall survival in AML patients. PRDM5 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration in vitro and enhanced tumorigenesis in an in vivo xenograft model. Furthermore, we found that PRDM5 overexpression promoted cell cycle progression with the decreased level of cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21, and regulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers ZO-1 and Vimentin to promote migration. Moreover, we observed that PRDM5 upregulated the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and downregulated c-Myc expression. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK by SP600125 partially abrogated PRDM5-induced cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PRDM5 functions as an oncogenic driver in AML via JNK pathway, suggesting that PRDM5 is a potential therapeutic target for AML.",,PMC6639193,,['NOTNLM'],"['*JNK', '*PRDM5', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*c-Myc', '*migration', '*proliferation']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8288-5022'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

However, currently no specific therapies have been reported for t (8;21) AML patients as AML1-ETO is still intractable as a pharmacological target. For this purpose, leukaemia cells and AML1-ETO-induced murine leukaemia model were used to investigate the degradation of AML1-ETO by melatonin (MLT), synthesized and secreted by the pineal gland. MLT remarkedly decreased AML1-ETO protein in leukemic cells. Meanwhile, MLT induced apoptosis, decreased proliferation and reduced colony formation. Furthermore, MLT reduced the expansion of human leukemic cells and extended the overall survival in U937T-AML1-ETO-xenografted NSG mice. Most importantly, MLT reduced the infiltration of leukaemia blasts, decreased the frequency of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) and prolonged the overall survival in AML1-ETO-induced murine leukaemia. Mechanistically, MLT increased the expression of miR-193a, which inhibited AML1-ETO expression via targeting its putative binding sites. Furthermore, MLT decreased the expression of beta-catenin, which is required for the self-renewal of LSC and is the downstream of AML1-ETO. Thus, MLT presents anti-self-renewal of LSC through miR-193a-AML1-ETO-beta-catenin axis. In conclusion, MLT might be a potential treatment for t (8;21) leukaemia by targeting AML1-ETO oncoprotein.",,PMC6653044,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML1-ETO', '*leukaemia stem cell', '*melatonin', '*miR-193a', '*self-renewal']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1223-4325'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We studied whether in vitro platelet function predicts future bleeding in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and thrombocytopenia. Adult AML patients with platelet count <5.0 x 10(10) /L were included. Detailed bleeding history and blood samples were collected at inclusion and every 7 days. We analyzed hematology and coagulation parameters. With flow cytometry we evaluated platelet activation (activated GPIIb/IIIa, P-selectin, and CD63 expression), and platelet aggregation. Agonists were thrombin-receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). During 18 months, sixty participants were enrolled and followed for a total of 114 weeks. Bleeding occurred in 52 weeks, and was not associated with clinical, hematology or coagulation parameters. Predictors of bleeding were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for platelet count, sex, and age. Bleeding history and receiver operating curves were compared using c-index. Reduced TRAP-induced platelet aggregation had Odds ratio 3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-6.60). Reduced CRP-XL-induced platelet aggregation had Odds ratio 4.00 (95%-CI 1.70-9.20) for bleeding. Overall, C-index was 0.71 for the models including platelet aggregation results, 0.72 for activated GPIIb/IIIa-positive platelets after stimulation with TRAP, 0.68 for percent P-selectin positive platelets with TRAP and 0.63 for the platelet count. Among patients receiving no platelet transfusion, C-index was 0.83-0.91 for bleeding; highest for models using platelet aggregation.

This study was conducted to assess clinical significance of expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes, namely ND3, SDHB, Cytochrome b, Cytochrome C, and ATP6, in pediatric AML. Pediatric AML patients from July 2013 to June 2016 were enrolled in this prospective study. Relative genes expression was determined using real-time PCR, and expressed as fold change. 123 AML patients were enrolled, median age 10 (range 0.7-18 years). ND3 gene expression was significantly increased in poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.03). In univariate analysis, high ND3 and ATP6 gene expression was significantly associated with inferior EFS (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively) and OS (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively), whereas, in multivariate analysis, ND3 gene expression emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for EFS and OS (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03). ND3 gene expression is a significant predictor of EFS and OS in pediatric AML, and should be evaluated as a potential biomarker.","['BT/PR7197/MED/30/899/2012/Department of Biotechnology', 'F.5-59/IRG/2010/RS/All-India Institute of Medical Sciences']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Gene expression', 'Mitochondrial', 'ND3', 'Pediatric']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9367-4407'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With recent advances in molecular testing, targeting particular leukemogenic mutations such as those occurring in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) became possible. Enasidenib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2). Aim: The objective of this article is to review the evidence for the use of enasidenib in R/R AML, as well as to outline future directions of enasidenib therapy. Evidence Review: Enasidenib was approved in August 2017, after a successful Phase I/II trial showing an overall response rate (ORR) of 40.3% in R/R disease, with 19.3% of patients achieving complete remission (CR). Enrollees in the trial were mostly older adults. The most prominent toxicities were hyperbilirubinemia and IDH-differentiation syndrome (IDH-DS), though the drug was generally well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. A Phase III trial is currently ongoing. Conclusion: Enasidenib provides a new therapeutic option for patients with R/R AML.

We have revisited the immunophenotyping profile of T/M-MPAL and ETP-ALL to identify differences and/or similarities, as these entities represent a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. Patients and methods: A total of 26 ETP-ALL and 10 T/M-MPAL cases were identified among 857 cases of childhood leukemia (T-ALL, n=266 and AML, n=591) before any treatment decisions. The variables analyzed were age strata, sex, clinical features, immunophenotyping, and molecular aberrations. Immunophenotyping was performed in all samples using a panel of cytoplasm and membrane antibodies to identify the lineage and blast differentiation. The mutational status of STIL-TAL1, TLX3, RUNX1, NOTCH1, FBXW7, FLT3, IL7R, RAS, KTM2A, and CDKN2A/B was tested using RT-PCR, FISH, and PCR sequencing methods. The outcomes were assessed in terms of overall survival (OS). Results: The immunophenotypes were similar in ETP-ALL and T/M-MPAL, regarding the cellular expression of CD34, CD117, CD13/CD33, and CD11b, although CD2 and HLA-DR were more frequent in T/M-MPAL (p<0.01). aMPO positivity and myelomonocyte differentiation were definitive in separating both entities. NOTCH1, FLT3-ITD, and N/KRAS mutations as well as TLX3 and KMT2A rearrangements were found in both ETP-ALL and T/M-MPAL. Thirty-one patients received ALL protocol whereas five had AML therapy. The overall 5-year survival rate (pOS) was 56.4% for patients treated using ALL protocols. No differences were observed between T/M-MPAL (pOS of 57%) and ETP-ALL (pOS of 56%) patients. The prognostic value of NOTCH1(mut) was associated with significantly better OS (pOS 90%) than NOTCH1 (wt) (pOS 37%) (p=0.017).

Recently, MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 was reported to kill MCL-1-dependent cancer cells and has potential value in clinical application. Purpose: Herein, we reported MCL-1 expression pattern in Chinese de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its impact on prognosis and may provide theoretical basis for AML patients using MCL-1 inhibitor in clinics. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to detect the transcript of MCL-1 in AML patients. Results: MCL-1 expression was significantly up-regulated in AML compared with controls (P=0.042). We divided the patients into two groups (higher and lower expression of MCL-1) based on the median level. Among both non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), patients with higher expression of MCL-1 correlated with lower complete remission (CR) rate (P=0.031 and 0.004, respectively) and shorter overall survival (OS) time (P=0.008 and 0.004, respectively) compared with those with lower expression of MCL-1. Meanwhile, Cox regression analyses revealed that overexpression of MCL-1 acted as an independent risk factor for OS in non-APL patients and CN-AML patients (P=0.011 and 0.045, respectively).

A revised staging system could better capture prognosis of WM patients in the chemoimmunotherapy era. We developed a revised system based on data from 492 symptomatic patients with at least 3 years and a median of 7 years of follow up while an independent validation cohort included 229 symptomatic patients. We identified age (</=65 vs 66-75 vs >/=76 years), b2-microglobulin >/= 4 mg/L, serum albumin <3.5 gr/dl, and LDH >/= 250 IU/L (ULN < 225) to stratify patients in five different prognostic groups and identify a very-low risk as well as a very-high risk group with a 3-year WM-related death rate of 0, 10, 14, 38, and 48% (p < 0.001) and 10-year survival rate of 84, 59, 37, 19, and 9% (p < 0.001). We evaluated this staging system separately in patients >65 years and <65 years, according to the reason for initiation of treatment, among patients receiving frontline rituximab or in patients treated primarily without rituximab. With further validation before clinical use, this revised IPSSWM could improve WM patient risk stratification, is easily available and may be used in the everyday practice to provide prognostic information.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8191-5832', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5133-1422']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 22.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The unique expression pattern makes oncofetal proteins ideal diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. However, few oncofetal proteins have been identified and entered clinical practice. METHODS: Fetal liver, adult liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues were employed to assess the expression of hepatic leukaemia factor (HLF). The impact of HLF on HCC onset and progression was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. The association between HLF and patient prognosis was determined in patient cohorts. The correlation between HLF expression and sorafenib benefits in HCC was further evaluated in patient cohorts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). RESULTS: HLF is a novel oncofetal protein which is reactivated in HCC by SOX2 and OCT4. Functional studies revealed that HLF transactivates c-Jun to promote tumour initiating cell (TIC) generation and enhances TIC-like properties of hepatoma cells, thus driving HCC initiation and progression. Consistently, our clinical investigations elucidated the association between HLF and patient prognosis and unravelled the close correlation between HLF levels and c-Jun expression in patient HCCs. Importantly, HLF/c-Jun axis determines the responses of hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment, and interference of HLF abrogated c-Jun activation and enhanced sorafenib response.

A disseminated NTM infection is mostly caused by the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and is known to develop in immunocompromised hosts, like those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Here, we report a case of disseminated M. phlei infection in an immunocompetent host carrying anti-interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) autoantibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We detected M. phlei in multiple organs of an elderly woman with no significant medical history except positivity for anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies. She tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, 2/ Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest demonstrated a nodule in the left S1 + 2 segment, interlobular septal thickening, multi lymphadenopathy, and osteolysis. A maximum intensity projection image following fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed multifocal hypermetabolic lesions in the nodule and all the swollen lymph nodes seen in HRCT. FDG also accumulated in multiple bones. Advanced primary lung cancer was suspected, and biopsies of each lesion were performed. The pathology revealed caseating granuloma, positive for acid-fast bacteria, and DNA sequencing of the acid-fast bacteria confirmed the organism to be M. phlei. The patient also tested positive for anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with disseminated M. phlei infection, with anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Though known to be non-pathogenic, we show that M. phlei can be pathogenic like the MAC in immunocompetent individuals carrying anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies.","['jp18fk0108043/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', 'jp18fk0108064/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', 'jp18fk0108075/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', 'jp18jm0510004/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', 'jp18K08312/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'jp18K15966/Grants-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists']",PMC6530062,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoantibody', 'Disseminated infection', 'Interferon gamma', 'M. phlei']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0741-6485'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AML cell lines including CESS, HL-60, MO-1, P31/FUJ, GDM-1 and KASUMI-3 were used as models in this study. RESULTS: After treating the six AML cell lines with a combination of losartan and doxorubicin, they were divided into two groups based on their behaviour: one became more sensitive to drug treatment (Group A) and the other had no change observed in behaviour after drug treatment (Group B). In silico analyses showed that Group A is involved in cellular apoptosis, while Group B is involved in tumour angiogenesis further supporting the in vitro results. CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of the AML cell lines with losartan and doxorubicin resulted in an increase in sensitivity of some of the cell lines. Those leukaemic cells are modulated via the induction of apoptosis, whereas the other cells resistant to the drug treatment are closely related to tumour angiogenesis indicating that RAS-AT1R seems to be differently expressed in different leukaemic blast cells and tumour microenvironments. Pharmaco-biological actions of RAS inhibitors may be different in distinct leukaemic cells based on the pathological behaviour of AML genomic subtypes.",,PMC6537254,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'ANG II', 'AT1R', 'AT2R', 'RAS', 'doxorubicin', 'drug combination', 'losartan']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1514-7294', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-4895']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 4.,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have emerged as significant targets for therapeutic development, owing to their critical nature in diverse biological processes. An ideal PPI-based target is the protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), a critical prosurvival factor in cancers such as multiple myeloma where MCL1 levels directly correlate to disease progression. Current strategies for halting the antiapoptotic properties of MCL1 revolve around inhibiting its sequestration of proapoptotic factors. Existing inhibitors disrupt endogenous regulatory proteins; however, this strategy actually leads to an increase of MCL1 protein levels. Here, we show the development of hetero-bifunctional small molecules capable of selectively targeting MCL1 using a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) methodology leading to successful degradation. We have confirmed the involvement of the E3 ligase CUL4A-DDB1 cereblon ubiquitination pathway, making these PROTACs a first step toward a new class of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family protein degraders.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7917-7068', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5945-6921']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of PRMT4 has been found to be involved in several types of cancers. Selective and in vivo effective PRMT4 inhibitors are needed for demonstrating PRMT4 as a promising therapeutic target. On the basis of compound 6, a weak dual PRMT4/6 inhibitor, we constructed a tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold through a cut-and-sew scaffold hopping strategy. The subsequent SAR optimization efforts employed structure-based approach led to the identification of a novel PRMT4 inhibitor 49. Compound 49 exhibited prominently high potency and selectivity, moderate pharmacokinetic profiles, and good antitumor efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia xenograft model via oral administration, thus demonstrating this compound as a useful pharmacological tool for further target validation and drug development in cancer therapy.",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9776-8136'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Objective: We previously demonstrated that ortho-topolin riboside (oTR) as a naturally occurring cytokinin secreted from Populus x robusta has great potential anticancer effects via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. In the present study, we reveal that oTR induced the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells, which represent the M2 subtype of AML. Materials and Methods: After the incubation of HL-60 cells with oTR, its effect was analyzed with cell viability assay, Wright-Giemsa staining, CD11b protein expression analysis, western blot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction. Results: We found that oTR arrested the cell cycle at the S phase, upregulated the expression of myeloid surface marker CD11b, reduced the nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, and altered the horseshoe shape of nuclei, as evidenced by Wright-Giemsa staining. Furthermore, we found that the protein level of phosphorylated STAT3 was decreased when cells were treated with oTR, while phosphorylated STAT1 was activated. Moreover, the protein level of phosphorylated STAT3 and its upstream kinase, Janus kinase 2, were also inhibited when cells were treated with oTR after increased time. Additionally, the levels of phosphorylated SHP-1 were increased while phosphorylated SHP-2 was decreased. Conclusion: Collectively, our data indicate a differentiation-induced mechanism underlying the inhibition of STAT3 signaling upon treatment with oTR. Therefore, oTR may constitute a novel differentiation-induced therapeutic for use in clinical treatment of AML.",,PMC6682775,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ortho-topolin riboside', '*STAT3 signal', '*HL-60 cells']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6567-2578', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6050-4671', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7797-7192', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8371-2561', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9907-600X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5800-1303', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4545-6442', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5229-2787', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1843-9906']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the advance in lung cancer therapy, the five-year survival rate is extremely restricted due to therapeutic failure and disease relapse. Targeted therapies selectively inhibiting certain molecules in cancer cells have been accepted as promising ways to control cancer. In lung cancer, evidence has suggested that the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) protein, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is a target for drug action. Herein, we report the Mcl-1 targeting activity of renieramycin T (RT), a marine-derived tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid that was isolated from the Thai blue sponge Xestospongia sp. RT was shown to be dominantly toxic to lung cancer cells compared to the normal cells in the lung. The cytotoxicity of this compound toward lung cancer cells was mainly exerted through apoptosis induction. For the mechanism of action, we found that RT mediated activation of p53 protein and caspase-9 and -3 activations. While others Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bak, and Bax) were minimally changed in response to RT, Mcl-1 protein was dramatically diminished. We further performed the cycloheximide experiment and found that the half-life of Mcl-1 was significantly shortened by RT treatment. When MG132, a potent selective proteasome inhibitor, was utilized, it could restore the Mcl-1 level. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that RT significantly increased the formation of Mcl-1-ubiquitin complex compared to the non-treated control. In conclusion, we report the potential apoptosis induction of RT with a mechanism of action involving the targeting of Mcl-1 for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. As Mcl-1 is critical for cancer cell survival and chemotherapeutic failure, this novel information regarding the Mcl-1-targeted compound would be beneficial for the development of efficient anti-cancer strategies or targeted therapies.","['Grant for International Research Integration: Chula Research', 'Scholar/Chulalongkorn University']",PMC6562878,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer', 'Lung cancer', 'Marine sponge', 'Mcl-1 degradation', 'Renieramycin T', 'Xestospongia sp.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8941-1046', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2641-9550', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3103-3249']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with the ability to differentiate into various types of cells, such as osteoblasts and adipocytes, among others. MSCs contribute to the development of a suitable niche for hematopoietic stem cells, and are involved in the development of diseases, such as leukemia, to a yet unknown extent. Here, we describe the effect of 7-KC on the death of bone marrow MSCs from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (LMSCs). LMSCs were less susceptible to the death-promoting effect of 7-KC than other cell types. 7-KC exposure triggered the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis with an increase in activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity. Mechanisms other than caspase-dependent pathways were involved. 7-KC increased ROS generation by LMSCs, which was related to decreased cell viability. 7-KC also led to disruption of the cytoskeleton of LMSCs, increased the number of cells in S phase, and decreased the number of cells in the G1/S transition. Autophagosome accumulation was also observed. 7-KC downregulated the SHh protein in LMSCs but did not change the expression of SMO. In conclusion, oxiapoptophagy (OXIdative stress + APOPTOsis + autophagy) seems to be activated by 7-KC in LMSCs. More studies are needed to better understand the role of 7-KC in the death of LMSCs and the possible effects on the SHh pathway.",,PMC6562391,,['NOTNLM'],"['*7-KC', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*bone marrow', '*mesenchymal stem cell', '*oxysterol']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7492-997X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5745-7843', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0424-9765', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7582-5942']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Dr. Neil Shah, who presented the current data, some clinicians are still unaware that treatment discontinuation is an option. Patients who wish to stop TKI therapy should consult with a CML specialty center to confirm that discontinuation is safe and appropriate; they also should be counseled on all potential benefits and risks of stopping therapy, including TKI withdrawal syndrome. In patients with CML who experience relapse after discontinuing TKI therapy, a second TKI discontinuation can be successful among those who regained a deep molecular response after TKI rechallenge, although experience to date with second discontinuation attempts is very limited. Second-generation TKIs have also demonstrated improvement in rates of deep molecular remission, making treatment discontinuation possible for a larger proportion of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 22.,"Exposure to mold-contaminated indoor air has been associated with various respiratory diseases, and there is a need for experimental data to confirm these associations. The pro-inflammatory properties of well-characterized aerosolized spores and hyphal fragments from Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus versicolor were examined and compared using various human macrophage cell models including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages (THP-1 Ma), primary peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and primary airway macrophages (AM) from induced sputum. X-ray treated samples of the two mold species induced different responses with A. fumigatus displaying the most potent induction of pro-inflammatory responses. While hyphal fragments from A. fumigatus were more potent than spores, similar responses were produced by the two growth stages of A. versicolor. THP-1 Ma was the most sensitive model releasing a broad range of cytokines/chemokines. MDM exhibited a similar cytokine/chemokine profile as THP-1 Ma, except for a low-quantity release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). In contrast, AM appeared to be nonresponsive and yielded a different pattern of pro-inflammatory markers. Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, but also to a certain degree TLR2, was involved in several responses induced by spores and aerosolized hyphal fragments of A. fumigatus in MDM. Taken together, MDM seems to be the most promising experimental macrophage model.

Epub 2019 May 22.,"Platelets are anucleate cells that have a role in several innate immune functions, including the secretion of proteins with antimicrobial activity. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of platelets to secrete thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal proteins and antimicrobial peptides, like hBD-1. However, the expression and secretion of defensins of the alpha family by platelets have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of defensin alpha 1 (DEFA1) in human platelets and megakaryocytes. Our data indicate that DEFA1 mRNA and protein are present in peripheral blood platelets and in the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (MEG-01). DEFA1 co-localize with alpha-granules of platelets and MEG-01 cells, and was also detected in cytoplasm of MEG-01 cells. The assay of our in vitro model of platelet-like particles (PLPs) revealed that MEG-01 cells could transfer DEFA1 mRNA to their differentiated PLPs. Furthermore, platelets secreted DEFA1 into the culture medium when activated with thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, and lipopolysaccharide; meanwhile, MEG-01 cells secreted DEFA1 when activated with thrombopoietin. Platelet's secreted DEFA1 can rebind to platelet's surface and have antibacterial activity against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. In summary, our data indicate that both, human platelets and megakaryocytes, can express and secrete DEFA1. These results suggest a new role of platelets and megakaryocytes in the innate immune response.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antimicrobial peptide', 'defensin alpha 1', 'human neutrophil peptide', 'immunity innate', 'megakaryocyte', 'platelet']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4240-5498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7368-6432', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9867-8765', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2853-4891', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2736-2688', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2587-8445']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and III-IV occurred in 33% and 17% of the patients, respectively. The incidence of 2-year total and extensive chronic GVHD was 38% and 19%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, leukaemia-free survival, overall survival and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 24% and 26%, 56% and 62%, 20% and 12%, 30% and 14% and 12% & 7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with overall survival were age, time from allo-HCT1 to relapse, conditioning for allo-HCT1, Karnofsky score at allo-HCT2 and donor type for allo-HCT2.

The study group (n = 142) included 106 (74.7%) men and 36 (25.3%) women with a median age of 34.9 years (range, 2-79) at diagnosis. Patients were subtyped by flow cytometry immunophenotyping as follows: 33 (23.2%) ETP; 32 (22.5%) early non-ETP; 60 (42.2%) thymic; and 17 (12.1%) mature. Excepting definitional markers, there was a significant differential expression of the markers CD2, CD10, CD33 and TdT between ETP-ALL and non-ETP-ALL. Positive CD33 expression (>/=20% of leukaemic blasts) was detected in 21/33 (63%) ETP-ALL compared with 17/95 (17.9%) non-ETP-ALL (P < 0.001). Notably, targeted anti-CD33 therapy with IMGN779 resulted in significant growth inhibition and increased apoptosis in ETP-ALL cells in vitro. An 11-marker T-ALL immunophenotype score discriminated reliably between ETP and non-ETP ALL. Longitudinal analysis of ETP-ALL cases in this study demonstrated that the immunophenotype may be occasionally dynamic but is largely stable over the disease course. In summary, identification of ETP-ALL might be enhanced by using an 11-marker T-ALL immunophenotype score.

There is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic modalities, in particular such that are tolerated by patients over the age of 60 years, who form the bulk of new acute myeloid leukemia diagnoses. Vosaroxin (SNS-595), a second-generation topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalating agent, shows promising preclinical and clinical activity against acute myeloid leukemia. Venetoclax (ABT-199), a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the anti-leukemic activity and the underlying molecular mechanisms for the combination of venetoclax and vosaroxin in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples ex vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using both acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples, annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analyses were used to quantify apoptosis induced by venetoclax or vosaroxin, alone or in combination, with subsequent western blotting analyses to assess levels of Bcl-2 family proteins. Alkaline comet assays were performed to quantify DNA damage induced by the two agents and to determine the effect of venetoclax on DNA repair. Finally, colony-forming assays were conducted on normal human CD34+ cord blood cells and primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples to determine the effect of venetoclax and vosaroxin on normal hematopoietic and leukemic progenitor cells. RESULTS: We found that venetoclax and vosaroxin synergistically induced apoptosis in multiple acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Although vosaroxin could partially abrogate the increase of Mcl-1 protein induced by venetoclax, it could not abrogate the increased binding of Bim to Mcl-1 induced by venetoclax. Cooperative induction of DNA damage occurred within 8 h of treatment with venetoclax plus vosaroxin. Moreover, repair of DNA damage induced by vosaroxin was significantly attenuated by venetoclax. The combination also synergistically induced apoptosis in primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples and significantly reduced the colony formation capacity of acute myeloid leukemia progenitor cells, while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Vosaroxin and venetoclax synergistically induce apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells and cooperatively target acute myeloid leukemia progenitor cells while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our results support the clinical testing of vosaroxin in combination with venetoclax for treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, especially in the elderly population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that the percentage of cells in S phase was higher with GM-CSF than with G-CSF treatment at 20 ng/mL (P < 0.05). When THP-1 and SHI-1 cells were primed with 20 ng/mL G-CSF or GM-CSF followed by Ara-C and ACR, cell proliferation rate in the CAGM (Ara-C, ACR, and GM-CSF) regimen was lower than in the CAG regimen (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CAGM regimen induced more obvious cell apoptosis than CAG regimen probably by reducing Bcl-2/Bax ratio (P < 0.05). Similar results were seen in primary cells from M5 patients.

Epub 2019 May 22.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and can be induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of the present study was to screen prognosisassociated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNAsequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene coexpression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DERNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosisassociated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNAmRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DERNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy. A 9lncRNA optimal combination [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 9, glucosidase, beta, acid 3 (GBA3), HLA complex group 4, Nacetyltransferase 8B, neighbor of breast cancer 1 gene 2, prostate androgenregulated transcript 1, ret finger protein like 1 antisense RNA 1, solute carrier family 22 member 18 antisense and Tcell leukemia/lymphoma 6] was selected from the 14 prognosisassociated lncRNAs, and was further supported by the validation dataset, GSE10186. The lncRNAmRNA coexpression network revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis. A risk score system was established based on the optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients with HBVpositive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. On the contrary, a larger, independent cohort of patients is required to further validate the riskscore system.",,PMC6579967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"A t(9;22) chromosomal translocation which forms the chimeric tyrosine kinase breakpoint cluster region (BCR)Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) is a key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Pharmacological inhibition of BCRABL with imatinib (Gleevec) has been reported as an effective targeted therapy; however, mutations (including the kinase domain of ABL) suppress the efficacy of inhibitors. PF114, a derivative of the third generation BCRABL inhibitor ponatinib, demonstrated a high inhibitory activity against wild-type and mutant BCRABL forms, such as the clinically important T315I. Furthermore, PF114 exhibited preferential kinase selectivity, safety, notable pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in a murine model. Investigation into the mechanisms of CML cell death revealed an exceptional potency of PF114 (at low nanomolar concentrations) for the CMLderived K562 cell line, whereas leukemia cell lines that lack the chimeric tyrosine kinase were markedly more refractory. The molecular ordering of events mechanistically associated with K562 cell death included the dephosphorylation of CrkL adaptor protein followed by inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt, G1 arrest, a decrease of phosphorylated Bcl2associated death promoter, Bcl2like protein 11, BH3 interactingdomain death agonist, Bclextra large and Bcl2 family apoptosis regulator, and reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Increased Annexin V reactivity, activation of caspases and poly(ADPribose)polymerase cleavage were proposed to lead to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, PF114 may be a potent inducer of apoptosis in CML cells. Nevertheless, activation of STAT3 phosphorylation in response to PF114 may permit cell rescue; thus, a combination of BCRABL and STAT3 inhibitors should be considered for improved therapeutic outcome. Collectively, the targeted killing of BCRABLpositive cells, along with other beneficial properties, such as in vivo characteristics, suggests PF114 as a potential candidate for analysis in clinical trials with CML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Socio-economic factors and distance of their residence from the hospital may contribute to this disparity. This study was aimed at identifying the impact of these factors on outcome in childhood ALL. Methods: : In this retrospective study, file review of children with ALL was performed. Patients were treated with the modified United Kingdom (UK) ALL-2003 protocol. Details of socio-economic/demographic factors were noted from a web-based patients' database. Modified Kuppuswamy scale was used to classify socio-economic status. Results: : A total of 308 patients with a median age of five years (range: 1-13 yr) were studied. Patients belonging to upper, middle and lower SE strata numbered 85 (28%), 68 (22%) and 155 (50%). Nearly one-third of the patients were underweight. There was no treatment abandonment among children whose mothers were graduates. Neutropenic deaths during maintenance therapy were lower in mothers who had passed high school. In patients who survived induction therapy, the five year event-free survival (EFS) of upper SE stratum was significantly better 78.7+/-4.9 vs. 59+/-7.2 and 58.1+/-4.6 per cent in middle and lower strata (P =0.026). Five year overall survival was higher in the higher SE group; being 91.2+/-3.5, 78.3+/-5.6 and 78.8+/-3.9 per cent (P =0.055) in the three strata. Survival was unaffected by a distance of residence from treating centre or rural/urban residence. High-risk and undernourished children had a greater hazard of mortality [1.80 (P =0.015); 1.98 (P =0.027)]. Interpretation & conclusions: : Our findings showed that higher socio-economic status contributed to superior EFS in children with ALL who achieved remission. Undernutrition increased the risk of mortality.",,PMC6507537,,['NOTNLM'],"['Area remoteness', 'childhood leukaemia', 'demographic factors', 'illiteracy', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment default', 'treatment-related mortality']",,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cytoplasm, pre-60S ribosomal particles are converted to translation-competent large ribosomal subunits. Here, we present the mechanism of peptidyltransferase centre (PTC) completion that explains how integration of the last ribosomal proteins is coupled to release of the nuclear export adaptor Nmd3. Single-particle cryo-EM reveals that eL40 recruitment stabilises helix 89 to form the uL16 binding site. The loading of uL16 unhooks helix 38 from Nmd3 to adopt its mature conformation. In turn, partial retraction of the L1 stalk is coupled to a conformational switch in Nmd3 that allows the uL16 P-site loop to fully accommodate into the PTC where it competes with Nmd3 for an overlapping binding site (base A2971). Our data reveal how the central functional site of the ribosome is sculpted and suggest how the formation of translation-competent 60S subunits is disrupted in leukaemia-associated ribosomopathies.","['12048/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'STE 2517/1-1/German Science Foundation Emmy Noether Foundation/International', 'P 29451/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P29451/Austrian Science Foundation FWF Grants/International', 'P26136/Austrian Science Foundation FWF Grants/International', 'Emmy Noether Programme STE 2517/1-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'Collaborative Research Center 969 Project A06/Deutsche', 'Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', '108466/Z/15/Z/Wellcome/International', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105184326/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_1201/14/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'FWF Grants P26136/Fonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung/International', 'FWF Grants P29451/Fonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung/International', 'MC_U105161083/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '969 Project A06/Collaborative Research Center/International', 'MR/L003368/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC6579518,,['NOTNLM'],"['*S. cerevisiae', '*SBDS', '*Shwachman-Diamond syndrome', '*cryo-EM', '*leukaemia', '*molecular biophysics', '*ribosome', '*ribosomopathy', '*structural biology']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8588-7285', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8201-5884', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7735-6070', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0742-9734', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1447-4509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7724-309X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9277-4553']","['(c) 2019, Kargas et al.']","['VK, PC, NE, KD, CH, CS, GZ, MM, SP, LW, SF, JW, AA, AF, EC, FS, HB, AW No', 'competing interests declared']",,"['PDB/6RZZ', 'PDB/6S05', 'PDB/6QIK', 'PDB/6QTZ', 'PDB/6RI5', 'PDB/6QT0']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worldwide estimates are around >500,000 CC diagnoses and >300,000 related deaths annually, and CC remains the second most devastating type of cancers in women after breast cancer. Although the vaccine against HPV has reduced the incidence of infection and the treatment efficacy of the early-stage diagnoses has improved, many challenges remain in terms of treatment efficacy, during the late-stage and prevention of chemotherapy resistance development. Thus, new tools for prompt diagnoses and more effective curative treatments (including the development of targeted gene therapies) are needed. The long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) (>200 nucleotides) are transcripts that do not encode for any proteins, and they have been linked to the development of cancers (such as leukemia and breast, colorectal, and liver cancers). Some lncRNAs have been identified as the cause of the dysregulation of the oncogenes and progression of CC, but these studies are still very preliminary. In this review, we explore the literature for lncRNAs involved in the development of CC and their signaling pathways to identify those that might serve as early diagnostic biomarkers, or as targets for gene therapy or other curative treatments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MicroRNA-125a mimic and negative control (NC) were constructed and transfected into AML cell line HL60, respectively. Cell viability of HL60 cells transfected with microRNA-125a mimic or NC was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Regulatory effects of microRNA-125a on enzyme activities of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-xl, caspase-3, and caspase-9 in HL60 cells were quantified by a spectrophotometry. Changes in apoptosis and invasion of HL60 cells overexpressing microRNA-125a were detected by flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. Protein levels of cell cycle genes (cyclin B, cdc-2, mdm-2), pro-apoptotic gene p53 and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in HL60 cells transfected with microRNA-125a mimic or NC were assessed by Western blot. Finally, the mRNA levels of Bax, caspase-8, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and c-myc in HL60 cells with microRNA-125a overexpression were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: MicroRNA-125a expression remarkably increased by transfection of microRNA-125a mimic into HL60 cells, suggesting its sufficient transfection efficacy. MTT assay revealed an inhibited viability after microRNA-125a overexpression. Transfection of microRNA-125a mimic markedly enhanced enzyme activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but reduced activities of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in HL60 cells than controls (p<0.05). Moreover, microRNA-125a overexpression elevated apoptotic rate as FCM data indicated. Transwell assay demonstrated a decrease in the invasive rate of HL60 cells overexpressing microRNA-125a. Western blot analyses revealed that cell cycle genes all downregulated by transfection of microRNA-125a mimic in HL60 cells. The protein level of p53 upregulated and Bcl-2 downregulated in HL60 cells overexpressing microRNA-125a (p<0.05). Furthermore, mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic genes Bax and caspase-8 were enhanced after microRNA-125a overexpression, while mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and c-myc were reduced (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-125a inhibits proliferative and invasive potentials, arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase of AML cells by regulating the NF-kappaB pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, we also investigated whether microRNA-199 could inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of AML cells by regulating caspase-3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of microRNA-199 in peripheral blood samples of AML patients and healthy controls was determined using Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Similarly, microRNA-199 expression was also detected in AML cells and human medullary cells. The overexpression plasmid of microRNA-199 was constructed and transfected into cells. Subsequently, the regulatory effects of microRNA-199 on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and migration were accessed. The relationship between microRNA-199 and caspase-3 expression was further elucidated by Western blot and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: MicroRNA-199 was lowly expressed in peripheral blood of AML patients and AML cell lines than normal controls. The overexpression of microRNA-199 significantly decreased proliferative, invasive and migratory capacities of AML cells, whereas markedly increased apoptotic rate. Western blot results showed that microRNA-199 increased caspase-3 expression in AML cells.

Case Report: A 37-year-old man with acute myelogenous leukemia who had received bone marrow transplantation four months prior was referred to our clinic with the chief complaint of gradually decreasing vision in both eyes for three months. During the funduscopic examination, multiple serous retinal detachments (SRD) were observed bilaterally, and he was diagnosed with multiple foci of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). He was advised to discontinue the steroid dosage, which did not make significant improvement, and he was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injection in the more severely affected eye. One month later, significant improvement was noticed in both eyes. Conclusion: Serous retinal detachment is a rare complication following BMT. Significant bilateral improvement after single unilateral intravitreal bevacizumab injection shows not only the possible role of increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in this case, but also the systemic diffusion of the drug and effect on the contralateral eye following unilateral injection.",,PMC6504720,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bevacizumab', 'Central Serous Chorioretinopathy', 'Serous Retinal Detachment', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4776-6989'],,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous observations suggest important skeletal muscle size, density and function deficits in ALL survivors. Purpose: Given that only a fraction of all patients will suffer from this particular complication, we investigated whether it could be predicted by genetic markers. Patients and methods: We analysed associations between skeletal muscle force (Fmax) and power (Pmax) and germline genetic variants from 1039 genes derived through whole-exome sequencing. Top-ranking association signals retained after correction for multiple testing were confirmed through genotyping, and further analysed through stratified analyses and multivariate models. Results: Our results show that skeletal muscle function deficit is associated with two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2001616DUOX2, P=0.0002 (Pmax) and rs41270041ADAMTS4, P=0.02 (Fmax)) and two rare ones located in the ALOX15 gene (P=0.001 (Pmax)). These associations were further modulated by sex, body mass index and risk groups, which reflected glucocorticoid dose and radiation therapy (P</=0.02).

Results: Our data demonstrated that SMI-4a could inhibit the proliferation of A549 and Ltep-a-2 cells markedly in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Treatment with 80 mumol/L of SMI-4a for 48 h significantly induced the apoptosis rate of NSCLC cells (P<0.05), and blocked the cell cycle of NSCLC cells in G2/M phase (P<0.05). The phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in NSCLC cells were significantly downregulated by SMI-4a (P<0.05). Result from in vivo experiments demonstrated that SMI-4a could suppress the tumor growth in mouse models with NSCLC (P<0.05). Conclusions: SMI-4a suppresses the progression of NSCLC by blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",,PMC6497832,,['NOTNLM'],"['NSCLC', 'Pim-1', 'SMI-4a', 'tumor progression']",,,['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD40L is a type II transmembrane protein, which has been reported to have the potential to inhibit growth of some cancer cells. Materials and methods: In order to determine the role of CD40L on AML-M5 cell line THP-1, we overexpressed CD40L in the cells using a lentiviral vector system (pHBLV-CMVIE-Zs Green-T2A-puro vector); overexpression was confirmed by the detection of green fluorescent protein and CD40L protein expression. Results: Cellular apoptosis, proliferation, and cycle assays showed that CD40L could promote the apoptosis of, suppress the proliferation of, and stimulate the arrest of the G1/S phase of THP-1 cells. Finally, the protein expression of P53, Bax/Bcl-2, cyclinD1, PCNA, PTEN, and p-Akt illustrated that CD40L may partly influence cell growth of THP-1 cells through those genes, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and a PI3K/Akt activator. Conclusion: Taken together, CD40L could inhibit cell growth of THP-1 cells through the PI3K/Akt pathway, indicating that the overexpression of CD40L may be a potential target to treat the AML-M5 disease.",,PMC6476227,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-M5', 'CD40L', 'P53', 'PCNA', 'cell apoptosis', 'cell proliferation', 'cyclinD1', 'tumor suppressor']",,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,['Onco Targets Ther. 2019 May 28;12:4223.

Multiple clinical trials have proved that it is effective in relapsed or refractory AML with an FLT3-ITD mutation. In this review, we focus on the characteristics of FLT3/ITD mutations, the mechanism and pharmacokinetics of quizartinib, and the mechanisms of resistance to quizartinib. We also summarize clinical experiences and adverse effects with quizartinib and recommend crucial approaches of quizartinib in the therapy of patients with newly diagnosed AML and patients with relapsed/refractory AML, particularly those with FLT3-ITD mutation. Quizartinib presents its advantages as a very promising agent in the treatment of AML, especially in patients with FLT3-ITD mutations. FLT3/ITD mutation can lead to constitutive autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activation of its downstream effectors including RAS/RAF/MEK, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT5 signal pathways, while Quizartinib can inhibit these downstream pathways through specific FLT3 inhibition. Quizartinib has received US Food and Drug Administration breakthrough therapy designation in patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD AML based on clinical trials. A larger sample of clinical trials are needed to verify its safety and efficacy, and the efficacy of quizartinib combined with chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should also be estimated in clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to characterize the impact of spaceflight on secondary lymphoid organs at the molecular level. We analysed the spleens and lymph nodes from mice flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in orbit for 35 days, as part of a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency mission. During flight, half of the mice were exposed to 1 g by centrifuging in the ISS, to provide information regarding the effect of microgravity and 1 g exposure during spaceflight. Whole-transcript cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the spleen suggested that erythrocyte-related genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA1 were significantly down-regulated in ISS-flown vs. ground control mice. GATA1 and Tal1 (regulators of erythropoiesis) mRNA expression was consistently reduced by approximately half. These reductions were not completely alleviated by 1 g exposure in the ISS, suggesting that the combined effect of space environments aside from microgravity could down-regulate gene expression in the spleen. Additionally, plasma immunoglobulin concentrations were slightly altered in ISS-flown mice.

In this study, we show that the orally bioavailable XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 reduced Mcl-1 protein level, by which it synergized with Bcl-xL inhibitor A-1331852 to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. KPT-330/A-1331852 combination disrupted bindings of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL to Bax, Bak, and/or Bim, elicited mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and triggered apoptosis. KPT-330 generally mitigated mRNA expression and protein synthesis rather than mRNA nuclear export or protein stability of Mcl-1. KPT-330 inhibited mTORC1/4E-BP1 and Mnk1/eIF4E axes, which disrupted the eIF4F translation initiation complex but was dispensable for Mcl-1 reduction and KPT-330/A-1331852 combination-induced apoptosis. Mature rRNAs are integral components of the ribosome that determines protein synthesis ability. KPT-330 impeded nucleolar rRNA processing and reduced total levels of multiple mature rRNAs. Reconstitution of XPO1 by expressing degradation-resistant C528S mutant retained rRNA amount, Mcl-1 expression, and Bcl-xL inhibitor resistance upon KPT-330 treatment. KPT-330/A-1331852 combination suppressed growth and enhanced apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer xenografts.

Calicheamicin a key element of GO, induces DNA-damage and cell-death once the linked CD33-antibody facilitates its uptake. Calicheamicin efflux by the drug-transporter PgP-1 have been implicated in GO response thus in this study, we evaluated impact of ABCB1-SNPs on GO response. Genomic-DNA samples from 942 patients randomized to receive standard therapy with or without addition of GO (COG-AAML0531) were genotyped for ABCB1-SNPs. Our most interesting results show that for rs1045642, patients with minor-T-allele (CT/TT) had better outcome as compared to patients with CC genotype in GO-arm (Event-free survival-EFS: p = 0.022; and risk of relapse-RR, p = 0.007). In contrast, no difference between genotypes was observed for any of the clinical endpoints within No-GO arm (all p > 0.05). Consistent results were obtained when genotype groups were compared by GO and No-GO arms. The in vitro evaluation using HL60-cells further demonstrated consistent impact of rs1045642-T-allele on calicheamicin induced DNA-damage and cell-viability. Our results show the significance of ABCB1 SNPs on GO response in AML and warrants the need to investigate this in other cohorts. Once validated, ABCB1-SNPs in conjunction with CD33-SNPs can open up opportunities to personalize GO-therapy.","['R01 CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6529443,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0411-0007'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NSCLC shows serious effect on prognosis for drug resistance, and it is necessary to study the molecular mechanism for drug resistance in NSCLC. Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) can regulate some important cellular processes by degrading short-term protein, and the abnormal expression is closely related to the occurrence, development and prognosis of tumor. The F-box family protein is an important component of the ubiquitin proteasome, such as cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, apoptosis and differentiation. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (FBXW7) is just the classic protein components among F-box family protein. Studies have shown that FBXW7 is related to drug resistance in NSCLC. The main mechanism is that FBXW7 mutation leads to drug resistance by reducing ubiquitination and degradation of its downstream proteins, including Snail protein, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and coiled-coil-domain containing 6 (CCDC6). Rapamycin, histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275, and rabdosia are effective in drug-resistant NSCLC patients with FBXW7 mutation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 21.,"We present a case of a patient with multiply relapsed, refractory myeloma whose clinical course showed evidence of a synergistic abscopal-like response to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and localized radiotherapy (XRT). Shortly after receiving B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted CAR T-cell therapy, the patient required urgent high-dose steroids and XRT for spinal cord compression. Despite the steroids, the patient had a durable systemic response that could not be attributed to XRT alone. Post-XRT findings included a second wave of fever and increased CRP and IL6, beginning 21 days after CAR T cells, which is late for cytokine-release syndrome from CAR T-cell therapy alone on this trial. Given this response, which resembled cytokine-release syndrome, immediately following XRT, we investigated changes in the patient's T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire over 10 serial time points. Comparing T-cell diversity via Morisita's overlap indices (CD ), we discovered that, although the diversity was initially stable after CAR T-cell therapy compared with baseline (CD = 0.89-0.97, baseline vs. 4 time points after CAR T cells), T-cell diversity changed after the conclusion of XRT, with >30% newly expanded TCRs (CD = 0.56-0.69, baseline vs. 4 time points after XRT). These findings suggest potential synergy between radiation and CAR T-cell therapies resulting in an abscopal-like response.","['U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA190174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA184746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6606365,['NIHMS1528833'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0296-7587', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8680-4373', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5248-9117', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2892-2643', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9423-4059']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 18.,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive agent that is widely used in graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis because of its inhibitory function on T cells and B cells. However, the effect of MMF on natural killer cell reconstitution after allogenic hematological transplantation is largely unknown. The present study examined the effects of different MMF administration durations after haploidentical allo-HSCT on NK cell reconstitution. Ninety patients were enrolled in this study and defined into two groups in term of MMF duration. We found that MMF patients in the long-term MMF group were associated with a poor reconstitution of NK cells and a significantly lower cytotoxicity from day 30 to day 180 post-transplantation. Especially, the long-term MMF group inhibits reconstitution of NKp30 NK subsets, which correlated with higher risk of EBV viremia. Multivariate analysis showed that a better reconstitution of NKp30 cells was associated with lower EBV viremia (HR0.957, p=.04). In vitro experiments demonstrated that the active metabolite of MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), inhibited the proliferation and cytotoxicity of NK cells from healthy donors or patients at day 30 post-transplantation. In summary, our findings demonstrated that long-term MMF administration delayed the quality and quantity of NK cells, especially NKp30 subpopulations, which was associated with decreased EBV viremia post allogeneic HSCT.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allo-HSCT', '*MMF', '*NK cells', '*NKp30', '*Reconstitution']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 18.,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy marked by the accumulation of large numbers of immature myeloblasts in bone marrow. The overall prognosis in AML is poor; hence, there is a pressing need to improve treatment. Although the sphingolipid (SL) ceramide demonstrates known cancer suppressor properties, it's mechanism of action is multifaceted. Our studies in leukemia and other cancers have demonstrated that when combined with the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, the apoptosis-inducting effect of ceramide is greatly enhanced. The goal of the present study was to establish whether a ceramide-tamoxifen regimen also affects autophagic-driven cellular responses in leukemia. Using the human AML cell line KG-1, we demonstrate that, unlike exposure to the single agents, combination C6-ceramide-tamoxifen upregulated LC3-II expression, inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway, and synergistically induced KG-1cell death in an Atg5-dependent manner. In addition, colocalization of autophagosome and mitochondria, indicative of mitophagosome formation and mitophagy, was observed. Versatility of the drug regimen was confirmed by experiments in MV4-11cells, a FLT3-ITD AML mutant. These results indicate that the C6-ceramide-tamoxifen regimen plays a pivotal role inducing autophagy in AML, and thus constitutes a novel therapeutic design.",['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6909922,['NIHMS1059647'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*Ceramide', '*Leukemia', '*Mitophagy', '*Sphingolipids', '*Tamoxifen']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This is particularly true when diseases have highly heterogeneous presentations and prognoses, as in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). Although machine learning methods can readily learn complex nonlinear relationships, many methods are criticized as inadequate because of limited interpretability. We propose using unsupervised clustering of the continuous output of machine learning models to provide discrete risk stratification for predicting time to first treatment in a cohort of patients with CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 737 treatment-naive patients with CLL diagnosed at Mayo Clinic were included in this study. We compared predictive abilities for two survival models (Cox proportional hazards and random survival forest) and four classification methods (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting machine). Probability of treatment was then stratified. RESULTS: Machine learning methods did not yield significantly more accurate predictions of time to first treatment. However, automated risk stratification provided by clustering was able to better differentiate patients who were at risk for treatment within 1 year than models developed using standard survival analysis techniques. CONCLUSION: Clustering the posterior probabilities of machine learning models provides a way to better interpret machine learning models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 21.,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that respond rapidly to a number of stressors to regulate energy transduction, cell death signaling, and reactive oxygen species generation. We hypothesized that mitochondrial remodeling, comprising both structural and functional alterations, following ionizing radiation (IR) may underlie some of the tenets of radiobiology. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are precursors of bone marrow stroma and are altered in acute myeloid leukemia and by radiation and chemotherapy. Here, we report on changes in mitochondrial remodeling in human MSCs following X-ray IR. Mitochondrial function was significantly increased in MSCs 4 h after IR as measured by mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Consistent with this elevated functional effect, electron transport chain supercomplexes were also increased in irradiated samples. In addition, mitochondria were significantly, albeit modestly, elongated, as measured by high-throughput automated confocal imaging coupled with automated mitochondrial morphometric analyses. We also demonstrate in fibroblasts that mitochondrial remodeling is required for the adaptation of cells to IR. To determine novel mechanisms involved in mitochondrial remodeling, we performed quantitative proteomics on isolated mitochondria from cells following IR. Label-free quantitative mitochondrial proteomics revealed notable changes in proteins in irradiated samples and identified prosaposin, and potentially its daughter protein saposin-B, as a potential candidate for regulating mitochondrial function following IR. Whereas research into the biologic effects of cellular irradiation has long focused on nuclear DNA effects, our experimental work, along with that of others, is finding that mitochondrial effects may have broader implications in the field of stress adaptation and cell death in cancer (including leukemia) and other disease states.-Patten, D.

Epub 2019 May 21.,"INTRODUCTION: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) is important in diagnosis, therapy, monitoring of post-transplant bone marrow, and prognosis assessment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, due to the nature of ALL, CC often encounters difficulties of complex karyotype, poor chromosome morphology, low mitotic index, or normal cells dividing only. In contrast, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) showed a specificity >99% and a sensitivity of 100% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Here, we report our experience with CMA on adult ALL patients. METHODS: Thirty-three bone marrow/blood samples from ALL patients (aged 18-79 years, median 44) at diagnosis/relapse, analyzed by CC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were recruited. Chromosomal microarray analysis results were compared with CC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, if available, was applied when there was a discrepancy. RESULTS: Copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) was found in 8 cases (24.2%). Only CN-LOH at 9p was recurrent (3 cases, 9.1%). Copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected in 6 of 9 cases (66.7%) with normal karyotypes, in 3 of 5 cases (60.0%) with sole ""balanced"" translocations, and in 18 of 19 cases (94.7%) with complex karyotypes. Common CNAs involved CDKN2A/2B (30.3%), IKZF1 (27.3%), PAX5 (9.1%), RB1 (9.1%), BTG1 (6.7%), and ETV6 (6.7%), which regulate cell cycle, B lymphopoiesis, or act as tumor suppressors in ALL. Copy number alteration detection rate by CMA was 81.8% (27 of 33 cases) as compared to 57.6% (19 of 33 cases) by CC. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of CMA as a routine clinical test at the time of diagnosis/relapse, in conjunction with CC and/or FISH, is highly recommended.",['1191100/CFO/CFO Fund'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['a single assay', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cryptic aberrations', 'microarray', 'routine']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8570-8467'],['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 21.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a spectrum of heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell diseases, vary in clinical severity, response to therapy, and propensity toward progression to acute myeloid leukemia. These are acquired clonal disorders resulting from somatic mutations within the hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell population. Understanding the natural history and the risk of developing leukemia and other adverse outcomes is dependent on access to well-annotated biospecimens linked to robust clinical and molecular data. To facilitate the acquisition and distribution of MDS biospecimens to the wider scientific community and support scientific discovery in this disease, the National MDS Natural History study was initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and is being conducted in collaboration with community hospitals and academic medical centers supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The study will recruit up to 2000 MDS patients or overlapping myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) and up to 500 cases of idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS). The National MDS Natural History Study (NCT02775383) will offer the world's largest disease-focused tissue biobank linked to longitudinal clinical and molecular data in MDS. Here, we report on the study design features and describe the vanguard phase of 200 cases. The study assembles a comprehensive clinical database, quality of life results, laboratory data, histopathology slides and images, genetic information, hematopoietic and germline tissues representing high-quality biospecimens and data from diverse centers across the United States.

A recent finding suggests that the high BRE gene expression in MLL-AF9 AML could be attributed to the additional expression of a transcript variant encoding a novel C-terminal BRE isoform. Using THP-1 as the MLL-AF9 AML cell model, we found that ectopic expression of the C-terminal BRE, which could not form an intact BRCA1-A complex, indeed increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and inhibited cell proliferation, while the complete opposite was achieved by the ectopic expression of full-length BRE.

Strategies for mitigating anthracycline cardiotoxicity, methods of establishing baseline CV risk and utilization of clinical pharmacists were also assessed. Results indicate that it is common for AL patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy to require CV medication interruptions. This highlights the need for collaboration between hematology and cardiology healthcare teams and utilization of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals to improve CV care during AL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardio-oncology', '*cardiotoxicity', '*hematologist', '*prescribing practice']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2570-515X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: this analysis aim to evaluate tumour incidence and overall mortality among Italian soldiers sent on a mission abroad (period 1996-2012; 3,663 cases). This investigation is preliminary to a more complete retrospective study on the cohort of soldiers affected by tumour (No. 6,104 cases) diagnosed in the period 1973-2017 and registered by the Epidemiological Defence Observatory (OED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: cohort data were acquired by the Uranium Commission of the Chamber of Deputies (CUC, 2016-2018). For statistical and epidemiological reasons, mainly dictated by the number, completeness, and quality of information concerning patients (or deceased) and the study population. The survey was temporarily limited to male military aged between 20 and 59 during the period 1996-2012 (No. 3,663; 60% of the total). Military from the four Italian defence forces - Air force, Carabinieri, Army, and Navy - were, respectively, divided into two groups: those involved in at least one mission abroad (""missionaries""; No. 874; 24%) and all the others (""non-missionaries""; No. 2,789; 76%). Using the method of indirect rate standardization, the age-standardized incidence ratio comparing missionaries and non-missionaries (SIRm) and comparing missionaries and the general population considered as an external reference (SIR) were calculated, with respective 90% confidence intervals (95%CI). Similarly, the overall mortality risk among missionaries was investigated. RESULTS: considering the population of the non-missionaries, the analysis of tumour incidence (TM) by military forces identified excesses in the missionaries of the Air Force (SIRm: 126.7; 90% CI 107.9-147.9), Carabinieri (SIRm: 152.8; 90%CI 134.0-173.7), and the Army (SIRm: 116.2; 90%CI 108.1-125.6). Taking into account missionaries, there was an excess of risk for specific neoplasia: for hemolymphopoietic system in Carabinieri (SIRm: 150.1; 90%CI 106.0 - 207.1) and in the Army (SIRm: 109.0; 90%CI 93.9-125.9); for Hodgkin lymphoma in Air force (SIRm: 187.7; 90%CI 88.1-352.5), Carabinieri (SIRm: 187.3; 90%CI 87.9-351.8), and the Army (SIRm; 104.5; 90%CI 81.2-132.6); for leukaemia in the Army (SIRm: 142.4; 90%CI 107.5-185.4). Significant risk excesses were also observed in missionaries for stomach, testis, kidney, bladder, and thyroid tumours. On the other hand, for missionaries in the Navy, a statistically significant risk reduction for all tumours emerged (SIRm: 61.1; IC90% 51.0-72.6). Missionaries showed a higher mortality for all causes. CONCLUSIONS: this preliminary study confirms the need for an in-depth survey on the health status of Italian soldiers. In particular, the risk for diseases, even non-neoplastic and after 2012, should be investigated in the military over the age of 60, who has a greater risk of incidence and mortality, not only for tumour. All potential disease determinants, both environmental and personal, should also be studied.",,,,,,,,,,,Incidenza di tumori maligni (1996-2012) in giovani militari italiani inviati in missione all'estero.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between GSTs polymorphisms and CML risk, treatment response. METHODS: We genotyped GSTM1, GSTT1 null deletion polymorphisms, and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism by PCR methods and BCR-ABL transcripts were analyzed by qRT-PCR in 104 CML patients and 104 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: Individual analysis showed significant association of GSTM1 (p = 0.008; OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26-0.82) and GSTP1 genes (p = 0.04; OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.016-2.423) with CML risk.

The proportion of CML cancer attributable to the interaction of smoking and GSTM1 null, GSTT1null, and GSTP1 M* was 42%, 39%, and 13%, respectively. Patients with GSTM1-null and GSTP1 AG/GG genotype had significantly a lower rate of MMR achievement (p = 0.00; p = 0.009 respectively). Event-free survival (EFS) percentage was similar between GSTM1 null and GSTM1 present patients (p = 0.21).

Epub 2019 May 20.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse, requiring re-treatment and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although achieving second complete remission (CR2) prior to HSCT is desirable, once CR2 is attained, it is unclear if there is any benefit from further chemotherapy prior to HSCT. Moreover, although pre-HSCT minimal residual disease (MRD) has prognostic value in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the benefit of MRD reduction after achieving CR prior to HSCT is less clear for AML. PROCEDURE: To address these questions, we analyzed data from pediatric transplant centers in Australia and New Zealand concerning relapsed childhood AML cases occurring between 1998 and 2013. Given the retrospective nature of our analysis and assay data available, we analyzed patients on the basis of measurable residual disease (MeRD) by any methodology, rather than MRD in the conventional sense. RESULTS: We observed improved overall survival (OS) in children receiving two chemotherapy cycles, compared to one cycle or three or more cycles pre-HSCT. Improved OS with two cycles remained significant for patients without MeRD after cycle 1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a second chemotherapy cycle pre-HSCT may improve survival by lowering disease burden. Prospective trials assessing strategies to reduce pre-HSCT MRD in relapsed childhood AML are warranted.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MRD', '*chemotherapy', '*pediatric', '*relapse', '*transplant']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8062-1779'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: SS-13(BN) and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats were divided into 3 groups: SS-13(BN) group (control group, n=9), DS group (model group, n=9) and GS group (Guizhi Decoction, n=9). After 10 weeks of a high-salt diet, the GS group rats were given Guizhi Decoction and other two groups were given saline at an equal volume as a vehicle. After 4 weeks' intragastric administration, rats were executed to detect the relevant indicators. Echocardiography and plasma n-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were used to assess cardiac function. Noradrenaline (NA) levels in the plasma and myocardium were detected to evaluate the sympathetic function. NGF and LIF expression were detected in the myocardium by Western blot or quantitative real-time PCR. Double immunofluorescence or Western blot was used to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) in order to reflect anatomical and functional changes of sympathetic nerves. RESULTS: DS group had anatomical and functional deterioration of sympathetic nerves in the decompensation period of heart failure compared with SS-13(BN) group. Compared with the DS group, Guizhi Decoction significantly decreased the expression of LIF mRNA/protein (P<0.01), increased the expression of NGF (P<0.05 or P<0.01), enhanced the levels of TH+/GAP43+ and TH+/CHAT+ positive nerve fibers (P<0.01), and improved the protein expression of TH and GAP43 in left ventricle, but had no effect on CHAT (P>0.05). Guizhi Decoction inhibited inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition of myocardial injury, increased the content of myocardial NA (P<0.05), reduced the plasma NA level (P<0.01), improved cardiac function (P<0.01), and improved weight and blood pressure to some extent (P<0.05), compared with DS group. CONCLUSIONS: Guizhi Decoction could inhibit cholinergic transdifferentiation of sympathetic nerves, improve the anatomical and functional denervation of sympathetic nerves, and delay the progression of decompensated heart failure. The mechanism may be associated with the correction of the imbalance of NGF and LIF.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Guizhi Decoction', 'cholinergic transdifferentiation', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'nerve growth factor', 'sympathetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 20.,"The development of allogeneic hematopoietic-stem-cell transplantation has improved the prognosis of younger acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, the outcome of older AML patients remains poor. The majority of AML patients are elderly. For elderly AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy, less toxic single agent that targets a specific gene mutation or combination therapy with a single agent is needed. The role of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations in leukemia has become more apparent, and detailed prognostic stratification based on the type of genetic mutation has been established. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used for gene analysis of AML. In the future, the evaluation of biologically homogeneous population on the basis of chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations will lead to a paradigm shift that will help in the development of optimized therapy. As rapid diagnosis of gene mutations is required by the clinical physicians to decide on induction therapy, it is important to have a swift turnaround time for comprehensive DNA sequencing to provide actionable data to clinical physicians. It is required to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the turnaround time from sending the specimens to receiving the results while maintaining the quality of the specimens contributing to gene analysis. To detect infrequent gene mutations, investigators need to perform multicenter studies and/or cooperative-group trials with a certain sample size to examine the frequency of the gene mutations in elderly AML patients, enabling sufficient statistical power for meaningful comparisons.",,PMC6597606,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'Precision medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 20.,"PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is suggested to be therapeutically beneficial in combination with interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) in various cancers. Therefore, we examined IFNalpha and VPA alone and in combinations in selected AML models, examining immune regulators and intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in phospho-proteomics. METHODS: The anti-leukemic effects of IFNalpha and VPA were examined in vitro and in vivo. We mapped the in vitro phosphoprotein modulation by IFNalpha-2b and human IFNalpha-Le in MOLM-13 cells by IMAC/2D DIGE/MS analysis and phospho-flow cytometry, and in primary healthy and AML patient-derived PBMCs by CyTOF. In vivo, IFNalpha-Le and VPA efficacy were investigated in the immunodeficient NOD/Scid IL2gamma-/- MOLM-13(Luc+) mouse model and the syngeneic immunocompetent BNML rat model. RESULTS: IFNalpha-2b and IFNalpha-Le differed in the modulation of phospho-proteins involved in protein folding, cell stress, cell death and p-STAT6 Y641, whereas VPA and IFNalpha-Le shared signaling pathways involving phosphorylation of Akt (T308), ERK1/2 (T202/T204), p38 (T180/Y182), and p53 (S15). Both IFNalpha compounds induced apoptosis synergistically with VPA in vitro. However, in vivo, VPA monotherapy increased survival, but no benefit was observed by IFNalpha-Le treatment. CyTOF analysis of primary human PBMCs indicated that lack of immune-cell activation could be a reason for the absence of response to IFNalpha in the animal models investigated. CONCLUSIONS: IFNalpha-2b and IFNalpha-Le showed potent and synergistic anti-leukemic effects with VPA in vitro but not in leukemic mouse and rat models in vivo. The absence of IFNalpha immune activation in lymphocyte subsets may potentially explain the limited in vivo anti-leukemic effect of IFNalpha-monotherapy in AML.","['104712/Kreftforeningen', '145268/Kreftforeningen', '145269/Kreftforeningen', '163424/Kreftforeningen', '_/Trond Mohn Foundation', '912160/Helse Vest (NO)']",PMC6571093,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CyTOF', 'IFNalpha', 'Phospho-flow', 'Phosphoproteome', 'VPA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-9704'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our group tested 1000 original MeOH extracts from natural sources, such as plants and food ingredients using six types of mutant yeasts. In our experiments, Kuji amber was used as the rare domestic natural source and the growth-restoring activity (positive screening) of mutant yeast involving Ca(2+)-signal transduction was used as a unique screening method. A prominent new anti-allergy compound, named kujigamberol (15,20-dinor-5,7,9-labdatrien-18-ol) was isolated from Kuji amber and known compounds already isolated from modern plants were identified in Baltic and Dominican ambers. Kujigamberol and the methanol extract of Kuji amber (MEKA) exerted inhibitory activity against the degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells through the inhibition of Ca(2+)-influx and inhibited the production of leukotriene C4 (LTC4). The effects of kujigamberol and MEKA on rhinitis model were approximately five times more potent than those of the mometasone furoate. Thus, the combination of rare natural sources and unique mutant yeasts can yield valuable bioprobes as novel drug candidates and/or basic research reagents, to benefit humankind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) was achieved in 24 of 30 patients (80%) that could be evaluated on day 30 after infusion, which accounted for 70.5% of all 34 enrolled patients. Most patients only experienced mild cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Seven CR patients received no further treatment, and 3 of them remained in remission at 6, 6.6, and 14 months after infusion. Eleven CR patients were promptly bridged to transplantation, and 8 of them remained in remission at 4.6 to 13.3 months after transplantation, resulted in 1-year leukemia-free survival rate of 71.6% (95% CI, 44.2-99.0).

Published studies have mostly used second-generation CARs with 4-1BB or CD28 as costimulatory domains. Preclinical results of third-generation CARs incorporating both elements have shown superiority concerning longevity and proliferation. The University Hospital of Heidelberg is the first institution to run an investigator-initiated trial (IIT) CAR T cell trial (Heidelberg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell Trial number 1 [HD-CAR-1]) in Germany with third-generation CD19-directed CAR T cells. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adult patients with r/r ALL (stratum I), r/r NHL including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma (stratum II) as well as paediatric patients with r/r ALL (stratum III) will be treated with autologous T-lymphocytes transduced by third-generation RV-SFG.CD19.CD28.4-1BB zeta retroviral vector (CD19.CAR T cells). The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of escalating CD19.CAR T cell doses (1-20x10(6) transduced cells/m(2)) after lymphodepletion with fludarabine (flu) and cyclophosphamide (cyc). Patients will be monitored for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, i.e. CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) and/or other toxicities (primary objectives). Secondary objectives include evaluation of in vivo function and survival of CD19.CAR T cells and assessment of CD19.CAR T cell antitumour efficacy.HD-CAR-1 as a prospective, monocentric trial aims to make CAR T cell therapy accessible to patients in Europe. Currently, HD-CAR-1 is the first and only CAR T cell IIT in Germany. A third-generation Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade retroviral vector, a broad spectrum of NHL, treatment of paediatric and adult ALL patients and inclusion of patients even after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) make this trial unique. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval and approvals from the local and federal competent authorities were granted. Trial results will be reported via peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and scientific meetings.

Epub 2019 May 20.,"PURPOSE: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy targeting CD22 induces remission in 70% of patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the majority of post-CD22 CART remissions are short and associated with reduction in CD22 expression. We evaluate the implications of low antigen density on the activity of CD22 CART and propose mechanisms to overcome antigen escape. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using ALL cell lines with variable CD22 expression, we evaluate the cytokine profile, cytotoxicity, and in vivo CART functionality in the setting of low CD22 expression. We develop a high-affinity CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as an approach to improve CAR sensitivity. We also assess Bryostatin1, a therapeutically relevant agent, to upregulate CD22 and improve CAR functionality. RESULTS: We demonstrate that low CD22 expression negatively impacts in vitro and in vivo CD22 CART functionality and impairs in vivo CART persistence. Moreover, low antigen expression on leukemic cells increases naive phenotype of persisting CART. Increasing CAR affinity does not improve response to low-antigen leukemia. Bryostatin1 upregulates CD22 on leukemia and lymphoma cell lines for 1 week following single-dose exposure, and improves CART functionality and in vivo persistence. While Bryostatin1 attenuates IFNgamma production by CART, overall in vitro and in vivo CART cytotoxicity is not adversely affected. Finally, administration of Bryostain1 with CD22 CAR results in longer duration of in vivo response. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that target antigen modulation is a promising strategy to improve CD22 CAR efficacy and remission durability in patients with leukemia and lymphoma.See related commentary by Guedan and Delgado, p. 5188.","['ZIA BC011823/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011927/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8290499,['NIHMS1530013'],,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7445-3190', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5579-7625', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5966-8812', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2601-3665']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Sep 1;25(17):5188-5190.

Print 2019 Aug.,"Leukotoxin (LtxA) (trade name, Leukothera) is a protein secreted by the oral bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans A. actinomycetemcomitans is an oral pathogen strongly associated with development of localized aggressive periodontitis. LtxA acts as a virulence factor for A. actinomycetemcomitans by binding to the beta2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) on white blood cells (WBCs) and causing cell death. In addition, because of its specificity for malignant and activated WBCs, LtxA is being investigated as a therapeutic agent for treatment of hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the successful generation and characterization of Jurkat T lymphocytes with deletions in CD18, CD11a, and Fas that were engineered using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Using these clones, we demonstrate the specificity of LtxA for cells expressing LFA-1. We also demonstrate the requirement of the cell death receptor Fas for LtxA-mediated cell death in T lymphocytes. We show that LFA-1 and Fas are early events in the LtxA-mediated cell death cascade as caspase activation and mitochondrial perturbation do not occur in the absence of either receptor. To our knowledge, LtxA is the first molecule, other than FasL, known to require the Fas death receptor to initiate cell death. Knowledge of the mechanism of cell death induced by LtxA will facilitate the understanding of LtxA as a bacterial virulence factor and development of it as a potential therapeutic agent.","['R41 CA173900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI125185/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6652782,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR', '*autoimmunity', '*cell death', '*death receptor', '*inflammation', '*integrins', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*oral microbiology', '*periodontal disease']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 19.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with internal tandem duplication in fms-related tyrosine kinase receptor gene 3 (FLT3-ITD)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a dismal prognosis and the only curative option seems to be allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, its timing is still matter of debate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 73 consecutive AML patients with FLT3-ITD (median age 53, range 20-68 years) allografted with consistent policy to try to refer them all for upfront alloSCT in first complete remission (CR1). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 44 (range, 5-135) months the 5-year overall survival (OS)/disease-free survival (DFS) probabilities were 49%/47%. The cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 37% and 14%, respectively. The estimated 5-year OS for patients who received transplantation in CR1 was 62% versus 0% for patients who received transplantation beyond CR1. Multivariable analysis identified stem cell transplantation beyond CR1 as the key factor for poor OS (hazard ratio [HR], 5.41; P < .0001), DFS (HR, 4.41; P = .0002), and high relapse incidence (HR, 8.08; P < .0001). Acute graft versus host disease Grade >/=3 predicted higher NRM (HR, 3.80; P = .059) as well as inferior OS (HR, 2.04; P = .0079). No association of patient age, nucleophosmin status, donor type, conditioning, and other variables on the survival was detected. CONCLUSION: AlloSCT should be regarded with urgency as soon as CR1 is achieved in this subset of AML patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Allogeneic SCT', '*Complete remission', '*Donor', '*FLT3-ITD']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 17.,"BACKGROUND: Clinically validated prognostic models for overall survival do not exist for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who are on targeted therapies. We aimed to create a prognostic model to identify high-risk individuals who do not achieve a good outcome with available targeted therapies. METHODS: In this retrospective, pooled cohort study, 2475 patients with CLL treated between June 22, 2012, and Sept 23, 2015, in six randomised trials of ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax, or at the Mayo Clinic CLL Database (MCCD) were included. Eligible patients had CLL, were previously treated, were aged 18 years or older, had ECOG performance status 0-1, and required further treatment as per the international workshop on CLL 2008 criteria. There was heterogeneity in other eligibility criteria. We evaluated 28 candidate factors known to affect the overall survival of these patients and applied univariate and multivariate analyses to derive the risk score in a training dataset (n=727) of patients treated with ibrutinib or chemoimmunotherapy. We validated the score in an internal-validation dataset (n=242) of patients treated with ibrutinib or chemoimmunotherapy and three external-validation datasets (idelalisib or chemoimmunotherapy dataset, n=897; venetoclax or chemoimmunotherapy dataset, n=389; and the MCCD [including patients treated with heterogeneous therapies], n=220), applying C-statistics as a measure of discrimination. FINDINGS: The derived model consisted of four factors (one point each; serum beta2-microglobulin >/=5 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase >upper limit of normal, haemoglobin <110 g/L for women or <120 g/L for men, and time from initiation of last therapy <24 months), separating patients into low (score 0-1), intermediate (score 2-3), and high risk (score 4) groups. The risk score was prognostic for overall survival in the training dataset (CS=0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.85, log-rank p<0.0001), and in the internal-validation (CS=0.79, 0.56-0.97, log-rank p=0.0003), and all three external-validation cohorts (idelalisib or chemoimmunotherapy: CS=0.71, 0.59-0.81, log-rank p<0.0001; venetoclax or chemoimmunotherapy: CS =0.76, 0.66-0.85, log-rank p=0.014; MCCD cohort: CS=0.61, 0.56-0.66), log-rank p<0.0001). The risk score is available on Calculate by QxMD. INTERPRETATION: We present the first validated risk score to predict overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL treated with targeted therapy. The model is applicable to patients treated with all currently approved targeted therapies (ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax) and chemoimmunotherapy. This tool allows the identification of a well defined cohort of previously treated patients with CLL who are at high risk of death, and could be used in future prospective trials to test therapeutic options for these patients with an unmet clinical need.

Deterioration of hematopoietic integrity with age originates in part from the degraded functionality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we review recent findings identifying changes in metabolic programs and loss of epigenetic identity as major drivers of old HSC dysfunction and their role in promoting leukemia onset in the context of age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). We discuss how inflammatory and growth signals from the aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment contribute to cell-intrinsic HSC aging phenotypes and favor leukemia development. Finally, we address how metabolic, epigenetic, and inflammatory pathways could be targeted to enhance old HSC fitness and prevent leukemic transformation.","['F31 HL151140/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135763/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7657013,['NIHMS1644113'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Particularly in hematological malignancies, PIP4K2A was already described as an essential protein for a malignant phenotype, although the clinical and biological impact of PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C proteins have not being explored in the same extent. In the present study, we investigated the impact on clinical outcomes and gene network of PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C mRNA transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (2013) study. Our results indicate that PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, but not PIP4K2B, mRNA levels were significantly reduced in AML patients assigned to the favorable risk group (p < 0.05) and low levels of PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C positively affect clinical outcomes of AML patients (p < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the expression of PIP4K2 genes is associated with biological process such as signal transduction, metabolism of RNA and genomic instability related-gene sets. In summary, our study provides additional evidence of the involvement of members of the PIP4K2 family, in particular PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, in AML.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*PIP4K2A', '*PIP4K2C', '*Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 lipid kinase', '*TCGA']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to explore global DNA methylation dynamic of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from donors and their respective recipients affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) during the first year after transplant. METHODS: We measured DNA methylation profile by Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC in BM HSPC of 10 donors (t0) and their matched recipients at different time points after AHSCT, at day + 30 (t1), + 60 (t2), + 120 (t3), + 180 (t4), and + 365 (t5). Differential methylation analysis was performed by using R software and CRAN/Bioconductor packages. Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out on promoter area of significantly differentially methylated genes by clusterProfiler package and the mSigDB genes sets. RESULTS: Results show significant differences in the global methylation profile between HL and acute leukemias, and between patients with mixed and complete chimerism, with a strong methylation change, with prevailing hyper-methylation, occurring 30 days after AHSCT. Functional analysis of promoter methylation changes identified genes involved in hematopoietic cell activation, differentiation, shaping, and movement. This could be a consequence of donor cell ""adaptation"" in recipient BM niche. Interestingly, this epigenetic remodeling was reversible, since methylation returns similar to that of donor HSPCs after 1 year. Only for a pool of genes, mainly involved in dynamic shaping and trafficking, the DNA methylation changes acquired after 30 days were maintained for up to 1 year post-transplant. Finally, preliminary data suggest that the methylation profile could be used as predictor of relapse in ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data provide insights into the DNA methylation changes of HSPCs after transplantation and a new framework to investigate epigenetics of AHSCT and its outcomes.",,PMC6528331,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic bone marrow stem cell transplantation', '*CpG sites', '*DNA methylation', '*Hematological malignancies', '*Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', '*Promoter methylation region']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2332-3086'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported the luminescence syncytium induction assay (LuSIA), an assay for BLV infectivity based on CC81-BLU3G cells, which form syncytia expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) when co-cultured with BLV-infected cells. To develop a more sensitive LuSIA, we here focused on the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) within the U3 region of the BLV long terminal repeat (LTR). METHODS: We changed five nucleotide sites of the GRE in a pBLU3-EGFP reporter plasmid containing the BLV-LTR U3 region promoter by site-directed mutagenesis and we then constructed a new reporter plasmid (pBLU3GREM-EGFP) in which the EGFP reporter gene was expressed under control of the GRE-mutated LTR-U3 promoter. We also established a new CC81-derived reporter cell line harboring the GRE-mutated LTR-U3 promoter (CC81-GREMG). To evaluate the sensibility, the utility and the specificity of the LuSIA using CC81-GREMG, we co-cultured CC81-GREMG cells with BLV-persistently infected cells, free-viruses, white blood cells (WBCs) from BLV-infected cows, and bovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV)- and bovine foamy virus (BFV)-infected cells. RESULTS: We successfully constructed a new reporter plasmid harboring a mutation in the GRE and established a new reporter cell line, CC81-GREMG; this line was stably transfected with pBLU3GREM-EGFP in which the EGFP gene is expressed under control of the GRE-mutated LTR-U3 promoter and enabled direct visualization of BLV infectivity. The new LuSIA protocol using CC81-GREMG cells measures cell-to-cell infectivity and cell-free infectivity of BLV more sensitively than previous protocol using CC81-BLU3G. Furthermore, it did not respond to BIV and BFV infections, indicating that the LuSIA based on CC81-GREMG is specific for BLV infectivity. Moreover, we confirmed the utility of a new LuSIA based on CC81-GREMG cells using white blood cells (WBCs) from BLV-infected cows.

Triptolide, a diterpenoid tri-epoxide compound isolated from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii and its water-soluble pro-drug-Minnelide have shown promising anti-cancer activity. A recent clinical trial for patients with solid tumors confirmed the safety and efficacy at biologically equivalent doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day and lower. METHODS: Cell viability of multiple AML cell lines as well as patient apheresis samples were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) based assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by estimating the amount of cleaved caspase. AML cell line (THP1-Luc) was implanted in immunocompromised mice and treated with indicated doses of Minnelide. Leukemic burden before and after treatment was evaluated by imaging in an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS). RESULTS: In the current study, we show that Minnelide, at doses below maximum tolerated dose (MTD) demonstrates leukemic clearance of both primary AML blasts and luciferase expressing THP-1 cells in mice. In vitro, multiple primary AML apheresis samples and AML cell lines (THP-1, KG1, Kasumi-1, HL-60) were sensitive to triptolide mediated cell death and apoptosis in low doses. Treatment with triptolide led to a significant decrease in the colony forming ability of AML cell lines as well as in the expression of stem cell markers. Additionally, it resulted in the cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase with significant downregulation of c-Myc, a major transcriptional regulator mediating cancer cell growth and stemness. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Minnelide, with confirmed safety and activity in the clinic, exerts a potent anti-leukemic effect in multiple models of AML at doses easily achievable in patients.","['R01DK11183402/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA12472311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK11757601/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA17094605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6528210,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Minnelide', '*Triptolide', '*c-Myc']",,,,,,,,,['J Transl Med. 2019 Sep 4;17(1):301.

Nearly half of adult AML patients exhibit a cytogenetic normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). The expression level of NCALD gene was associated with the prognosis of ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression level of NCALD gene is still unclear in the prognosis of patients with AML. METHOD: We integrated 5 independent datasets totally 665 AML patients (497 CN-AML patients) to analyzed relation between NCALD gene expression and the clinical FAB classification, gene mutation, therapy, prognosis of CN-AML. We analyzed the NCALD gene expression with the prognosis and LSC of 165 AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and 78 AML patients from GEO dataset. RESULTS: High NCALD-expressing CN-AML patients were associated with poor event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to low NCALD expression (EFS, P < 0.0001, OS, P < 0.0001). In AML patients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), high NCALD expression was associated with poor survival prognosis in EFS and OS (EFS, P < 0.0051, OS, P = 0.028). Post-chemotherapy in AML patients, high NCALD expression led a worse prognosis in EFS and OS (EFS, P = 0.011; OS, P = 0.0056). In multivariate analysis, high NCALD expression was an independent prognostic factor that predicts shorter EFS and OS (EFS, P = 3.84E-05, OS, P = 8.53E-05) of CN-AML. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that high expression of NCALD gene is a poor prognostic factor for CN-AML. NCALD can be considered as independent predictors of CN-AML patients and can be used as a biomarker for the prognosis of CN-AML.",,PMC6528257,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytogenetic normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML)', '*LSC', '*NCALD', '*Prognostic factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy for de novo RS is inadequate with median survival of less than one year. Patients are frequently elderly or have co-morbidities limiting dose-intense chemotherapy. Treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) RS and RS emerging after CLL-directed therapy represent urgent unmet clinical needs. Agents targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) deliver improved outcomes for patients with high-risk CLL and expand effective treatments to frailer patients. Acalabrutinib is an oral, second-generation BTK inhibitor with a favourable toxicity profile and demonstrated activity in CLL and B-cell lymphomas. Combination of acalabrutinib with standard-of-care CHOP-R chemoimmunotherapy offers a sound rationale to test in a prospective trial for de novo RS. METHODS: The prospective multicentre STELLAR study is designed in two elements, consisting of a randomised study to evaluate the safety and activity of CHOP-R chemoimmunotherapy in combination with acalabrutinib in newly diagnosed RS and single-arm studies of novel agents for other RS patient cohorts. Eligible patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL-type RS are randomised between six cycles of CHOP-R therapy and six cycles CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib, followed by acalabrutinib maintenance. The primary endpoint of the randomised component is progression free survival (PFS). Cohort 1 enrols RS patients with progressive disease following chemoimmunotherapy for acalabrutinib monotherapy. Patients with RS diagnosed while on ibrutinib may enrol in Cohort 2, a single-arm study of CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib. The primary endpoint for the single-arm studies is overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints for all cohorts are overall survival (OS), quality of life and proportion of patients proceeding to stem cell transplantation. The study will be accompanied by exploratory analysis of the mutational landscape of RS and the relationship between dynamic changes in sequential circulating tumour DNA samples and clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: The STELLAR randomised trial evaluates the role of CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib in newly diagnosed RS patients. The single-arm platform studies enable the incorporation of promising novel therapies into the protocol. The STELLAR study has potential to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response in this high-risk malignancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT: 2017-004401-40 , registered on the 31-Oct-2017.

The study group included 28 patients with a median age of 66.8 years (range, 22.8-86.7), 22 men and 6 women. PD-L1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 10/21 (47.6%) cases. PD-L1 expression had a median H-score of 157. The H-score was >/=60 in 7 patients. PD-L1 protein levels (H-score) were proportional to normalized PD-L1 mRNA transcript levels (CD274 mRNA). In addition, high-level PD-L1 expression correlated with higher numbers of PD1-positive cells within BPDCN tumors. There was no correlation between clinicopathologic characteristics and PD-L1 expression status. Similarly, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative BPDCN (median 12 vs. 23 month, respectively; p = 0.743).

However, the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment, in particular increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, provides considerable limitations. In this study, we aimed to exploit increased ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment with prodrugs of ROS accelerators, which are specifically activated in cancer cells. Upon activation, ROS accelerators induce further generation of ROS. This leads to an accumulation of ROS in tumor cells. We hypothesized that the latter cells will be more susceptible to CARTs. CD19-specific CARTs were generated with a CD19.CAR.CD28.CD137zeta third-generation retroviral vector. Cytotoxicity was determined by chromium-51 release assay. Influence of the ROS accelerators on viability and phenotype of CARTs was determined by flow cytometry. The combination of CARTs with the ROS accelerator PipFcB significantly increased their cytotoxicity in the Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Raji and Daudi, as well as primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Exposure of CARTs to PipFcB for 48 h did not influence T cell exhaustion, viability, or T cell subpopulations. In summary, the combination of CARTs with ROS accelerators may improve adoptive immunotherapy and help to overcome tumor microenvironment-mediated treatment resistance.",,PMC6566309,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR', 'CART', 'CLL', 'ROS', 'aminoferrocene', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'reactive oxygen species']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7893-401X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2) and four classical reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2 were expressed ~100 times less than ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (p < 0.0001).

Stilbene derivatives appear as a group of therapeutics which deserves special attention. The present study was designed to analyze the effects of stilbene derivatives on drug resistant human leukemic cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the apoptotic effect of stilbene derivatives in various concentrations on leukemic cells (LC) with and without resistant phenotype. Methods: Human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines (HL60, HL60/MX1, HL60/MX2) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines (CEM/C1, CCRF-CEM) were studied. T-resveratrol, piceatannol, rhaponticin, deoxyrhaponticin, pterostilbene were used to stimulate apoptosis. Mitoxantrone (MIT) was applied to induce drug resistance. Results: t-Resveratrol (RES), deoxyrhaponticin (D-RHAP), rhaponticin (RHAP), pterostilbene (PTER), and piceatannol (PIC) influenced viability and induced apoptosis in all investigated cell lines. Conclusions: Our results confirmed that RES, PIC, RHAP, D-RHAP, and PTER are essential therapeutic compounds with anticancer activity exhibited by induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells with and without resistant phenotype. Stilbene-induced apoptosis in HL60/MX1, HL60/MX2, CEM/C1, and CCRF-CEM leukemia cell lines have been presented in very few studies so far and our research is an important contribution to the investigation of these substances.",['NN 405162 639 -ABK/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],PMC6571880,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'imaging flow cytometry', 'leukemic cell lines', 'multidrug resistance', 'stilbene derivatives']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8113-5841', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9905-7087', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8082-535X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 18.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the interaction of leukemic cells with the microenvironment ultimately affects patient outcome. CLL cases can be divided in two subgroups with different clinical course based on the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes: mutated CLL (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL). Since in CLL, the differentiated relation of genes between the two subgroups is of greater importance than the individual gene behavior, this paper investigates the differences between the groups' gene interactions, by comparing their correlation structures. Fisher's test and Zou's confidence intervals are employed to detect differences of correlation coefficients. Afterwards, networks created by the genes participating in most differences are estimated with the use of structural equation models (SEM). The analysis is enhanced with graph modeling in order to visualize the between group differences in the gene structures of the two subgroups. The applied methodology revealed stronger correlations between genes in U-CLL patients, a finding in line with related biomedical literature. Using SEM for multigroup analysis, different gene structures between the two groups of patients were confirmed. The study of correlation structures can facilitate the detection of differential gene expression profiles in CLL subgroups, with potential applications in other diseases. Comparison of correlations can be very useful in understanding the complex internal structural differences which signify the variations of a disease.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*Comparing correlations', '*Gene expression profiles', '*Structural equation models']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 18.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The burden of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection among patients with haematological malignancy has only been scarcely reported. Therefore, we aimed to describe this burden in patients with haematological malignancies, including those receiving allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicentre cohort study across 11 European centres and collected clinical characteristics of 50 patients with haematological malignancy and RNA-positive, clinically overt hepatitis E between April 2014 and March 2017. The primary endpoint was HEV-associated mortality; the secondary endpoint was HEV-associated liver-related morbidity. RESULTS: The most frequent underlying haematological malignancies were aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (34%), indolent NHL (iNHL) (24%), and acute leukaemia (36%). Twenty-one (42%) patients had received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Death with ongoing hepatitis E occurred in 8 (16%) patients, including 1 patient with iNHL and 1 patient >100days after alloHSCT in complete remission, and was associated with male sex (p=0.040), cirrhosis (p=0.006) and alloHSCT (p=0.056). Blood-borne transmission of hepatitis E was demonstrated in 5 (10%) patients, and associated with liver-related mortality in 2 patients. Hepatitis E progressed to chronic hepatitis in 17 (34%) patients overall, and in 10 (47.6%) and 6 (50%) alloHSCT and iNHL patients, respectively. Hepatitis E was associated with acute or acute-on-chronic liver failure in 4 (8%) patients with 75% mortality. Ribavirin was administered to 24 (48%) patients, with an HEV clearance rate of 79.2%. Ribavirin treatment was associated with lower mortality (p=0.037) and by trend with lower rates of chronicity (p=0.407) when initiated <24 and <12weeks after diagnosis of hepatitis E, respectively. Immunosuppressive treatment reductions were associated with mortality in 2 patients (28.6%). CONCLUSION: Hepatitis E is associated with mortality and liver-related morbidity in patients with haematological malignancy. Blood-borne transmission contributes to the burden. Ribavirin should be initiated early, whereas reduction of immunosuppressive treatment requires caution. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about the burden of hepatitis E among patients with haematological malignancy. We conducted a retrospective European cohort study among 50 patients with haematological malignancy, including haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, with clinically significant HEV infection and found that hepatitis E is associated with hepatic and extrahepatic mortality, including among patients with indolent disease or among stem cell transplant recipients in complete remission. Hepatitis E virus infection evolved to chronic hepatitis in 5 (45.5%) patients exposed to a rituximab-containing regimen and 10 (47.6%) stem cell transplant recipients. Reducing immunosuppressive therapy because of hepatitis E was associated with mortality, while early ribavirin treatment was safe and effective.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood transfusion', '*Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Hepatitis E virus', '*Immunocompromised host', '*Outcome', '*Ribavirin']",,['Crown Copyright (c) 2019.

METHOD: Data from 53 ET patients who received anagrelide as a first-line therapy were reviewed for patient characteristics, antiplatelet status, cytoreduction status, therapeutic effects, adverse events, thrombohemorrhagic event development, progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia, and cause of death. RESULTS: The rate of achieving a platelet count of <600 x 10(9) /L during anagrelide monotherapy was 83.0%. Adverse events occurred in 32 of 53 patients, and tended to be slightly more severe in patients with cardiac failure; however, they were mostly tolerable. The therapeutic effect of anagrelide was consistent, regardless of genetic mutation profiles. The incidence of anemia as an adverse event was significantly higher in the CALR mutation-positive group. Favorable platelet counts were also achieved in patients for whom hydroxyurea was introduced as a replacement for anagrelide or in addition to anagrelide because of unresponsiveness or intolerance to treatment. CONCLUSION: In Japanese cytoreduction therapy-naive ET patients, anagrelide administration as a first-line therapy demonstrated favorable effects in reducing platelet counts, and its safety profile that was generally consistent with those in previous reports.",,PMC6851998,,['NOTNLM'],"['anagrelide', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'first-line', 'treatment']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5419-9156', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3374-9814', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8365-3987']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Identification of symptom clusters and their influencing factors in children with acute leukemia may improve the management of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate symptom clusters in children with acute leukemia during chemotherapy and analyze the factors influencing their severity. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 159 Chinese children with acute leukemia during chemotherapy. A demographic questionnaire and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale 10-18 were completed by the patients and their parents. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify symptom clusters. Univariate analyses and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the factors affecting symptom clusters. RESULTS: Six clusters were identified, including gastrointestinal cluster, emotional cluster, head-related cluster, self-image disorder cluster, skin itching/irritation cluster, and somatic cluster. Factors influencing the severity of symptom clusters included age, gender, stage of chemotherapy, and medical reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple symptom clusters in children with acute leukemia during chemotherapy. Medical care staff should manage symptoms from the perspective of symptom cluster and carry out personalized interventions according to factors influencing these clusters. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The ability to predict symptom clusters in children with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy may assist with optimal clinical decision making in order to alleviate the symptom burden and improve children's quality of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.,"Severe uterine injuries may lead to infertility or pregnancy complications. There is a lack of effective methods to restore the structure and function of seriously injured uteri. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which plays a crucial role in blastocyst implantation, promotes the process of regeneration after injury in several different tissues. In this study, we explored the effect of LIF on the regeneration of rat uterine horns following full-thickness injury. One hundred and twenty four female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three groups, including a sham-operated group (n = 34 uterine horns), a PBS/collagen group (n = 90 uterine horns), and a LIF/collagen group (n = 124 uterine horns). The regenerated uterine horns were collected at 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks after the surgery. The results showed that LIF/collagen scaffolds increased the number of endometrial cells and neovascularization 2 weeks after uterine full-thickness defect in excision sites (p < 0.001 vs PBS/collagen). Eight weeks after the surgery, the number of endometrial glands was dramatically higher in the LIF/collagen scaffolds group (35.2 +/- 4.1/field) than in the PBS/collagen scaffolds (15.1 +/- 1.4/field). The percentage of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)-positive areas in the LIF/collagen scaffolds (88.8% +/- 9.8%) was also significantly higher than that in the PBS/collagen group (52.9% +/- 3.7%). Moreover, LIF improved the pregnancy rate and fetus number. We also found that LIF inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells and down-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 expression while up-regulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression in the injured part of the uterine horns. Our results indicate that LIF promotes regeneration of the uterus after injury, and this is at least partially due to its immunomodulatory properties. In addition, it is worth to explore further the possibility for LIF/collagen to be an alternative therapeutic approach for uterine damage in the clinic in near future.",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5475-7840'],['(c) 2019 by the Wound Healing Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, a mother's exposures before and during pregnancy could have important consequences for her child's health, including cancer development. We examined whether birth certificate-derived maternal anthropometric characteristics were associated with increased risk of subsequent childhood cancer development, accounting for established maternal and infant risk factors. Pennsylvania birth and cancer registry files were linked by the state Department of Health, yielding a virtual cohort of births and childhood cancers from 2003 through 2016. The analysis included 1,827,875 infants (13,785,309 person-years at risk), with 2,352 children diagnosed with any cancer and 747 with leukemia before age 14 years. Children born to mothers with a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) of >/=40 had a 57% (95% confidence interval: 12, 120) higher leukemia risk. Newborn size of >/=30% higher than expected was associated with 2.2-fold and 1.8-fold hazard ratios for total childhood cancer and leukemia, respectively, relative to those with expected size. Being <30% below expected size also increased the overall cancer risk (P for curvilinearity < 0.0001). Newborn size did not mediate the association between maternal obesity and childhood cancer. The results suggest a significant role of early-life exposure to maternal obesity- and fetal growth-related factors in childhood cancer development.",['T32 CA186873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6670047,,['NOTNLM'],"['*birth weight', '*cohort studies', '*leukemia', '*maternal exposure', '*obesity']",,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Graft-versus-host (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As donor T cells are recognized as key drivers of GVHD, some approaches to prevent GVHD have focused on T cell depletion of the allograft. In this review we summarize methods and outcomes of ex vivo T cell depleted (TCD) HCT with a focus on CD34+ selection. This platform is efficacious in preventing acute and chronic GVHD across a wide range of hematologic malignancies, and with the exception of chronic myeloid leukemia, is not associated with adverse relapse or survival outcomes compared to conventional GVHD prophylaxis platforms. In retrospective comparisons recipients of CD34+ selected HCT have higher rates of GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) than conventional HCT counterparts. Although CD34+ selected allografts require myeloablative and antithymocyte-globulin based conditioning to support engraftment, abrogation of calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate in this approach reduces its toxicity such that it can be considered in select older and more comorbid patients who could benefit from ablative HCT. A trial comparing GVHD prophylaxis regimens (BMT CTN 1301, NCT02345850) has completed accrual and will be the first to compare CD34+ selected HCT with conventional HCT in a randomized prospective setting. Its findings have potential to establish CD34+ selected HCT as a new standard-of-care platform for GVHD prevention.","['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6521977,['NIHMS995105'],['NOTNLM'],"['*CD34+selection', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*T cell depletion', '*graft-versus-host disease']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6619-4547'],,"['Conflicts of interest Dr Perales reports personal fees from Abbvie, Merck,', 'Incyte, Novartis, Takeda, and Nektar Therapeutics.

There is a large body of evidence on inequalities in adult cancer, observable throughout the societies on a national level as well as on a global scale. Socioeconomic influences on health matter at all ages including childhood, for which childhood cancer is the leading cause of disease related death in high-income countries (HICs). Substantial differences in the reported incidence of childhood cancers have been observed globally by socioeconomic development of a population. This is reflected in the higher incidence rates reported for HICs, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and for cancer in infants (below 1 year), compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Considerable inequalities between populations and degree of socioeconomic development are also noted for survival from childhood cancer, with substantially lower survival rates seen in most LMICs compared to HICs. With respect to inequalities by socioeconomic position (SEP) within countries, findings of an association between SEP and childhood cancer risk are diverse and limited to studies from HICs. On the contrary, observations on social inequalities in survival within countries are accumulating and indicate that survival inequalities do not only concern resource-poor countries but also high-income populations including European countries. In turn, a childhood cancer diagnosis in itself may have implications on the parents' socioeconomic situation as well as on the later socioeconomic life after having survived the disease. The underlying mechanisms and causal pathways of these empirically demonstrated social inequalities are poorly understood, although it is of significant public health relevance for any actions or strategies to reduce childhood cancer-related inequity. We propose a conceptual framework on potential underlying mechanism and pathways specifically addressing social inequalities in childhood cancer and after childhood cancer to (i) illustrate potential pathways by which social determinants may create health inequities at different points of the childhood cancer continuum; (ii) illustrate potential pathways by which a childhood cancer diagnosis may impact the socioeconomic situation of the concerned family or the later life of a childhood survivor; and (iii) point out how major determinants may relate to each other.",,PMC6492628,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'conceptual framework', 'incidence', 'pathways and underlying mechanisms', 'social determinants', 'social inequalities', 'survival', 'survivors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to investigate the therapeutic effect of As4S4 in highly metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) animal model, as As4S4 has not been applied in the treatment of breast cancer yet. To overcome the poor solubility of original As4S4, a formulation of hydrophilic As4S4 nanoparticles (e-As4S4) developed previously was applied to mouse breast cancer cells as well as the tumor-bearing mice. It was shown that e-As4S4 was much more cytotoxic than r-As4S4, strongly inhibiting the proliferation of the cells and scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The oral administration of e-As4S4 significantly increased the accumulation of arsenic in the tumor tissue and eliminated ROS in tumor tissues. Besides, e-As4S4 could also inhibit the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Consequently, the angiogenesis was reduced, the metastasis to lung and liver was inhibited and the survival of tumor-bearing mice was prolonged.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) plays an important role in leukemia pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance. The mechanisms of ferroptosis in tumor pathogenesis and treatment have been a recent research focus but the role of HMGB1 in regulating ferroptosis especially in leukemia still remains largely unknown. Here, we shown that HMGB1 is a critical regulator of eratin-induced ferroptosis in HL-60 cell line expressing NRAS(Q61L) (HL-60/NRAS(Q61L)). Erastin enhanced ROS levels, thereby promoting cytosolic translocation of HMGB1 and enhancing cell death. Knockdown of HMGB1 decreased erastin-induced ROS generation and cell death in an iron-mediated lysosomal pathway in HL-60/NRAS(Q61L) cells. Knockdown of HMGB1 or rat sarcoma (RAS), or pharmacological inhibition of JNK and p38 decreased TfR1 levels in HL-60/NRAS(Q61L) cells. Importantly, these data were further supported by our in vivo experiment, in which xenografts formed by HMGB1 knockdown HL-60/NRAS(Q61L) cells had lower PTGS2 and TfR1 expression than that in control mice. Taken together, these results suggest that HMGB1 is a novel regulator of ferroptosis via the RAS-JNK/p38 pathway and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia.",,PMC6511643,,['NOTNLM'],"['HMGB1', 'MAPK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'ferroptosis', 'transferrin receptor 1']",,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Jan 23.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that tissue factor (TF) is selectively expressed in pathological angiogenesis-dependent as well as macrophage-associated human diseases. Pathological angiogenesis, the formation of neovasculature, is involved in many clinically significant human diseases, notably cancer, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), endometriosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Macrophage is involved in the progression of a variety of human diseases, such as atherosclerosis and viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV and Ebola). It is well documented that TF is selectively expressed on angiogenic vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in these pathological angiogenesis-dependent human diseases and on disease-associated macrophages. Under physiology condition, TF is not expressed by quiescent VECs and monocytes but is solely restricted on some cells (such as pericytes) that are located outside of blood circulation and the inner layer of blood vessel walls. Here, we summarize TF expression on angiogenic VECs, macrophages and other diseased cell types in these human diseases. In cancer, for example, the cancer cells also overexpress TF in solid cancers and leukemia. Moreover, our group recently reported that TF is also expressed by cancer-initiating stem cells (CSCs) and can serve as a novel oncotarget for eradication of CSCs without drug resistance. Furthermore, we review and discuss two generations of TF-targeting therapeutic antibody-like immunoconjugates (ICON and L-ICON1) and antibody-drug conjugates that are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of some of these human diseases. If efficacy and safety are proven in current and future clinical trials, TF-targeting immunoconjugates may provide novel therapeutic approaches with potential to broadly impact the treatment regimen of these significant angiogenesis-dependent, as well as macrophage-associated, human diseases.","['R21 CA216697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001070/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6519474,['NIHMS1027778'],['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*Leukemia', '*age-related macular degeneration', '*angiogenesis', '*antibodies', '*antibody-like immunoconjugates (ICON and L-ICON1)', '*atherosclerosis', '*cancer cell', '*cancer stem cell', '*endometriosis', '*factor VII', '*fibroblast', '*macrophage', '*rheumatoid arthritis', '*solid cancer', '*tissue factor', '*vascular endothelial cell']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0023-1170'],,"['Conflicts of Interest: Z.H. is co-inventor of the first-generation tissue', 'factor-targeting ""neovascular-targeted immunoconjugates"" (ICON) and is the', 'inventor of the second- and third-generation tissue factor-targeting ICONs (U.S.', 'patents pending).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of the BCR-ABL fusion protein over 50 years ago has brought about a new era of therapeutic progress and overall improvement in patient care, mainly due to the development and use of personalized medicine and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, since the detection of BCR-ABL, BCR has been identified as a commonly occurring fusion partner in hematopoietic disorders. BCR has been discovered fused to additional tyrosine kinases, including: Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1), Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRA), Ret Proto-Oncogene (RET), and Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). While BCR translocations are infrequent in hematopoietic malignancies, clinical evidence suggests that patients who harbor these mutations benefit from TKIs and additional personalized therapies. The improvement of further methodologies for characterization of these fusions is crucial to determine a patient's treatment regimen, and optimal outcome. However, potential relapse and drug resistance among patients' highlights the need for additional treatment options and further understanding of these oncogenic fusion proteins. This review explores the mechanisms behind cancer progression of these BCR oncogenic fusion proteins, comparing their similarities and differences, examining the significance of BCR as a partner gene, and discussing current treatment options for these translocation-induced hematopoietic malignancies.",,PMC6505627,,['NOTNLM'],"['RTK', 'breakpoint cluster region', 'chromosomal translocation', 'leukemia', 'oncogenic fusion protein']",,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST There are no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impaired DNA methylation plays a central role in the onset and progression of several types of malignancies, and DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) consisting of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMTs are frequently implicated in the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. In this review, we describe and discuss the oncogenic roles of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B in AML. The clinical response predictive roles of DNMTs in clinical trials utilising hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) in AML patients are presented. Novel hypomethylating agent (guadecitabine) and experimental DNMT inhibitors in AML are also discussed. In summary, hypermethylation of tumour suppressors mediated by DNMT1 or DNMT3B contributes to the progression and severity of AML (except MLL-AF9 and inv(16)(p13;q22) AML for DNMT3B), while mutation affecting DNMT3A represents an early genetic lesion in the pathogenesis of AML. In clinical trials of AML patients, expression of DNMTs is downregulated by hypomethylating agents while the clinical response predictive roles of DNMT biomarkers remain unresolved. Finally, nucleoside hypomethylating agents have continued to show enhanced responses in clinical trials of AML patients, and novel non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors have demonstrated cytotoxicity against AML cells in pre-clinical settings.",,PMC6509988,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT1', 'DNMT3A', 'DNMT3B', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'azacitidine', 'decitabine', 'guadecitabine']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7359-6202'],,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"BACKGROUND: Galectin 3 (LGALS3) gene expression is associated with poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but the prognostic impact of LGALS3 protein expression in AML is unknown. LGALS3 supports diverse survival pathways including RAS mediated cascades, protein expression and stability of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, and activation of proliferative pathways including those mediated by beta Catenin. CD74 is a positive regulator of CD44 and CXCR4 signaling and this molecule may be critical for AML stem cell function. At present, the role of LGALS3 and CD74 in AML is unclear. In this study, we examine protein expression of LGALS3 and CD74 by reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) and identify new protein networks associated with these molecules. In addition, we determine prognostic potential of LGALS3, CD74, and their protein networks for clinical correlates in AML patients. METHODS: RPPA was used to determine relative expression of LGALS3, CD74, and 229 other proteins in 231 fresh AML patient samples and 205 samples were from patients who were treated and evaluable for outcome. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify proteins associated with LGALS3 and CD74. Progeny clustering was performed to generate protein networks. String analysis was performed to determine protein:protein interactions in networks and to perform gene ontology analysis. Kaplan-Meir method was used to generate survival curves. FINDINGS: LGALS3 is highest in monocytic AML patients and those with elevated LGALS3 had significantly shorter remission duration compared to patients with lower LGALS3 levels (median 21.9 vs 51.3weeks, p=0.016). Pearson correlation of LGALS3 with 230 other proteins identifies a distinct set of 37 proteins positively correlated with LGALS3 expression levels with a high representation of proteins involved in AKT and ERK signaling pathways. Thirty-one proteins were negatively correlated with LGALS3 including an AKT phosphatase. Pearson correlation of proteins associated with CD74 identified 12 proteins negatively correlated with CD74 and 16 proteins that are positively correlated with CD74. CD74 network revealed strong association with CD44 signaling and a high representation of apoptosis regulators. Progeny clustering was used to build protein networks based on LGALS3 and CD74 associated proteins. A strong relationship of the LGALS3 network with the CD74 network was identified. For AML patients with both the LGALS3 and CD74 protein cluster active, median overall survival was only 24.3weeks, median remission duration was 17.8weeks, and no patient survived beyond one year. INTERPRETATION: The findings from this study identify for the first time protein networks associated with LGALS3 and CD74 in AML. Each network features unique pathway characteristics. The data also suggest that the LGALS3 network and the CD74 network each support AML cell survival and the two networks may cooperate in a novel high risk AML population. FUND: Leukemia Lymphoma Society provided funds to SMK for RPPA study of AML patient population. Texas Leukemia provided funds to PPR and SMK to study CD74 and LGALS3 expression in AML patients using RPPA.

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Our previous study revealed altered resting-stated brain function in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on new-onset stage. To investigate the effects after induction chemotherapy, a pilot self-contrast study was conducted to compare the difference in resting-stated brain function between pre- and post-induction chemotherapy of ALL. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was employed for fMRI data analysis. Clinical and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data of 14 new-onset pediatric ALL patients were collected before and after 3months of induction chemotherapy. Fourteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for comparison. Before induction chemotherapy, fALFF values of ALL patients decreased globally, especially in the default mode network (DMN), left frontal lobe, left occipital lobe, and bilateral postcentral gyri as compared to HCs. After induction chemotherapy, fALFF values of ALL patients decreased significantly in the bilateral cuneus, left lingual and calcarine gyri, and left mid frontal gyrus. Paired-sample t-tests and self-contrast analysis showed fALFF increased in the left precuneus, bilateral cuneus, left occipital lobe, bilateral frontal gyri, and bilateral temporal lobes, whereas fALFF in the bilateral precuneus decreased in the ALL patients after induction, which suggests potential side-effects of the treatment. The alteration of fALFF values suggested that resting brain function was impaired before induction chemotherapy and mostly recovered after treatment. This study suggested that fALFF is a reliable and feasible tool in detecting spontaneous brain activity to monitor early neurocognitive impairments in pediatric ALL to better understand the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of chemotherapy on the brain.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Brain', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Pediatric']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of B7H3 and B7H4 protein in 100 cases of T-LBL/ALL(test group) and 30 cases of lymph node reactive hyperplasia (LH) (control group), diagnosed at Shanxi Cancer Hospital from January 2001 to June 2017. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of B7H3 and B7H4 in 50 cases of T-LBL/ALL and 30 cases of LH (control group). Results: There were 79 males,21 females. Immunohistochemical results showed that the expression rates of B7H3 and B7H4 were 23%(23/100) and 54%(54/100), respectively. By real-time RT-PCR, the relative expression of B7H3 mRNA in the T-LBL/ALL group was 2.5 times of that of the LH group. The expression levels of B7H4 mRNA in T-LBL/ALL group and LH group were extremely low.Single factor analysis showed that B7H3 protein expression in T-LBL/ALL group was associated with B symptoms and primary nodal disease (P<0.05). B7H4 protein expression was associated with mediastinal broadening and bone marrow involvement (P<0.05). B7H3 protein, B7H3 mRNA, B7H4 protein expression and IPI score were associated with prognosis (P<0.05), and the combined expression of B7H3 and B7H4 was associated with T-LBL/ALL prognosis (P<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that overexpression of B7H3 mRNA was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients with T-LBL/ALL (P<0.05). Conclusion: Expression of B7H3 and B7H4 is closely corelated with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients with T-LBL/ALL, suggesting that B7H3 and B7H4 expression play an important role in the development of T-LBL/ALL.",['201601D011129/Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Pathology, clinical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL-60 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were selected and divided into control, hypoxia, ultraviolet and hypoxia+ultraviolet groups. The cells in the hypoxia group were treated with cobalt chloride (with a final concentration of 150 mumol/L), those in the ultraviolet group were irradiated by 280 nm-LED ultraviolet with an energy intensity of 30 J/m(2), and those in the hypoxia+ultraviolet group were treated with cobalt chloride and then irradiated by 280 nm-LED ultraviolet. After 48 hours of treatment, the cells were placed under an invert microscope to observe cell morphology. CCK-8 assay was used to measure the inhibition rate of cell proliferation. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry was used to evaluate cell apoptosis. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of Bcl-2. Each experiment above was repeated three times independently. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the experimental groups showed shrinkage, decreased brightness, and disordered arrangement of cells, and the number of cells decreased over the time of culture. There were significant differences in the inhibition rate of cell proliferation and cell apoptosis rate among the groups (P<0.01), and the hypoxia+ultraviolet group showed the strongest inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis, followed by the ultraviolet group and the hypoxia group. Compared with the control group, the other three groups had a gradual reduction in the mRNA expression of Bcl-2, and the hypoxia+ultraviolet group had a significantly greater reduction than the hypoxia and ultraviolet groups (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both hypoxia and ultraviolet irradiation can inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells and induce cell apoptosis, and ultraviolet irradiation has a better effect on proliferation inhibition and cell apoptosis under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions, possibly by downregulating the mRNA expression of Bcl-2.",,PMC7389421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 150 ALL children and adolescents aged >10 years who were treated with CCLG-ALL2008 regimen from April 2008 to April 2015. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate. RESULTS: Among the 150 children and adolescents, there were 87 (58.0%) boys and 63 (42.0%) girls, with a median age of 11 years (range 10-15 years). Of the 150 children and adolescents, 84 (56.0%) had intermediate risk and 66 (44.0%) had high risk; 122 (81.3%) had B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 28 (18.7%) had T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The fusion gene test yielded positive results in 51 children and adolescents (34.0%), among whom 16 (31%) had positive BCR-ABL, 11 (22%) had positive TEL-AML1, 8 (16%) had positive E2A-PBX1, and 16 (31%) were positive for other fusion genes. The complete remission rate was 96.0% (144/150) after one course of treatment with CCLG-ALL2008 regimen. The median follow-up time was 52 months (range 3-122 months). The 5-year OS rate was 79.0%+/-3.5%, and the 5-year EFS rate was 67.3%+/-4.1%.

Methods: The retrospective analyses of flow cytometric (FCM) immunophenotypic anyalysis, chromosome karyotype and chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 798 outpatient or hospitalization APL patients referred to our hospital between May 2012 and December 2017 were performed to further study the application values of FCM and molecular genetics in the diagnosis of APL. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of FCM were 91.9% and 98.7% respectively. The typical characteristic immunophenotype for APL was as of follows: a high SSC, absence of expression of cluster differntiation (CD) CD34 and HLA-DR, and expression or stronger expression of CD33, consistent expression of CD13, CD9, CD123, expression of CD56, CD7, CD2 (sometimes) . The rest 10% of the cases harbored atypical APL phenotypes, generally accompanied by CD34 and/or HLA-DR expression, decreased SSC and often accompanied by CD2 expression, it was difficult to definitively diagnose APL by this FCM phenotype, and their diagnoses depended on the results of genetics or molecular biology tests. Compared with normal individuals, complex karyotypes APL with t (15;17) translocation, other variant translocations and variant t (11;17) , t (5;17) had no significant differences in terms of their FCM phenotypes. Conclusions: FCM could rapidly and effectively diagnose APL. Despite the fact that complex karyotypes with various additional chromosomal abnormalities were detected in approximately one third of APL cases in addition to the pathognomonic t (15;17) (q22;q21) , they had no observable impact on the overall immunophenotype. Molecular and genetic criteria were the golden criteria for the diagnosis of APL.

Methods: Forty-eight children, 29 boys and 19 girls, aged 3-17years old (median age was 8 years old) , with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive B-ALL, were treated by the CD19 specific CAR-T cells. A total of 48 cases received 61 infusions. Flow cytometry or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method were used to monitor micro residual disease (MRD) . The follow-up period was from 16 to 1 259 days with the median follow-up of 406 days. SPSS software was used to statistical analysis. Results: No adverse reaction was observed during 61 infusions. The most common adverse reaction after CAR-T cell infusions was cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) . Only 2 cases experienced level 3 CRS performance, including continuous high fever, convulsions, delirium, serous cavity effusion, and decreasing of blood pressure. Tocilizumab was given to release CRS performance. No treatment-related death occurred. Thirty-seven patients showed response during 7 to 28 days after infusions. The early response rate was 77.1%, with MRD before infusion less than 5% group higher than the MRD more than 5% group (87.1% vs 58.8%, chi(2)=4.968, P=0.036) . For the 37 patients who showed response to CAR-T cell infusions, univariate analysis identified that age, disease status at the time of treatment, MRD before infusion affected 2-year OS rate (P<0.05) . Multivariate prognostic analysis for EFS disclosed that the MRD before infusion more than 5% (RR=3.433, 95% CI 1.333-8.844, P=0.011) and not bridge to HSCT (RR=4.996, 95% CI 1.852-13.474, P=0.001) were the independent risk factors. Conclusion: The fourth generation CAR-T cells directed against CD19 could effectively and safely treat relapsed and refractory B-ALL, which implicated that CAR-T therapy as a novel therapeutic approach could be useful for patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL who have failed all other treatment options.

Epub 2019 May 20.,"Background: Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignancy resulting from the accumulation of genetic abnormalities in the cells. Human baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), encodes survivin, is one of only a handful of genes that is differentially over-expressed in numerous malignant diseases including AML. Methods: The BIRC5 was silenced permanently in two AML cell lines, HL60 and KG-1, via the CRISPR/Cas9n system. After transfection of CRISPR constructs, genomic DNA was extracted and amplified to assess mutation detection. To evaluate BIRC5 gene expression, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. Also, MTT cell viability and AnnexinV/propidium iodide flowcytometric staining were performed, and the data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Levene's, and ANOVA tests. Results: The results indicated that Cas9n and its sgRNAs successfully triggered site-specific cleavage and mutation in the BIRC5 gene locus. Moreover, suppression of BIRC5 resulted in the reduction of cell viability, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis in HL60 and KG1 suggested that the permanent suppression of BIRC5 remarkably dropped the gene expression and cells viability. Conclusion: This study reinforces the idea that BIRC5 disruption via Cas9n:sgRNAs has favorable effects on the AML clinical outcome. It thereby can be a promising candidate in a variety of leukemia treatments.",,PMC6800533,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelocytic leukemia', '*CRISPR', '*Gene editing', '*Survivin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 18.,"L-asparaginase is an enzyme produced by microorganisms, plants, and animals, which is used clinically for the treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and, in the food industry, to control acrylamide formation in baked foods. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available literature regarding microbial sources of L-asparaginase, culture media used to achieve maximum enzyme expression in microbial fermentations, and assay methods employed to assess L-asparaginase activity. Studies were gathered by searching PubMed, and Web of Science databases before January 22, 2018, with no time restrictions. The articles were evaluated according to the source of L-asparaginase being studied, the nitrogen source in the culture medium, the type of sample, and the method employed to evaluate L-asparaginase activity. Bacterial L-asparaginase appeared to be the most commonly studied source of the enzyme and, most often, the enzyme activity was assayed from crude protein extracts using the Nessler method, which is an indirect measurement of asparaginase activity that determines the concentration of ammonia generated after the action of the enzyme on the substrate, L-asparagine. However, ammonia is also generated throughout microbial fermentations and this endogenous ammonia will also reduce the Nessler reagent if crude microbial extracts are used to determine total L-asparaginase activity. We suggest that current estimates of L-asparaginase activity reported in the literature may be overestimated when Nessler reagent is used, since we were unable to find a single study that made reference to the possible inference of fermentation derived ammonia.",['193.000.972/2015/Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Enzyme assay', 'Interferences', 'L-Asparaginase', 'Nessler method']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8011-6940'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 18.,"Efficient and safe delivery of siRNA in vivo is the biggest roadblock to clinical translation of RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics. To date, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown efficient delivery of siRNA to the liver; however, delivery to other organs, especially hematopoietic tissues still remains a challenge. We developed DLin-MC3-DMA lipid-based LNP-siRNA formulations for systemic delivery against a driver oncogene to target human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in vivo. A microfluidic mixing technology was used to obtain reproducible ionizable cationic LNPs loaded with siRNA molecules targeting the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene found in CML. We show a highly efficient and non-toxic delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo with nearly 100% uptake of LNP-siRNA formulations in bone marrow of a leukemic model. By targeting the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, we show a reduction of leukemic burden in our myeloid leukemia mouse model and demonstrate reduced disease burden in mice treated with LNP-BCR-ABL siRNA as compared with LNP-CTRL siRNA. Our study provides proof-of-principle that fusion oncogene specific RNAi therapeutics can be exploited against leukemic cells and promise novel treatment options for leukemia patients.","['111267/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '5240/5-2/Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum', '638035/Horizon 2020', '638035/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'HE 5240/6-2/Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum']",PMC7116733,['EMS115627'],['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Lipid nanoparticle', 'RNAi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 8.,"Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of tumor cells that proliferate, self-renew and produce more differentiated tumoral cells building-up the tumor. Responsible for the sustained growth of malignant tumors, cancer stem cells are proposed to play significant roles in cancer resistance to standard treatment and in tumor recurrence. Among the mechanisms dysregulated in neoplasms, those related to Ca(2+) play significant roles in various aspects of cancers. Ca(2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger whose fluctuations of its intracellular concentrations are tightly controlled by channels, pumps, exchangers and Ca(2+) binding proteins. These components support the genesis of Ca(2+) signals with specific spatio-temporal characteristics that define the cell response. Being involved in the coupling of extracellular events with intracellular responses, the Ca(2+) toolkit is often hijacked by cancer cells to promote notably their proliferation and invasion. Growing evidence obtained during the last decade pointed to a role of Ca(2+) handling and mishandling in cancer stem cells. In this review, after a general overview of the concept of cancer stem cells we analyse and discuss the studies and current knowledge regarding the complex roles of Ca(2+) toolkit and signaling in these cells. We highlight that numbers of Ca(2+) signaling actors promote cancer stem cell state and are associated with cell resistance to current cancer treatments and thus may represent promising targets for potential clinical applications.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ca(2+)channel', '*Cancer stem cell', '*Chemotherapy resistance', '*Endoplasmic reticulum', '*Glioma', '*Intracellular Ca(2+)signaling', '*Leukemia', '*Melanoma', '*Metastasis', '*Proliferation', '*Stem cell', '*Store-operated channel', '*Transient receptor potential channel', '*Tumor relapse', '*Voltage-gated channel']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on pediatric leukemia incidence provides valuable information for cancer control and interventions in Canada. METHODS: Using a linked data from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR), Canadian Census of Population (CCP) and National Household Survey (NHS) we aimed to quantify socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of pediatric leukemia from 1992 to 2010. We used the concentration index (C) approach to quantify income- and education-related inequalities in the incidence of pediatric leukemia over time. RESULTS: Though there were fluctuations in incidence over the study period, our results showed that the total incidence of pediatric leukemia in Canada was generally consistent from 1992 to 2010. Incidence rate of 47 per 1,000,000 as at 1992 rose to 57 per 1,000,000 in 2010. The estimated values of the C over the study period failed to show any significant association between pediatric leukemia incidence and household income or education status. CONCLUSIONS: Although pediatric leukemia incidence is not rising significantly, it is not reducing significantly either. The incidence of pediatric leukemia showed no significant association with socioeconomic status. Future cancer control interventions should focus more on mitigating risk factors that are independent of socioeconomic status.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Canada', '*Concentration index', '*Inequalities', '*Pediatric leukemia', '*Socioeconomic status']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 12.,"FLT3 mutation is among the most common genetic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is also related with poor overall survival and refractory in AML patients. Recently, FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for AML therapy. Herein, a series of new compounds with pyrazole amine scaffold was discovered, which showed potent inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD and significant selectivity against both FLT3-ITD and AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Compound 46, possessing the most promising cellular activity, blocked the autophosphorylation of FLT3 pathway in MV4-11cell line. Furthermore, the apoptosis and downregulation of P-STAT5 were also observed in tumor cells extracted from the MV4-11cell xenografts model upon compound 46 treatment.

Epub 2019 Apr 26.,"INTRODUCTION: Hematologists deal every day with high mortality rates of acute leukemia patients. Many times these patients need Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support and some general ICU teams believe that these patients have a much greater chance of dying than patients with other pathologies. In Brazil, data related to mortality rates and ICUs for acute leukemia patients are scarce. METHODS: Therefore, to assess mortality predictors in patients with acute leukemia admitted to a specialized hematological ICU, we evaluated demographics, supportive care, hospitalization time, disease status, admitting diagnosis, neutropenia, number of transfusions and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)/Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores as possible factors associated with mortality. Data were extracted from the first admission records of 110 patients with acute leukemia admitted to the Hemocentro de Pernambuco (Hemope) ICU between 2006 and 2009. RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study, 72/110 of the patients were men, and 64/110 were from the metropolitan area of Recife. The patients' age median was 43.5 years (+/-17.9); 67.3% had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 32.7% had acute lymphoid leukemia. The main admitting diagnosis in the ICU was sepsis (66.7%). The mean APACHE II score was 18.3. Of the total, 65 (59%) died, and the mortality rate was independently related to longer hospitalization (p<0.001), the increase in the APACHE II score (p<0.038) and having received hemodialysis (p<0.006). Neutropenia, receiving multiple transfusions and using any kind of mechanical ventilation or vasoactive drug on admission were not relevant to mortality. Factors associated with higher mortality rates were: longer hospitalization, increase in the APACHE II score, and use of hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: With these data, to prevent organ lesions before admission to the ICU, a better strategy might be to reduce mortality for leukemia patients.",,PMC7031107,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Blood malignancies', 'Intensive care', 'Mortality', 'Sepsis']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were included. From 1997 to 2003, the first group received modified Total Therapy XIIIB (previous protocol). From 2004 to 2014, the latter had modified Total Therapy XV (current protocol). RESULTS: In 250 patients, the event-free survival rates (+/- standard error) of the previous protocol (n = 95) were 82.8 +/- 3.9%, 81.7 +/- 4.0%, and 81.7 +/- 4.0% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively; current protocol event-free survival rates (n = 155) were 84 +/- 3.0%, 80.8 +/- 3.4%, and 80.8 +/- 3.4%, respectively. Previous protocol overall survival rates for the same years were 89.2 +/- 3.2%, 84.8 +/- 3.8%, and 84.8 +/- 3.8%, and for the current protocol were 90 +/- 2.5%, 86.9 +/- 3.2%, and 83.7 +/- 4.4%. Previous protocol relapses were 10.5% (10 patients), with 7 having isolated hematologic and 3 isolated/combined central nervous system relapses. Current protocol relapses were 9.7% (15 patients), with 7 having isolated hematologic, 6 isolated/combined central nervous system, and 2 extramedullary relapses. Patients with leukocyte counts over 100 x 10(9)/L and who had disease classified as high risk had worse event-free survival using the previous protocol. However, only initial leukocyte counts of >/= 100 x 10(9)/L predicted adverse outcomes under the current protocol. Minimal residual disease positivity was a prognostic factor of worse overall survival only for previous protocol patients. CONCLUSION: Favorable outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurred using adapted SJCRH protocols, perhaps because of multidisciplinary care teams and improved parent advocacy. Inferior outcomes might be prevented by addressing predictive factors to ameliorate monitoring and care.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Developing country', '*Pediatric ALL', '*Prognostic factor', '*Survival', '*Treatment regimen']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Apr 16.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a horizontally transmitted virus infection of CD4+ lymphocytes which causes adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM). The viral genome encodes two oncoproteins, transactivator protein (Tax) and helix basic zipper protein (HBZ), which are considered tumor initiator and maintenance factors, respectively. Tax is the primary inducer of clonal infected T cell expansion, and genetic instability. The immune response to Tax results in the selection of cells with little or no Tax expression, which have undergone genetic and epigenetic alterations that promote T cell activation, proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. This selection of malignant cells occurs over several decades in 5% of infected individuals. Novel insights into the molecular details of each of these events has led to targeted therapies for ATLL.","['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI126652/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA234640/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6801043,['NIHMS1529418'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

So far, no full-length HTLV-1 genome sequence has been reported from Iran. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of HTLV-1 viruses isolated from adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients from this region. The genome size of HTLV-1-MhD (Mashhad) was found to be 9036bp and sequence analysis of the LTR region showed that it belongs to cosmopolitan subtype A. Comparing the sequences with isolates from another endemic area (HTLV-1ATK) revealed variations in the U3 region (~3.4%), while there was 99.1% and 97.0% similarity in R and U5 regions, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of HTLV-1 gag, pro and pol genes had a difference of 1.1% compared with HTLV-1 ATK with 16 nucleotides replaced in the gag and 27 in the pol regions. There was no variability in the amino acid sequences in the p24(gag), however three residues were different in the p19(gag) and one in the p15(gag). The nucleotide sequence of env showed a divergence of 1.5% compared to ATK with 22-nucleotide variation. The HTLV-1-MhD Tax, p13, p30, and p12 had 99.1, 100, 98.8, and 98%, respectively similarity with the prototype strain. Four amino acid changes were detected in ORF1 and ORF2 products p12 and p30, respectively, while the p13 region showed 100% conservation. The nucleotide identity between the isolates of Mashhad and those isolated from France, Germany, China, Canada and Brazil was 99.1%, 99.2%, 97.9%, 99% and 99.3%, respectively. Four amino acid changes compared with HTLV-1ATK from Japan were detected in ORF1 and ORF2 products p12 and p30, respectively, while the p13 region showed 100% conservation.

A better understanding of resistance mechanisms is yielding new approaches to management of the disease. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm the hallmark of which, the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) oncogene, has been the target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which have significantly improved the survival of patients with CML. However, because of an increase in TKI resistance, it is becoming imperative to identify resistance mechanisms so that drug therapies can be better prescribed and new agents developed.

Epub 2019 May 15.,"To protect tissues and the organism from disease, potentially harmful cells are removed through programmed cell death processes, including apoptosis and necroptosis. These types of cell death are critically controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are short RNA molecules that target and inhibit expression of many cellular regulators, including those controlling programmed cell death via the intrinsic (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), extrinsic (TRAIL and Fas), p53-and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptotic pathways, as well as the necroptosis cell death pathway. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of apoptosis and necroptosis pathways and how these are impaired in cancer cells. We focus on how miRNAs disrupt apoptosis and necroptosis, thereby critically contributing to malignancy. Understanding which and how miRNAs and their targets affect cell death pathways could open up novel therapeutic opportunities for cancer patients. Indeed, restoration of pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor miRNAs (apoptomiRs) or inhibition of oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs) represent strategies that are currently being trialed or are already applied as miRNA-based cancer therapies. Therefore, better understanding the cancer type-specific expression of apoptomiRs and oncomiRs and their underlying mechanisms in cell death pathways will not only advance our knowledge, but also continue to provide new opportunities to treat cancer.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cancer', '*Endoplasmic reticulum stress', '*MicroRNAs', '*Necroptosis']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 27.,"High hyperdiploidy (HD) is the most common cytogenetic subtype of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and a higher incidence of HD has been reported in ALL patients with congenital cancer syndromes. We assessed the frequency of predisposing germline mutations in 57 HD-ALL patients from the California Childhood Leukemia Study via targeted sequencing of cancer-relevant genes. Three out of 57 patients (5.3%) harbored confirmed germline mutations that were likely causal, in NBN, ETV6, and FLT3, with an additional six patients (10.5%) harboring putative predisposing mutations that were rare in unselected individuals (<0.01% allele frequency in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, ExAC) and predicted functional (scaled CADD score >/= 20) in known or potential ALL predisposition genes (SH2B3, CREBBP, PMS2, MLL, ABL1, and MYH9). Three additional patients carried rare and predicted damaging germline mutations in GAB2, a known activator of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways and binding partner of PTPN11-encoded SHP2. The frequency of rare and predicted functional germline GAB2 mutations was significantly higher in our patients (2.6%) than in ExAC (0.28%, P = 4.4 x 10(-3) ), an observation that was replicated in ALL patients from the TARGET project (P = .034). We cloned patient GAB2 mutations and expressed mutant proteins in HEK293 cells and found that frameshift mutation P621fs led to reduced SHP2 binding and ERK1/2 phosphorylation but significantly increased AKT phosphorylation, suggesting possible RAS-independent leukemogenic effects. Our results support a significant contribution of rare, high penetrance germline mutations to HD-ALL etiology, and pinpoint GAB2 as a putative novel ALL predisposition gene.","['R24 ES028524/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'PJT-152995/CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-142374/CIHR/Canada', 'R01 CA155461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6684857,['NIHMS1031238'],['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*FLT3', '*GAB2', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*germline mutations', '*high hyperdiploidy']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4880-7543'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven newly diagnosed AML patients(exclued M3 type) were enrolled in this study. The survival of patients were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical data, laboratory findings and the survival of patients were analyzed and compared between patients with high WT1 expression (high-WT1 group) and those with low WT1 expression (low-WT1 group), as well as among the patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild type and mutants. RESULTS: The overall response rates (ORR) in high-WT1 and low-WT1 groups were 65.9% (83/126) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (P<0.01). Compared with the low-WT1 group, the high-WT1 group had lower 2-y overall survival (OS) rate (46.1% vs. 75.2%, P<0.05) and 2-y disease free survival (DFS) rate (43.5% vs. 68.5%, P<0.05). After induction chemotherapy, the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >/= 1log was associated with higher ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), but the advantage of 2-y DFS rate was not shown (P>0.05). In patients with NPM1 wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), while in the patients with FLT3-ITD wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR, 2-y OS rate and 2-y DFS rate (all P<0.05). In patients with NPM1 or FLT3 -ITD mutations, the WT1 expression had no significantly predicting values in treatment efficacy and survival (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene overexpression indicated poor prognosis of AML patients; the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >/= 1 log after the first induction therapy show better prognosis than those with<1 log. The WT1 gene expression level at diagnosis can be used as an unfavorable prognostic factor for AML patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined that pacritinib, a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor, has in vitro activity against FLT3-ITD and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. Therefore, we conducted a phase I study of pacritinib in combination with chemotherapy in AML patients with FLT3 mutations to determine the pharmacokinetics and preliminary toxicity and clinical activity. Pacritinib was administered at a dose of 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily following a 3 + 3 dose-escalation in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin (cohort A) or with decitabine induction (cohort B). A total of thirteen patients were enrolled (five in cohort A; eight in cohort B). Dose limiting toxicities include hemolytic anemia and grade 3 QTc prolongation in two patients who received 100 mg. Complete remission was achieved in two patients in cohort A, one of whom had a minor D835Y clone at baseline. One patient in cohort B achieved morphologic leukemia free state.

Previously we showed that zebrafish cul4a, but not cul4b, is essential for cardiac and pectoral fin development. Here, we have identified cul4a as a crucial regulator of primitive erythropoiesis in zebrafish embryonic development. Depletion of cul4a resulted in a striking reduction of erythroid cells due to the inhibition of erythroid differentiation. Transcript levels for early hematopoietic regulatory genes including scl, lmo2, and gata1 are significantly reduced in cul4a-deficient embryos. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that scl and gata1, the central regulators of primitive hematopoiesis for erythroid determination, are transcriptionally upregulated by cul4a. These findings demonstrate an important role for cul4a in primitive erythropoiesis and may bear implications in regeneration medicine of anemia and related diseases.",,PMC6525236,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2618-9342'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"SERIES EDITORS' NOTE: Large randomized clinical trials testing the impact of subject-, disease- and transplant-related co-variates on outcomes amongst recipients of haematopoietic cell transplants are uncommon. For example, who is the best donor, which is the best pretransplant conditioning regimen or the best regimen to prevent or treat acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease. To answer these questions we often rely on analyses of data from large observational datasets such as those of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Such analyses have proved extremely important in advancing the field. However, in contrast to randomized trials, we cannot be certain potentially important prognostic or predictive co-variates are balanced between cohorts selected for comparison from an observational dataset, a limitation which can lead to incorrect conclusions. In the typescript which follows the authours describe a method to adjust for known imbalances in co-variates and get a closer approximation of the truth. They give two examples, the impact of a new pretransplant conditioning regimen on disease-free survival (DFS) in subjects with Ewing sarcoma and the impact of donor-type on treatment-related mortality (TRM) and leukaemia relapse in subjects with acute leukaemia. Direct adjusted survival and cumulative incidence function (CIF) analyses are an important step forward. These analyses can be done using available statistical packages and we encourage readers to use them rather than reporting unadjusted analyses. Finally, we must emphasize direct adjustment can only be done for know prognostic or predictive co-variates, not unknown co-variates. Unknown co-variates will be balanced in randomized trials which is why we do them. So direct adjustment is an important step forward but not a perfect substitute for randomized trials. But any step forward is important.

Treatment protocols, primarily based on the anchor drug Cytarabine, remained chiefly unchanged in the past 50 years with no standardized salvage regimens. Herein we aimed at exploring potential pre-clinical treatment strategies to surmount Cytarabine resistance in human AML cells. We established Cytarabine-resistant sublines derived from human leukemia K562 and Kasumi cells, and characterized the expression of Cytarabine-related genes using real-time PCR and Western blot analyses to uncover the mechanisms underlying their Cytarabine resistance. This was followed by growth inhibition assays and isobologram analyses testing the sublines' sensitivity to the clinically approved drugs hydroxyurea (HU) and azidothymidine (AZT), compared to their parental cells. All Cytarabine-resistant sublines lost deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) expression, rendering them refractory to Cytarabine. Loss of dCK function involved dCK gene deletions and/or a novel frameshift mutation leading to dCK transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. Cytarabine-resistant sublines displayed hypersensitivity to HU and AZT compared to parental cells; HU and AZT combinations exhibited a marked synergistic growth inhibition effect on leukemic cells, which was intensified upon acquisition of Cytarabine-resistance. In contrast, HU and AZT combination showed an antagonistic effect in non-malignant cells. Finally, HU and AZT synergism was demonstrated on peripheral blood specimens from AML patients. These findings identify a promising HU and AZT combination for the possible future treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, while sparing normal tissues from untoward toxicity.",,PMC6525253,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6692-8221'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients' and disease characteristics of the two groups were similar except that recipients of matched unrelated donor transplantation were more likely to have poor risk cytogenetics and more likely to receive myeloablative conditioning regimens. Time from documented remission to transplant did not differ by donor type. Five-year overall survival was 32% and 42% after haploidentical and matched unrelated donor transplant, respectively (P=0.04). Multivariable analysis showed higher mortality (hazard ratio 1.27, P=0.04) and relapse (hazard ratio 1.32, P=0.04) after haploidentical transplantation, with similar non-relapse mortality risks.

Expression of BCR-ABL1(p210/T315I) resulted in a severe distortion of the ommatidial architecture of adult eyes with a more prominent rough eye phenotype compared to milder phenotypes in BCR-ABL1(p210) reflecting a stronger oncogenic potential of the mutant. We then assessed the efficacy of the currently used tyrosine kinase inhibitors in BCR-ABL1(p210) and BCR-ABL1(p210/T315I) expressing flies. Treatment of BCR-ABL1(p210) expressing flies with potent kinase inhibitors (dasatinib and ponatinib) resulted in the rescue of ommatidial loss and the restoration of normal development. Taken together, we provide a chronic myeloid leukemia tailored BCR-ABL1(p210) and BCR-ABL1(p210/T315I) fly model which can be used to test new compounds with improved therapeutic indices.",['P40 OD018537/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7012492,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Low pH inactivation of enveloped viruses has historically been shown to be an effective viral inactivation step in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. To date, most statistical analyses supporting modular low pH viral inactivation claims have used descriptive statistical analyses, which in many cases do not allow for probabilistic characterization of future experimental log10 reduction values (LRVs). Using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression modeling, probability statements regarding the likelihood of successful low pH viral inactivation based on only certain process parameter settings can be derived. This type of analysis also permits statistical modeling in the presence of historical data from different experiments and right-censored data, two issues that have not as yet been satisfactorily dealt with in the literature. The characterization of the probability of successful inactivation allows creation of a modular claim stating future LRVs will be greater than or equal to some critical value, based on only certain process parameter settings of the viral inactivation unit operation. This risk-based approach, when used in conjunction with traditional descriptive statistics, facilitates coherent and cogent decision-making about modular viral clearance LRV claims.LAY ABSTRACT: Viral contamination of biologically derived drug products is a safety concern for both regulatory agencies and drug manufacturers. Validation of the removal and inactivation of model viruses is required to ensure the safety of patients receiving these drugs, and dedicated steps, including viral filtration and chemical inactivation, are often added to manufacturing processes to provide additional clearance and inactivation capabilities. One of these steps, low pH inactivation, exposes enveloped viruses to a low pH environment to reduce the potential of the virus to infect host cells. Because the viral inactivation capability of this well-understood unit operation has been demonstrated for years across many different biological drugs, many companies have begun investigating the use of the modular viral clearance claim for the low pH inactivation step. Modular claims ensure, without experimentation, that a certain level of reduction of virus will occur if specific parameters are used in the manufacturing process, allowing manufacturers to save both time and resources in the early developmental phases of biologically derived drugs. A novel type of statistical analysis is outlined in this article that when used in addition to previously used analyses allows drug manufacturers to estimate a more valid level of virus reduction in modular viral clearance claims.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Generic claim', '*Log reduction value (LRV)', '*Low pH inactivation', '*Modular claim', '*Modular viral clearance', '*Murine leukemia virus (MuLV)', '*Retrovirus', '*Viral clearance', '*Viral inactivation', '*Viral safety']",,"['(c) PDA, Inc. 2019.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"The BioPhorum Development Group Viral Clearance Workstream performed a collaborative retrospective analysis to evaluate packed bed chromatographic resin performance after repeated cycling for two commonly used chromatography steps in biopharmaceutical manufacturing: protein A and anion exchange. Key variables evaluated in the assessment included virus type, resin type, number of reuse cycles, and virus challenge. In this retrospective analysis of viral clearance data on naive versus cycled resin, powered by the availability of a decade's worth of accumulated industry data, clearance capability was not negatively impacted by resin cycling. This finding is consistent with publications showing that surrogates for viral clearance capabilities could be employed in lieu of testing the viral clearance of cycled resins for protein A and anion exchange chromatography. The rigorous analysis of the retrospective data supports the view that viral clearance studies for cycled resins are not necessary provided that appropriate cleaning methods are applied during repeated use of the chromatography columns.LAY ABSTRACT: The manufacturing processes for biopharmaceutical products often include reusable chromatographic resins that remove process- and product-related impurities as well as potential contaminating viruses. Typically, chromatography resin is ""cycled"" through repeated steps of resin conditioning, product purification, and resin cleaning. The cycling approach has been evaluated in both small- and full-scale studies that show the performance parameters are maintained. The ability to remove virus is demonstrated separately in a focused small-scale virus-spiking study that is resource-intensive and costly. This paper is a retrospective review of industry data comparing virus removal by naive and repeatedly cycled resins that summarizes the viral clearance impact of re-using protein A and anion exchange chromatography resins. The key variables evaluated in the assessment included virus type, resin type, number of cycles, and virus challenge. In this retrospective analysis, it was found that the viral clearance capability is not negatively impacted by resin cycling. This finding is consistent with other publications and supports the view that viral clearance studies for cycled resins are not necessary if appropriate cleaning methods are applied during the repeated use of the chromatography columns.Abbreviations: AAV-2, Adeno-associated virus; A-MuLV, Amphotropic murine leukemia virus; AEX, Anion-exchange chromatography; B/E, Bind and elute; BVDV, Bovine viral diarrhea virus; C.P.G., Controlled pore glass; DEAE, Diethylaminoethanol; EMCV, Encephalomyocarditis virus; FT, Flow through; HAV, Hepatitis A virus; HSV-1, Herpes simplex virus type 1; LOD, Limit of detection; LOQ, Limit of quantification; LRF, Log10 reduction factor; mAb, Monoclonal antibody; MVM, Minute virus of mice; NaOH, Sodium hydroxide; PA, Protein A; PPV, Porcine parvovirus; QA, Quaternary amine; QP, Quaternized polyethyleneimine; qPCR, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Reo3, Reovirus type 3; SuHV-1, Suid herpesvirus; SV40, Simian virus 40; X-MuLV, Xenotropic murine leukemia virus.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anion exchange', '*Packed bed chromatography', '*Protein A', '*Resin reuse', '*Viral clearance']",,"['(c) PDA, Inc. 2019.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Drug allergies occur when hapten-like drug metabolites conjugated to serum proteins, through their interactions with specific IgE, trigger allergic reactions that can be life threatening. A molecule termed covalent heterobivalent inhibitor (cHBI) was designed to specifically target drug hapten-specific IgE to prevent it from binding drug-haptenated serum proteins. cHBI binds the two independent sites on a drug hapten-specific Ab and covalently conjugates only to the specific IgE, permanently inhibiting it. The cHBI design was evaluated via ELISA to measure cHBI-IgE binding, degranulation assays of rat basophil leukemia cells for in vitro efficacy, and mouse models of ear swelling and systemic anaphylaxis responses for in vivo efficacy. The cHBI design was evaluated using two separate models: one specific to inhibit penicillin G-reactive IgE and another to inhibit IgE specific to a model compound, dansyl. We show that cHBI conjugated specifically to its target Ab and inhibited degranulation in cellular degranulation assays using rat basophil leukemia cells. Furthermore, cHBIs demonstrated in vivo inhibition of allergic responses in both murine models. We establish the cHBI design to be a versatile platform for inhibiting hapten/IgE interactions, which can potentially be applied to inhibit IgE-mediated allergic reactions to any drug/small-molecule allergy.","['R01 AI108884/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI129241/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA082709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106846/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6823631,['NIHMS1528130'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2208-0174', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3554-4449', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2923-8245']","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether VEN plus anti-CD20 (VENcombo) is superior to VENmono is unknown. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis comparing 321 CLL patients treated with VENmono vs VENcombo across the United States and the United Kingdom. We examined demographics, baseline characteristics, dosing, adverse events, response rates, and outcomes. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, in patients treated with VENmono vs VENcombo. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed with COX regression. Three hundred twenty-one CLL patients were included (3 median prior treatments, 78% prior ibrutinib). The overall response rates (ORRs) were similar (VENmono, 81% ORR, 34% complete remission [CR] vs VENcombo, 84% ORR, 32% CR). With a median follow-up of 13.4 months, no differences in PFS and OS were observed between the groups. In unadjusted analyses, the hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS and OS for VENmono vs VENcombo were HR 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.8; P = .7) and HR 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6-2.3; P = .5), respectively. When adjusting for differences between the cohorts, the addition of an anti-CD20 antibody in combination with VEN did not impact PFS (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.0; P = .9) or OS (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-2.6; P = .8).

Epub 2019 May 17.,"We have previously demonstrated that oxidative phosphorylation is required for the survival of human leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). More recently, we demonstrated that LSCs in patients with de novo AML rely on amino acid metabolism to drive oxidative phosphorylation. Notably, although overall levels of amino acids contribute to LSC energy metabolism, our current findings suggest that cysteine may be of particular importance for LSC survival. We demonstrate that exogenous cysteine is metabolized exclusively to glutathione. Upon cysteine depletion, glutathione synthesis is impaired, leading to reduced glutathionylation of succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA), a key component of electron transport chain complex (ETC) II. Loss of SDHA glutathionylation impairs ETC II activity, thereby inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, reducing production of ATP, and leading to LSC death. Given the role of cysteine in driving LSC energy production, we tested cysteine depletion as a potential therapeutic strategy. Using a novel cysteine-degrading enzyme, we demonstrate selective eradication of LSCs, with no detectable effect on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Together, these findings indicate that LSCs are aberrantly reliant on cysteine to sustain energy metabolism, and that targeting this axis may represent a useful therapeutic strategy.",['R01 CA200707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6659257,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2258-6490', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3000-083X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7296-4963', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6519-4860']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Jul 25;134(4):336-338.

Epub 2019 May 14.,"INTRODUCTION: The treatment-related mortality in currently published studies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children is 2-4%, mainly due to infections. The aim of the study was to analyse the incidence, epidemiology, profile of infection and the death rate in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis included 1363 patients, aged 1-18 years, with newly diagnosed ALL, who were treated in 17 pediatric hematology centers between 2012 and 2017 in Poland. The patients received therapy according to the ALL IC-BFM 2002 and 2009 (International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group) protocols. RESULTS: In our study, 726 out of 1363 (53.2%) children were reported to have a microbiologically documented bacterial infection during chemotherapy. 1511 episodes of these infection were diagnosed. A total number of 251/1363 (18.4%) children experienced a viral infection. 304 episodes were documented by PCR test (polymerase chain reaction). A fungal infection was reported in 278 (20.4%) children, including 10.1% of probable, 6.0% of proven, 83% of possible diagnosis. A higher frequency of fungal infection was noted in the recent years. In our material, the rate of death was 2.4%, mainly due to fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results present the epidemiology of infectious disease in the Polish ALL patient population. The most frequent were bacterial infections, followed by fungal and viral ones. Similar to the previously published data, the mortality rate in our material was 2.4%.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Children', 'Infection']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

The age-adjusted incidence of AML is 4.3 per 100,000 annually in the United States (US). Incidence increases with age with a median age at diagnosis of 68years in the US. The etiology of AML is heterogeneous. In some patients, prior exposure to therapeutic, occupational or environmental DNA-damaging agents is implicated, but most cases of AML remain without a clear etiology. AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and has the shortest survival (5-year survival=24%). Curative therapies, including intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, are generally applicable to a minority of patients who are younger and fit, while most older individuals exhibit poor prognosis and survival. Differences in patient outcomes are influenced by disease characteristics, access to care including active therapies and supportive care, and other factors. After many years without therapeutic advances, several new therapies have been approved and are expected to impact patient outcomes, especially for older patients and those with refractory disease.",['P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Epidemiology', '*Etiology', '*Incidence', '*Mortality', '*Survival']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

The completeness of reporting infectious complications in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatments for haematological malignancies is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the completeness of reporting infectious complications in RCTs assessing treatments for haematological malignancies. DATA SOURCE: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed database. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: All primary published phase II/III RCTs between September 2016 and September 2018 evaluating treatments for haematological malignancies in adult patients were included. INTERVENTION: Reporting infectious complications. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the completeness of reporting. Study characteristics and data concerning reporting of infectious complications were collected by two independent reviewers. Quality of reporting was assessed using a modification of the CONSORT extension checklist for harms, including 15 items. RESULTS: One-hundred and seven RCTs were included. Most trials (97; 91%) provided some report on infections. Approximately half reported on each of pneumonia, sepsis and neutropenic fever; 12 trials (11%) reported on fungal infections. Only nine trials (8%) listed infections by type of pathogen (i.e. bacterial, fungal or viral) and 48 (45%) by source/type of infection (i.e. pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc.). Most trials did not address infections in their title, abstract, introduction or discussion. Median number of items of the CONSORT modification reported was 7 points, (interquartile range (IQR) 6-9) for all included trials, with lower median for 34 acute leukaemia trials (median 6, IQR 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Most trials evaluating treatment for haematological malignancies provide some data relating to infectious complications. The reports are mostly incomplete and rarely provided in a structured presentation.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CONSORT', 'CONSORT harms', 'Haematological malignancies', 'Randomized controlled trials']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

The success seen with these drugs in MS, and their various mechanisms of action, has led to them being investigated in other neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review article summarises the ongoing and completed studies of MS drugs in neurological and psychiatric conditions other than MS. The most promising results are for interferon beta in human T cell leukaemia virus 1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and glioma, and for fingolimod in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage.

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Uncertainty is a crucial issue in statistics which can be considered from different points of view. One type of uncertainty, typically referred to as sampling uncertainty, arises through the variability of results obtained when the same analysis strategy is applied to different samples. Another type of uncertainty arises through the variability of results obtained when using the same sample but different analysis strategies addressing the same research question. We denote this latter type of uncertainty as method uncertainty. It results from all the choices to be made for an analysis, for example, decisions related to data preparation, method choice, or model selection. In medical sciences, a large part of omics research is focused on the identification of molecular biomarkers, which can either be performed through ranking or by selection from among a large number of candidates. In this paper, we introduce a general resampling-based framework to quantify and compare sampling and method uncertainty. For illustration, we apply this framework to different scenarios related to the selection and ranking of omics biomarkers in the context of acute myeloid leukemia: variable selection in multivariable regression using different types of omics markers, the ranking of biomarkers according to their predictive performance, and the identification of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. For all three scenarios, our findings suggest highly unstable results when the same analysis strategy is applied to two independent samples, indicating high sampling uncertainty and a comparatively smaller, but non-negligible method uncertainty, which strongly depends on the methods being compared.","['BO3139/2-3/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'BO3139/4-2/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'BO3139/6-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', '01IS18036A/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*high-dimensional data', '*resampling', '*stability', '*variable ranking', '*variable selection']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7857-1263', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2729-0947']","['(c) 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Homeobox A9 (HOXA9) is an oncogene in leukemia and has been implicated in CRC pathology, although its role in disease etiology remains obscure at best. We observe that HOXA9 expression is increased in colonic adenomas compared with location-matched healthy colon epithelium. Its forced expression results in dramatic genetic and signaling changes, with increased expression of growth factors IGF1 and FLT3, super-activity of the AKT survival pathway and a concomitant increase in compartment size. Furthermore, a reduced mRNA expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition marker N-cadherin as well as reduced activity of the actin cytoskeletal mediator PAK was seen, which is in apparent agreement with an observed reduced migratory response in HOXA9-overexpressing cells. Thus, HOXA9 appears closely linked with adenoma growth while impairing migration and metastasis and hence is both a marker and driver of premalignant polyp growth. Colonic polyps grow but remain premalignant for up to decades. Here, we show that HOXA9 drives growth in premalignant polyps, but simultaneously prevents further transformation.",,,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Epub 2019 May 17.,"The treatment landscape for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rapidly evolving, with multiple agents recently approved. They include a glycoengineered monoclonal antibody (obinutuzumab), B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors (ibrutinib, idelalisib, and duvelisib), and the BCL-2 inhibitor (venetoclax). These compounds are dramatically changing the natural course of the disease. Nonetheless, despite improved survival rates, particularly in higher-risk disease (older adults, patients with unmutated IGHV, del(11q), and del(17p)/TP53 mutated), there is still room for progress. Given the panoply of highly effective therapies commercially available, it is important to define a tailored treatment strategy for this heterogeneous condition that considers balance of treatment efficacy versus toxicity or tolerance. This article summarizes the most promising clinical advances by reviewing the data from recent clinical trials and discussing meaningful clinical endpoints, including the role of minimal residual disease assessment. The recent development of therapies targeting dysregulated pathways is revolutionary and may ultimately lead us to not only achieve prolonged remission durations but also envision the possibility of a functional cure for a larger population of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Most patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are at least age 65 and continue to have short survival, with many patients receiving no specific anti-AML therapy, particularly if they are older than age 75. Although consensus regarding optimal treatment of this growing population is lacking, treatment options are expanding even for the oldest patients. A fundamental question when seeing an older patient with AML is whether to recommend ""more intensive"" or ""less intensive"" induction therapy. Existing data can support more intensive treatment strategies for selected older adults, although there is growing evidence to support less intensive therapies as well. Randomized trials to provide clear comparisons between treatment strategies among well-characterized older adult populations are lacking. Reliance on age alone to determine treatment choice is problematic, as ""fitness"" or ""unfitness"" varies dramatically among patients of the same chronologic age and remains poorly characterized in existing studies. This article will provide differing perspectives on the ""more"" versus ""less"" question, with particular attention to recent drug approvals. Issues relevant to both treatment decision-making in practice and alternative trial design to inform gaps in knowledge will be discussed. Given the heterogeneity, an important conclusion will be that there is unlikely to be a single best approach and that appropriate decision-making requires considerations of many factors specific to individual patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we discuss the use of these newly approved therapies. Advances in AML have also occurred through development of better tools to assess response to treatment. Both multiparameter flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction can be used to assess for the presence or absence of measurable residual disease (MRD) and increase the sensitivity of response assessment.

We independently searched nine bibliometric databases for reviews and longitudinal studies published up to 26 October 2018, and assessed the quality of studies meeting inclusion criteria. We identified 3893 records and screened 3037 eligible studies, read four full-texts and extracted data from three randomized control trials. Two studies examined a diet-only intervention for weight management, while one study examined a mixed intervention for diet and exercise. Overall, existing evidence is of poor quality and based on small feasibility studies of either paediatric leukaemia or female lupus patients, which suggested divergent effects of lifestyle interventions on weight, body mass index or waist circumference. Current evidence suggests a state of clinical equipoise that deserves greater research attention given the prevalent use of corticosteroids for treating a variety of chronic conditions. Robust high-quality longitudinal studies to decipher preventive strategies of steroid-induced weight gain must be prioritized in research and policy to improve patient care and prevent further obesity-related disease burden.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['corticosteroids', 'lifestyle interventions', 'obesity prevention', 'review', 'weight change']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6532-8790', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2162-3859']",['(c) 2019 World Obesity Federation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 17.,"INTRODUCTION: Cytogenetics and molecular testings for disease classifying and prognosis estimation are becoming routine in clinical practice. However, the molecular characteristics of acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between karyotypes and gene mutations, especially in AML-M5 patients with 11q23/KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement and normal karyotype. METHODS: A total of 126 de novo AML-M5 patients were screened for mutations in the 51 genes known or suspected to have a role in myeloid malignancies or in monocytic differentiation using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Chromosome karyotype analysis was performed by R-banding method and further confirmed either by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or by multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiple RT-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 126 patients, one or more mutations were detected in 83.3% patients. FLT3-ITD and NRAS had the highest mutation frequency, followed by NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, KRAS, and RUNX1. We also identified a significant difference in mutational spectrums between KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar) patients and normal karyotype (NK) patients, as reflected in the average number of gene mutations per patient (1.66 vs 2.46), and in the frequencies of commonly mutated genes (FLT3-ITD: 6% vs 43.5%; NPM1: 0% vs 43.5%; RUNX1: 2.0% vs 15.2%; DNMT3A: 4% vs 26.1%; KRAS: 24.0% vs 4.35%). Patients harboring >/=3 mutations showed much lower complete remission rate than that with double mutations (P = 0.043) in high-risk group. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly different mutation profile between KMT2Ar-patients and NK patients. Our research provided new insight into the molecular characteristics of AML-M5.","['CJ20140060/Applied Basic Research Project of Changzhou City', '81500103/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2A rearrangement', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'next-generation sequencing', 'normal karyotype']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8917-4792', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3836-9260']",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite technological advances in the field of medicine and our heightened knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of AML, the initial therapy of ""7+3"" Cytarabine and Daunorubicin has remained mainly unchanged since 1973. AML is a disease of the elderly, and increased morbidity in this patient group does not allow the full use of the treatment and drug-resistant relapse is common. Nanocarriers are drug-delivery systems that can be used to transport drugs to the bone marrow and target Leukemic Stem Cells (LSC), conferring less side-effects compared to the free-drug alternative. Nanocarriers also can be used to favour the transport of drugs that otherwise would not have been used clinically due to toxicity and poor efficacy. Liposomes are a type of nanocarrier that can be used as a dedicated drug delivery system, which can also have active ligands on the surface in order to interact with antigens on the target cells or tissues. In addition to using small molecules, it is possible to attach antibodies to the liposome surface, generating so-called immunoliposomes. By using immunoliposomes as a drug-delivery system, it is possible to minimize the toxic side effects caused by the chemotherapeutic drug on healthy organs, and at the same time direct the drugs towards the remaining AML blasts and stem cells. This article aims to explore the possibilities of using immunoliposomes as a drug carrier in AML therapy. Emphasis will be on possible target molecules on the AML cells, leukaemic stem cells, as well as bone marrow constituents relevant to AML therapy. Further, some conditions and precautions that must be met for immunoliposomes to be used in AML therapy will be discussed.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'antibodies', 'bone marrow', 'immunoliposomes', 'liposomes', 'pharmacy', 'production.']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"BACKGROUND: Asparaginase is a critical component of lymphoblastic leukemia therapy, with intravenous pegaspargase (PEG) as the current standard product. Acute adverse events (aAEs) during PEG infusion are difficult to interpret, representing a mix of drug-inactivating hypersensitivity and noninactivating reactions. Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (ERW) is approved for PEG hypersensitivity, but is less convenient, more expensive, and yields lower serum asparaginase activity (SAA). We began a policy of universal premedication and SAA testing for PEG, hypothesizing this would reduce aAEs and unnecessary drug substitutions. PROCEDURE: Retrospective chart review of patients receiving asparaginase before and after universal premedication before PEG was conducted, with SAA performed 1 week later. We excluded patients who had nonallergic asparaginase AEs. Primary end point was substitution to ERW. Secondary end points included aAEs, SAA testing, and cost. RESULTS: We substituted to ERW in 21 of 122 (17.2%) patients pre-policy, and 5 of 68 (7.4%) post-policy (RR, 0.427; 95% CI, 0.27-0.69, P = 0.028). All completed doses of PEG yielded excellent SAA (mean, 0.90 units/mL), compared with ERW (mean, 0.15 units/mL). PEG inactivation post-policy was seen in 2 of 68 (2.9%), one silent and one with breakthrough aAE. The rate of aAEs pre/post-policy was 17.2% versus 5.9% (RR, 0.342; 95% CI, 0.20-0.58, P = 0.017). Grade 4 aAE rate pre/post-policy was 15% versus 0%. Cost analysis predicts $125 779 drug savings alone per substitution prevented ($12 402/premedicated patient). CONCLUSIONS: Universal premedication reduced substitutions to ERW and aAE rate. SAA testing demonstrated low rates of silent inactivation, and higher SAA for PEG. A substantial savings was achieved. We propose universal premedication for PEG be standard of care.","['T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA60441/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8294186,['NIHMS1718135'],['NOTNLM'],"['*asparaginase', '*leukemia', '*premedication', '*therapeutic drug monitoring']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8507-3732'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We pilot tested ""Delta,"" an online and booklet decision aid for parents with a child with cancer, and adolescents with cancer, deciding whether or not to enrol in a clinical trial. METHODS: We developed Delta in accordance with the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. We conducted a pre-post pilot with parents with a child, and adolescents, who had enrolled in a paediatric phase III clinical trial for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Parents (n = 37) and adolescents (n = 3) completed a questionnaire before and after using Delta (either the website or booklet, based on their preference). RESULTS: Twenty-three parents (62.2%) and three adolescents (100%) reviewed the Delta website. Parents rated Delta as highly acceptable in regard to being clearly presented, informative, easy to read, useful, visually appealing, and easy to use. All participants reported that they would recommend Delta to others and that it would have been useful when making their decision. Parents' subjective (Mdiff= 10.8, SDdiff = 15.69, P < .001) and objective (OR = 2.25, 95% CI, 1.66-3.04; P < .001) clinical trial knowledge increased significantly after reviewing Delta. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Delta is the first reported decision aid, available online and as a booklet, for parents and adolescents deciding whether or not to enrol in a paediatric oncology clinical trial.

To identify patients who require VCAP-AMP-VECP, we conducted a supplementary analysis of JCOG9801. Overall, 105 patients were included and categorized into low- (n = 44), intermediate- (n = 54) and high-risk (n = 7) groups according to the age-adjusted ATL prognostic index (ATL-PI). We excluded the high-risk group due to small numbers of patients. VCAP-AMP-VECP did not show any superior trend for overall survival (OS) in the low-risk group (hazard ratio: 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 0.54-2.04). Better OS was observed in the intermediate-risk group treated with VCAP-AMP-VECP (hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.36-1.19). In the intermediate-risk group, the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm showed higher complete response rates than the CHOP-14 arm (44.0% vs. 13.8%). The VCAP-AMP-VECP arm in both risk groups exhibited grade 4 thrombocytopenia, while grade 4 neutropenia was only observed in the intermediate-risk group.

However, the lack of efficient delivery methods for synthetic miRNA inhibitors, antagomiR, or anti-miR oligonucleotides hindered clinical translation of such strategies. We recently developed an approach for targeted delivery of synthetic, 2'-O-methyl-modified antagomiR molecules to normal and malignant myeloid cells and B cells by tethering to the single-stranded, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PSO). The PSO-antagomiR are rapidly internalized through scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis by human monocytes, dendritic cells, B cells, as well as myeloid leukemia and B-cell lymphoma cells, but not by T cells. Following internalization, the unformulated PSO-antagomiR potently reduces levels of target miRNA and modulates expression of downstream protein targets, both in vitro and in vivo. The simple design of PSO-antagomiR conjugates enable adaptation of this strategy for targeting oncogenic miRNAs in nonmalignant and malignant myeloid cells and B cells.",['R01 CA213131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AntagomiR', '*Anti-miR', '*Leukemia', '*MicroRNA', '*Myeloid cells', '*Oligonucleotides', '*miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is associated with poor response to the following chemotherapy in lymphoid malignancies, such as lymphoma and leukemia. However, it remains unclear whether GCs interfere with the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs on GC-resistant cells. In this study, we examined whether GCs affected the sensitivities to vincristine (VCR)/doxorubicin (DOX) and the expression of drug transporters in GC-resistant cells. The dexamethasone (DEX)/prednisolone (PSL)-resistant lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell lines Raji and HL60 were cultured with DEX for 7 days and then treated with VCR or DOX for 3 days. Seven days of DEX treatment increased the IC50s of both VCR and DOX in Raji cells but not in HL60 cells. The mRNA and protein expression levels of organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN) 2, one of the drug uptake transporters expressed in both cell lines, were decreased only in Raji cells. When Raji cells were cultured with PSL, the IC50 of DOX but not VCR increased as the expression of OCTN2 decreased. No significant increases in efflux transporter expression were induced by DEX or PSL. When siRNA against OCTN2 was introduced into Raji cells, the IC50 of DOX but not VCR increased significantly. These data suggested that both DEX and PSL decreased the sensitivity of the DEX/PSL-resistant Raji cells to DOX, a change that was at least partially due to reductions in OCTN2. Thus, the continuous usage of GCs may interfere with the effects of chemotherapy on GC-resistant lymphoid cells.","['MO23591400/Grants from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research', 'MO24590325/Grants from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Doxorubicin', 'Glucocorticoid', 'Lymphoid malignancies', 'OCTN2', 'Transporter']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5121-5130'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have identified LITAF as a potential tumor suppressor in several neoplasms, including prostate cancer, B-NHL, acute myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer. However, the expression and function of LITAF in human glioma remain unexplained. The present study aimed to analyze the regulation of LITAF in gliomas. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that LITAF mRNA expression in glioma tissues was higher than that in normal brain tissues, and lower LITAF expression in gliomas showed a good prognosis in patients who received radiotherapy, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In our collected specimens, however, LITAF showed low expression in glioma tissues compared to that in the normal brain tissue. Proliferation and apoptosis of glioma cells were not affected by knockdown or overexpression of LITAF in glioma U251, U373, and U87 cells, but LITAF was able to enhance the radiosensitivity of glioma cells. Furthermore, we found that LITAF enhanced radiosensitivity via FoxO1 and its specific downstream targets BIM, TRAIL, and FASLG. Taken together, our present results demonstrate that LITAF expression is decreased in glioma tissues and might enhance radiosensitivity of glioma cells via upregulation of the FoxO1 pathway.",['81372408/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'FoxO1', 'Glioma', 'LITAF', 'Proliferation', 'Radiosensitivity']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7029-0627'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the effects of CPX-351, a liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin, on cardiac repolarization. METHODS: Twenty-six adults with acute leukemia were treated with CPX-351 for 1-2 induction cycles and </= 4 consolidation cycles. The primary endpoint was mean change in QTcF from baseline. RESULTS: Mean QTcF changes were < 10 ms at all time points. No clinically meaningful effects on heart rate, QRS interval, PR interval, or QTcB were observed. Estimated mean half-lives for total cytarabine and daunorubicin were > 30 h. Thirteen (50%) patients achieved remission. The most common adverse events were febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: The cytarabine and daunorubicin in CPX-351 liposomes were metabolized and excreted similarly to conventional formulation; however, plasma pharmacokinetics were altered. CPX-351 did not prolong the QT interval, suggesting that CPX-351 may induce less cardiotoxicity than previously reported for conventional daunorubicin.

Epub 2019 May 17.,"Acute leukemia is a malignant clonal disease of hematopoietic stem cells with a high prevalence and mortality rate. However, there are no efficient tools to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. Therefore, development of new methods for the early diagnosis and prevention of leukemia, especially non-invasive diagnosis at the cellular level, is imperative. Here, a label-free signal-on fluorescence aptasensor based on terbium(iii)-aptamer (Tb(3+)-apt) was applied for the detection of leukemia. The aptamer sensitizes the fluorescence of Tb(3+) and forms the strong fluorescent Tb(3+)-apt probe. The target cells, the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) combined with the Tb(3+)-apt probe to form the Tb(3+)-apt-CEM complex, were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing a small amount of the Tb(3+)-apt probe was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The logarithm of cell concentration showed a good linear relationship (R(2) = 0.9881) with the fluorescence signal. The linear range for CCRF-CEM detection was 5-5 x 10(6) cells per ml, while the detection limit was 5 cells per ml of the binding buffer. Clinical samples were collected from 100 cases, and the specificity and positive rates detected by this method were up to 94% and 90%, respectively. Therefore, a single-stranded DNA-sensitized terbium(iii) luminescence method diagnostic was developed which is rapid, sensitive, and economical and can be used for diagnosis of various types of leukemia at the early stage.",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9135-7923'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By curating experimental data from published literature, we identified eight functional modules involving Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and its interacting proteins that regulate neuronal migration. We then identified miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) that form functional feedback loops and regulate gene expression of the DISC1 interactome. Using this curated data, we conducted in-silico modeling of the DISC1 interactome involved in neuronal migration and identified the proteins that either facilitate or inhibit neuronal migrational processes. We also studied the effect of perturbation of miRNAs and TFs in feedback loops on the DISC1 interactome. From these analyses, we discovered that STAT3, TCF3, and TAL1 (through feedback loop with miRNAs) play a critical role in the transcriptional control of DISC1 interactome thereby regulating neuronal migration. To the best of our knowledge, regulation of the DISC1 interactome mediating neuronal migration by these TFs has not been previously reported. These potentially important TFs can serve as targets for undertaking validation studies, which in turn can reveal the molecular processes that cause neuronal migration defects underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. This underscores the importance of the use of in-silico techniques in aiding the discovery of mechanistic evidence governing important molecular and cellular processes. The present work is one such step towards the discovery of regulatory factors of the DISC1 interactome that mediates neuronal migration.","['P50 MH094268/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH092443/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH105660/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH107730/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6504871,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Computational biology and bioinformatics', '*Logic gates', '*Neuroscience']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6756-0297', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3528-7721', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1930-1167']",,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Although the over-expression of angiogenic factors is reported in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the poor response to anti-VEGF drugs observed in clinical trials suggests that angiogenesis in these tumours might be driven by VEGF-independent pathways. We show that sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1), which generates the potent bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is over-expressed in DLBCL. A meta-analysis of over 2000 cases revealed that genes correlated with SPHK1 mRNA expression in DLBCL were significantly enriched for tumour angiogenesis meta-signature genes; an effect evident in both major cell of origin (COO) and stromal subtypes. Moreover, we found that S1P induces angiogenic signalling and a gene expression programme that is present within the tumour vasculature of SPHK1-expressing DLBCL. Importantly, S1PR1 functional antagonists, including Siponimod, and the S1P neutralising antibody, Sphingomab, inhibited S1P signalling in DLBCL cells in vitro. Furthermore, Siponimod, also reduced angiogenesis and tumour growth in an S1P-producing mouse model of angiogenic DLBCL. Our data define a potential role for S1P signalling in driving an angiogenic gene expression programme in the tumour vasculature of DLBCL and suggest novel opportunities to target S1P-mediated angiogenesis in patients with DLBCL.","['10066/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'R01 GM043880/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'C7845/A17723/Cancer Research UK (CRUK)/International']",PMC6887546,['EMS82471'],,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6584-5889', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3250-0582', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1288-6999']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High risk subtypes continue to have poor outcomes with event free survival rates <40% despite the use of high intensity chemotherapy in combination with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Here we combine high-throughput screening, intracellular accumulation assays, and in vivo efficacy studies to identify therapeutic strategies for pediatric AML. We report therapeutics not currently used to treat AML, gemcitabine and cabazitaxel, have broad anti-leukemic activity across subtypes and are more effective relative to the AML standard of care, cytarabine, both in vitro and in vivo. JAK inhibitors are selective for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and significantly prolong survival in multiple preclinical models.

Print 2020.,"RAS-signaling mutations induce the myelomonocytic differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, they are important players in the development of myeloid neoplasias. RAF kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a negative regulator of RAS-signaling. As RKIP loss has recently been described in RAS-mutated myelomonocytic acute myeloid leukemia, we now aimed to analyze its role in myelomonocytic differentiation and RAS-driven leukemogenesis. Therefore, we initially analyzed RKIP expression during human and murine hematopoietic differentiation and observed that it is high in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and lymphoid cells but decreases in cells belonging to the myeloid lineage. By employing short hairpin RNA knockdown experiments in CD34(+) umbilical cord blood cells and the undifferentiated acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, we show that RKIP loss is indeed functionally involved in myelomonocytic lineage commitment and drives the myelomonocytic differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These results could be confirmed in vivo, where Rkip deletion induced a myelomonocytic differentiation bias in mice by amplifying the effects of granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. We further show that RKIP is of relevance for RAS-driven myelomonocytic leukemogenesis by demonstrating that Rkip deletion aggravates the development of a myeloproliferative disease in Nras(G12D) -mutated mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that RKIP loss increases the activity of the RAS-MAPK/ERK signaling module. Finally, we prove the clinical relevance of these findings by showing that RKIP loss is a frequent event in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and that it co-occurs with RAS-signaling mutations. Taken together, these data establish RKIP as novel player in RAS-driven myeloid leukemogenesis.",['P 26619/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC7012480,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease with heterogeneous clinical and biological characteristics. Differences in Ca(2+) levels among cases, both basal and upon B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, may reflect heterogeneity in the pathogenesis due to cell-intrinsic factors. Our aim was to elucidate cell-intrinsic differences between BCR-responsive and -unresponsive cases. We therefore determined BCR responsiveness ex vivo based on Ca(2+) influx upon alpha-IgM stimulation of purified CLL cell fractions from 52 patients. Phosphorylation levels of various BCR signaling molecules, and expression of activation markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Transcription profiling of responsive (n=6) and unresponsive cases (n=6) was performed by RNA sequencing. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to validate transcript level differences in a larger cohort. In 24 cases an alpha-IgM response was visible by Ca(2+) influx which was accompanied by higher phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 and Akt after alpha-IgM stimulation in combination with higher surface expression of IgM, IgD, CD19, CD38 and CD43 compared to the unresponsive cases (n=28). Based on RNA sequencing analysis several components of the canonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway, especially those related to NF-kappaB inhibition, were expressed more highly in unresponsive cases. Moreover, upon alpha-IgM stimulation, the expression of these NF-kappaB pathway genes (especially genes coding for NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors but also NF-kappaB subunit REL) was upregulated in BCR-responsive cases while the level did not change, compared to basal level, in the unresponsive cases. These findings suggest that cells from CLL cases with enhanced NF-kappaB signaling have a lesser capacity to respond to BCR stimulation.",,PMC6939541,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Olaptesed pegol (NOX-A12) is a pegylated structured L-oligoribonucleotide that binds and neutralizes CXCL12, a chemokine tightly regulating the life cycle of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The resulting inhibition of CXCR4 and CXCR7 signaling reduces the protective activity of the bone marrow and lymph node microenvironment. CXCL12 inhibition mobilizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells into the circulation and prevents their homing into the protective niches. In this phase I/II study, 28 patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated with olaptesed pegol in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. Combination treatment was preceded by single escalating pilot doses of olaptesed pegol in the first ten patients for evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetics. Peak concentrations and systemic exposure of olaptesed pegol were dose-linear; plasma elimination was monophasic with a 53.2 h half-life. A rapid increase in circulating chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells was observed already 1 h after administration of olaptesed pegol and lasted for at least 72 h. Single-agent treatment was well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. The combination regimen yielded an overall response rate of 86%, with 11% of patients achieving a complete response and 75% a partial response. Notably, all ten high-risk patients, including four with a 17p deletion, responded to treatment. The median progression-free survival was 15.4 (95% confidence interval: 12.2, 26.2) months while the median overall survival was not reached with >80% of patients alive after a median follow-up of 28 months. Olaptesed pegol was well tolerated and did not result in additional toxicity when combined with bendamustine and rituximab (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01486797). Further clinical development of this novel CXCL12 inhibitor is thus warranted.",,PMC6886437,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01486797'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endothelial cells (ECs) are the building blocks of blood vessels, yet our understanding of EC specification remains incomplete. Zebrafish cloche/npas4l mutants have been used broadly as an avascular model, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of action of the Npas4l transcription factor. Here, to identify its direct and indirect target genes, we have combined complementary genome-wide approaches, including transcriptome analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The cross-analysis of these datasets indicates that Npas4l functions as a master regulator by directly inducing a group of transcription factor genes that are crucial for hematoendothelial specification, such as etv2, tal1 and lmo2 We also identified new targets of Npas4l and investigated the function of a subset of them using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Phenotypic characterization of tspan18b mutants reveals a novel player in developmental angiogenesis, confirming the reliability of the datasets generated.

10.1186/s13045-019-0732-7.,"BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells (CAR-T) have demonstrated extraordinary efficacy in B cell malignancy therapy and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for diffuse large B cell lymphoma and acute B lymphocytic leukemia treatment. However, treatment of T cell malignancies using CAR-T cells remains limited due to the shared antigens between malignant T cells and normal T cells. CD5 is considered one of the important characteristic markers of malignant T cells and is expressed on almost all normal T cells but not on NK-92 cells. Recently, NK-92 cells have been utilized as CAR-modified immune cells. However, in preclinical models, CAR-T cells seem to be superior to CAR-NK-92 cells. Therefore, we speculate that in addition to the short lifespan of NK-92 cells in mice, the costimulatory domain used in CAR constructs might not be suitable for CAR-NK-92 cell engineering. METHODS: Two second-generation anti-CD5 CAR plasmids with different costimulatory domains were constructed, one using the T-cell-associated activating receptor-4-1BB (BB.z) and the other using a NK-cell-associated activating receptor-2B4 (2B4.z). Subsequently, BB.z-NK and 2B4.z-NK were generated. Specific cytotoxicity against CD5(+) malignant cell lines, primary CD5(+) malignant cells, and normal T cells was evaluated in vitro. Moreover, a CD5(+) T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) mouse model was established and used to assess the efficacy of CD5-CAR NK immunotherapy in vivo. RESULTS: Both BB.z-NK and 2B4.z-NK exhibited specific cytotoxicity against CD5(+) malignant cells in vitro and prolonged the survival of T-ALL xenograft mice. Encouragingly, 2B4.z-NK cells displayed greater anti-CD5(+) malignancy capacity than that of BB.z-NK, accompanied by a greater direct lytic side effect versus BB.z-NK.

LSCs are characterized by unrestricted self-renewal and contribute to the malignancy of leukemia. Aberrant protein fucosylation is associated with AML progression. However, it is still less understood that the miR-29b/Sp1/FUT4 crosstalk involved in the fucosylation-mediated LSCs malignancy in AML. METHODS: AML cell lines were sorted by magnetic microbeads to obtain the CD34 + CD38- sub-population. The key biomarkers for LSCs were identified by flow cytometry. Fucosyltransferase genes were screened by qRT-PCR, and FUT4 was focused. Effect of FUT4 on LSCs malignancy was determined by CCK8 assay, sphere formation assay, immunofluorescence staining, apoptosis and in vivo xenografts experiments. The linkage of FUT4 promoter and Sp1 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. ChIP-PCR assay was used to show the directly binding of Sp1 and FUT4 promoter. Activity of Wnt//beta-catenin pathway was determined by western blot. Overall survival curves were diagrammed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Here, the expressional profiles of 11 fucosyltransferase genes were different comparing LSCs and non-LSCs of KG-1a and MOLM13 cells, whereas CD34 + CD38- cells exhibited higher expression of FUT4. Functionally, alteration of FUT4 in CD34 + CD38- cells modulated LSCs malignant behaviors both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D) or translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) prevented LSCs progression, and Sp1 was identified as the efficient regulator of FUT4 transcription. Moreover, miR-29b directly affected the binding of Sp1 and FUT4 promoter region, which further mediated LSCs proliferation, apoptosis and drug-resistance through fucosylated-CD44 via activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Clinically, Sp1 and FUT4 were up-regulated and positively correlated with poor overall survival of AML patients. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that miR-29b/Sp1/FUT4 axis promoted the malignant behaviors of LSCs by regulating fucosylated CD44 via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Identifying LSCs surface markers and targeting LSCs were important for the development of potential therapies in AML.",['81772277/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],PMC6524323,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FUT4', 'LSCs', 'Sp1', 'Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', 'miR-29b']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-3253'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal expression in sialyated N-glycans have been observed in MDR leukemia. However, the role of sialylation regulated MDR remains poorly understood. The aim of this work is to analyze the alternation of N-glycans in T-ALL MDR. METHODS: Here, mass spectrometry (MS) is analyzed to screen the N-glycan profiles from ALL cell line CR and adriamycin (ADR)-resistant CR (CR/A) cells. The expression of sialyltransferase (ST) genes in T-ALL cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of T-ALL patients were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Functionally, T-ALL cell proliferation and MDR are detected through CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, western blot and flow cytometry. RIP assay and Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirm the binding association between ZFAS1 and miR-150. Xenograft nude mice models are used to determine the role of ST6GAL1 in vivo. RESULTS: Elevated expression of alpha2, 6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) has been detected. The altered level of ST6GAL1 was corresponding to the drug-resistant phenotype of T-ALL cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. ZFAS1/miR-150/ST6GAL1 axis was existed in T-ALL cell lines. MiR-150 was downregulated and inversely correlated to ST6GAL1 expression. ZFAS1 was a direct target of miR-150 and positively modulated ST6GAL1 level by binding miR-150. ZFAS1/miR-150/ST6GAL1 axis functioned to regulate ADR-resistant cell growth and apoptosis. Besides, EGFR was demonstrated to be a substrate of ST6GAL1, and the sialylated EGFR had an impact on the PI3K/Akt pathway. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that ZFAS1/miR-150/ST6GAL1 axis involves in the progression of T-ALL/MDR further mediates sialylated EGFR via PI3K/Akt pathway.

Bovine major histocompatibility complex (BoLAs) are used extensively as markers of disease and immunological traits in cattle. For BLV diagnosis, proviral load is a major diagnosis index for the determination of disease progression and transmission risk. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of BoLA-DRB3 alleles, BoLA-DQA1 alleles, and haplotypes of BoLA class II isolated from the heads of 910 BLV-infected cows out of 1290 cows assessed from BLV-positive farms, in a nationwide survey from 2011 to 2014 in Japan. Our aim was to identify BoLA class II polymorphisms associated with the BLV proviral load in the Holstein cow. The study examined 569 cows with a high proviral load and 341 cows with a low proviral load. Using the highest odds ratio (OR) as a comparison index, we confirmed that BoLA-DRB3 was the best marker for determining which cow spread the BLV (OR 13.9 for BoLA-DRB3, OR 11.5 for BoLA-DQA1, and OR 6.2 for BoLA class II haplotype). In addition, DRB3*002:01, *009:02, *012:01, *014:01, and *015:01 were determined as BLV provirus associated alleles. BoLA-DRB3*002:01, *009:02, and *014:01 were determined as resistant alleles (OR > 1), and BoLA-DRB3*012:01 and *015:01 were determined as susceptible alleles (OR < 1). In this study, we showed that BoLA-DRB3 was a good marker for determining which cow spread BLV, and we found not only one resistant allele (BoLA-DRB3*009:02), but also two other disease-resistant alleles and two disease-susceptible alleles. This designation of major alleles as markers of susceptibility or resistance can allow the determination of the susceptibility or resistance of most cows to disease. Overall, the results of this study may be useful in eliminating BLV from farms without having to separate cows into several cowsheds.","['16H02590/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '16K08039/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP)/International', '16817983/Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution/International', '16930548/Special Scheme Project on Vitalizing Management Entities of Agriculture,', 'Forestry and Fisheries/International']",PMC6524304,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BoLA-DQA1', '*BoLA-DRB3', '*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Japanese Holstein', '*Proviral load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the chronic stage of BLV infection the immune response limits viral replication and the mitotic division of latently infected cells, carrying BLV provirus, allows viral expansion and disease progression towards a lymphoproliferative disorder. Several stressor factors have been associated with animal production and handling. As natural mediator of stress, glucocorticoids are strong immunosuppressive agents; moreover, they can bind long-terminal repeat region of retroviruses and induce viral expression. In the present study, we present a case report describing the spontaneous reactivation of BLV infection in naturally infected cattle. CASE PRESENTATION: In order to investigate if virus reactivation occurred in vivo during the course of BLV infection, we followed up for 328 days one Holstein cow (> 3 years) chronically infected with BLV which presented high-proviral loads. This animal was neither lactating nor pregnant. Furthermore, we investigated if a stressor stimulus, in this case the administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), could impact the course of BLV infection in three additional cattle. For the first time, we observed a high level of BLV transcripts in a total of four cattle chronically infected with BLV. The detection of viral transcripts corresponding to pol gene strongly suggests virus reactivation in these animals. Interestingly, this simultaneous virus reactivation was unrelated to dexamethasone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We reported for the first time spontaneous and high level of BLV transcriptional activation in cattle chronically infected with BLV. Although virus reactivation was unrelated to dexamethasone treatment, other stressor stimuli might have influenced this outcome. Future studies will be necessary to understand these observations, since the spontaneous virus reactivation presented here might have implications on BLV pathogenesis and transmission.",,PMC6524309,,['NOTNLM'],"['BLV', 'Retrovirus', 'Stress', 'Transcriptional activation']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1311-060X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 16.,"Fisetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, is found in common fruits and vegetables and has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects in many human cancer cell lines. No information has shown that fisetin induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in mouse leukemia WEHI-3 cells. We found that fisetin decreased total viable cells through G0/G1 phase arrest and induced sub-G1 phase (apoptosis). We have confirmed fisetin induced cell apoptosis by the formation of DNA fragmentation and induction of apoptotic cell death. Results indicated that fisetin induced intracellular Ca 2+ increase but decreased the ROS production and the levels of DeltaPsi m in WEHI-3 cells. Fisetin increased the activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9 and then treated with fisetin and results showed increased viable cell number when compared to fisetin treated only. Fisetin reduced expressions of cdc25a but increased p-p53, Chk1, p21 and p27 that may lead to G0/G1 phase arrest. Fisetin inhibited anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Bak. Furthermore, fisetin increased the protein expression of cytochrome c and AIF. Fisetin decreased cell number through G0/G1 phase arrest via the inhibition of cdc25c and induction of apoptosis through caspase-dependent and mitochondria-dependent pathways. Therefore, fisetin may be useful as a potential therapeutic agent for leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Fisetin', 'G/G Phase Arrest', 'Leukemia', 'WEHI-3 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acylation of diethyl methylphosphonate with selected ethyl salicylates furnished 3-diethoxyphosphorylchromen-4-ones which were next used as Michael acceptors in the reaction with various Grignard reagents. The adducts were obtained as the mixtures of trans and cis diastereoisomers along with a small amount of enol forms. Their relative configuration and preferred conformation were established by NMR analysis. The adducts turned up to be effective Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagents giving 2-substituted 3-methylidenechroman-4-ones, which were then tested for their possible cytotoxic activity against two leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and NALM-6, and against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. All new compounds (14a-o) were highly cytotoxic for the leukemic cells and showed a moderate or weak effect on MCF-7 cells. Analog 14d exhibited the highest growth inhibitory activity and was more potent than carboplatin against HL-60 (IC50 = 1.46 +/- 0.16 microM) and NALM-6 (IC50 = 0.50 +/- 0.05 microM) cells. Further tests showed that 14d induced apoptosis in NALM-6 cells, which was mediated mostly through the extrinsic pathway.","['DEC-2012/07/B/ST5/02006/Narodowe Centrum Nauki', 'No. 503/1-156-02/503-11-02./Medical University of Lodz']",PMC6572547,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-methylidenechroman-4-ones', 'Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination', 'Michael addition', 'apoptosis', 'cancer cell lines']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4898-1405'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

common type of childhood cancer worldwide. Mexico City has one of the highest incidences and mortality rates of this cancer. It has previously been recognized that chromosomal translocations are important in cancer etiology. Specific fusion genes have been considered as important treatment targets in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present research aimed at the identification and characterization of novel fusion genes with potential clinical implications in Mexican children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The RNA-sequencing approach was used. Four fusion genes not previously reported were identified: CREBBP-SRGAP2B, DNAH14-IKZF1, ETV6-SNUPN, ETV6-NUFIP1. Although a fusion gene is not sufficient to cause leukemia, it could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Notably, these new translocations were found in genes encoding for hematopoietic transcription factors which are known to play an important role in leukemogenesis and disease prognosis such as IKZF1, CREBBP, and ETV6. In addition, they may have an impact on the prognosis of Mexican pediatric patients with ALL, with the potential to be included in the current risk stratification schemes or used as therapeutic targets.","['SALUD-2010-1-141026, FIS/IMSS/PROT/895/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'PDCPN2013-01-215726, FIS/IMSS/PROT/1364/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'SALUD 2015-1-262190, FIS/IMSS/PROT/1533/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'CB-2015-1-258042, FIS/IMSS/PROT/1548/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'FONCICYT/37/2018, FIS/IMSS/PROT1782/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/PRIO/11/017/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/G12/1134/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/PRIO/14/031/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/MD13/1254/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/PRIO/15/048/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', ', FIS/IMSS/PROT/MD15/1504/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/G15/1477/Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social']",PMC6566803,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA sequencing', 'chromosomal translocation', 'fusion gene', 'genetic variations', 'leukemogenesis', 'risk stratification']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0949-461X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7040-9379', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8070-9727', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2152-3954', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6590-9712']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A BCR-ABL1 transcript level on the International Scale (BCR-ABL1IS) of </=10% at the initiation of -dasatinib treatment was found to be associated with a higher probability of achieving MMR. Among patients with a -BCR-ABL1IS higher than 10% at initiation of dasatinib treatment, dasatinib showed better performance as a second-line therapy than as a third-line therapy. The patients who achieved an optimal molecular response at 3 months had a superior cumulative incidence of MMR and CCyR compared with patients who failed to achieve such a response.

Epub 2019 Apr 29.,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), demethylase against mono- and di - methylated histone3 lysine 4, has emerged as a promising target in oncology. More specifically, it has been demonstrated as a key promoter in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and several LSD1 inhibitors have already entered into clinical trials for the treatment of AML. In this paper, a series of new indole derivatives were designed and synthesized based on a lead compound obtained by a high-throughput screening with our in-house compound library. Among the synthetic compounds, 9e was characterized as a potent LSD1 inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.230muM and can inhibit the proliferation of THP-1cells effectively. And most importantly, this is the first irreversible LSD1 inhibitor that is not derived from monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hence, the discovery of 9e may serve as a proof of concept work for AML treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Indole', 'Inhibitor', 'Irreversible', 'LSD1', 'Lactone']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Compounds 5/6, 8a-d, 8f, 9a-d, and 9f were screened by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) at 10muM against sixty different human cancer cell lines (one-dose trial). Chalcones 8b and 9b satisfied the pre-determined threshold inhibition criteria and were selected for screening at five different concentrations (100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01muM). Compound 8b exhibited remarkable GI50 values ranging from 0.57 to 12.4muM, with cytotoxic effects being observed in almost all cases, especially against the cell lines K-562 of Leukemia and LOX IMVI of Melanoma with GI50=0.57 and 1.28muM, respectively. Moreover, all compounds were screened against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, chalcones 8a-c and 9a-c were the most active showing MIC values between 14 and 42muM, and interestingly they were devoid of antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus.

There are many reported differences in large scale SVs between HL-60 and HL-60/S4, two cell lines derived from the same acute myeloid leukemia sample. However, the stability and variability of inter- and intra-chromosomal structural variants between different sources of the same cell line is unknown. Here, we used Hi-C and RNA-seq to identify and compare large SVs in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines. Comparisons with previously published karyotypes identified novel SVs in both cell lines. Hi-C was used to characterize the known expansion centered on the MYC locus. The MYC expansion was integrated into known locations in HL-60/S4, and a novel location (chr4) in HL-60. The HL-60 cell line has more within-line structural variation than the HL-60/S4 derivative cell line. Collectively we demonstrate the usefulness of Hi-C and with RNA-seq data for the identification and characterization of SVs.",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Severe infections (SI) significantly impact on non-relapse mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We assessed 432 children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after total body irradiation based myeloablative HSCT within the multicenter ALL-BFM-SCT 2003 trial for SI grade 3 or higher according to common terminology criteria for adverse events. A total 172 patients experienced at least one SI. Transplantation from matched unrelated donors (MUD) was associated with any type of SI in the pre-engraftment period (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.57; P < .001), and with any SI between day +30 and + 100 (HR: 2.91; P = .011). Bacterial (HR: 2.24; P = .041) and fungal infections (HR: 4.06; P = .057) occurred more often in the pre-engraftment phase and viral infections more often before day +30 (HR: 2.66; P = .007) or between day +30 and + 100 (HR: 3.89; P = .002) after HSCT from MUD as compared to matched sibling donors. Chronic GvHD was an independent risk factor for any type of SI after day +100 (HR: 2.57; P < .002). We conclude that allogeneic HSCT from MUD in children and adolescents with pediatric ALL is associated with higher infection rates, which seems attributable to an intensified GvHD prophylaxis including serotherapy and methotrexate.",,PMC6772138,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5107-5123'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient received previous chemotherapy for mantle cell lymphoma localized to the large bowel and had been in complete remission for 3 years. The diagnosis of EMH was achieved after a deep incisional biopsy of a nodule from the thigh, and with pathological examination that included immunohistochemical studies. After a follow-up of 14 months, the patient developed an acute myeloid leukemia, classified as therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematological malignancies.

Historically, prognostic markers and therapeutic paradigms have been applied from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Interest has increased recently in developing tailored approaches for the MDS/MPN overlap syndrome of CMML. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple prognostic scores have been validated specifically for CMML in the past 5 years. These incorporate somatic mutations, with ASXL1 mutations repeatedly correlating with poor prognosis. Accurate prognostication can guide treatment. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and curative allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) remain the most available standard treatments. Recently, a number of novel approaches using unapproved therapies (i.e., lenalidomide, ruxolitinib, sotatercept, and tipifarnib) have demonstrated some efficacy in CMML. Increased recognition and interest in CMML have led to the development of a number of new prognostic models and potential treatment options. Standard treatment options remain limited and clinical trials should be strongly considered whenever available.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASXL1', '*Allogeneic BMT', '*CPSS', '*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*Mayo prognostic model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 15.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid malignancies characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia and dishematopoiesis and frequently progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Genetic defects play a major role in pathogenesis of MDS, including cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations, and abnormal gene expression. Chromosomal abnormalities have been detected in approximately 50-60% of MDS patients, including the deletions of chromosome 5q and 7q, trisomy 8, and complex karyotypes. Newer genomic technologies, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism array and next-generation sequencing, revealed the heterozygous deletions resulting in haploinsufficient gene expression (e.g., CSNK1A1, DDX41 on chromosome 5, CUX1, LUC7L2, EZH2 on chromosome 7) involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. In addition, recurrent somatic mutations in more than 50 genes have been identified in 80-90% of MDS. The most recurrent genetic mutations are involved in the RNA splicing (e.g., SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, LUC7L2, DDX41) and epigenetic modifications, such as histone modification (e.g., ASXL1, EZH2) and DNA methylation (e.g., TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/IDH2).

We performed a retrospective analysis of 100 patients with previously untreated PMF, receiving frontline treatment with single agent ruxolitinib, and compared them to 105 patients, receiving frontline treatment with a non-ruxolitinib-based therapy, matched by age, sex, DIPSS plus, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Use of ruxolitinib associated with a significantly higher rate of renal improvement (RI) > 10% (73% vs 50%, p = 0.01) confirmed on multivariate analysis (MVA) [odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-5.5, p < 0.001]. After a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 1-159 months), median failure-free survival (FFS) was 14 months (range, 1-117 months). Achievement of a RI > 10% maintained its independent association with prolonged FFS on MVA (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2, p = 0.02).

Epub 2019 May 15.,"Genetic and epigenetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity cooperate to shape the evolutionary course of cancer(1). Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic diversification and evolution after therapy(2,3). The CLL epigenome is also an important disease-defining feature(4,5), and growing populations of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA methylation known as epimutations(6). However, previous studies using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation rate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed that the common clonal origin of CLL results in a consistently increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages across the trajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this directly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant transformation and a greater proliferative history. Integration of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of epimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node after treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles. The single-cell integration of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional information thus charts the lineage history of CLL and its evolution with therapy.","['R01 CA216273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 ES025431/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA206978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL145283/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA229902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 CA239065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6533116,['NIHMS1527005'],,,,,,,,,,['Nat Rev Genet. 2019 Aug;20(8):434-435.

With this new era of personalized cancer immunotherapy, multiple challenges are present ranging from implementation of a CAR-T program to safe delivery of the drug, long-term toxicity monitoring and disease assessments. To address these issues, experts representing the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (ASBMT), the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the International Society of Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT), and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), formed a global CAR-T task force to identify and address key questions pertinent for hematologists and transplant physicians regarding the clinical use of anti CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with B-ALL. This article presents an initial roadmap for navigating common clinical practice scenarios that will become more prevalent now that the first commercially available CAR-T product for B-ALL has been approved.","['ZIA BC011743/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011927/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8268756,['NIHMS1707358'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3755-4889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9325-432X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7665-7100', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1411-8942']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2019 Mar;25(3):e76-e85.

Epub 2019 May 15.,"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) is a diagnosis of exclusion, being the most common entity in mature T-cell neoplasms, and its molecular pathogenesis remains significantly understudied. Here, combining whole-exome and targeted-capture sequencing, gene-expression profiling, and immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples from 133 cases, we have delineated the entire landscape of somatic alterations, and discovered frequently affected driver pathways in PTCL, NOS, with and without a T-follicular helper (TFH) cell phenotype. In addition to previously reported mutational targets, we identified a number of novel recurrently altered genes, such as KMT2C, SETD1B, YTHDF2, and PDCD1. We integrated these genetic drivers using hierarchical clustering and identified a previously undescribed molecular subtype characterized by TP53 and/or CDKN2A mutations and deletions in non-TFH PTCL, NOS. This subtype exhibited different prognosis and unique genetic features associated with extensive chromosomal instability, which preferentially affected molecules involved in immune escape and transcriptional regulation, such as HLA-A/B and IKZF2. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of PTCL, NOS by highlighting their genetic heterogeneity. These results should help to devise a novel molecular classification of PTCLs and to exploit a new therapeutic strategy for this group of aggressive malignancies.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2356-3725', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1158-5131', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4283-2983', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4612-2778', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5983-8578', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0472-6680', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1599-5800']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study, patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM were enrolled to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-myeloma activity of PIM447. PIM447 was administered in escalating oral doses of 70-700 mg once daily (q.d.) for 28-day continuous cycles. Seventy-nine patients with a median of four prior therapies were enrolled. Seventy-seven patients (97.5%) had an adverse event (AE) suspected as treatment related, with treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs being mostly hematologic. Eleven dose-limiting toxicities occurred, and an MTD of 500 mg q.d. and an RD of 300 mg q.d. were established. The main reason for discontinuation was disease progression in 54 patients (68.4%). In the entire study population, a disease control rate of 72.2%, a clinical benefit rate of 25.3%, and an overall response rate of 8.9% were observed per modified International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Median progression-free survival at the RD was 10.9 months. PIM447 was well tolerated and demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in relapsed/refractory MM patients, providing proof of principle for Pim (Proviral Insertions of Moloney Murine leukemia virus) kinase inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach in MM.",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5392-9284'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is found at elevated levels in certain malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia and glioma. It is produced by a mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1/2, a low-affinity/high-capacity enzyme. Its degradation, in contrast, is catalysed by the high-affinity/low-capacity enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HDH). So far, it has not been proven experimentally that the accumulation of D-2-HG in IDH mutant cells is the result of its insufficient degradation by D2HDH. Therefore, we developed an LC-MS/MS-based enzyme activity assay that measures the temporal drop in substrate and compared this to the expression of D2HDH protein as measured by Western blot. Our data clearly indicate, that the maximum D-2-HG degradation rate by D2HDH is reached in vivo, as vmax is low in comparison to production of D-2-HG by mutant IDH1/2. The latter seems to be limited only by substrate availability. Further, incubation of IDH wild type cells for up to 48 hours with 5 mM D-2-HG did not result in a significant increase in either D2HDH protein abundance or enzyme activity.",,PMC6520482,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5783-3279', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7337-2380']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present report, 103 SLL patients were analyzed from both, clinical trials of the German Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Study Group and Greek centers, and emphasis was placed on the therapeutic strategy. The impact of lymph node characteristics, such as the presence of proliferation centers (PCs) on response and survival was also assessed. RESULTS: SLL patients included in clinical trials were treated mostly with fludarabine-based regimens while those in ""real-life"" were staged and treated mostly as patients with low-grade lymphomas. Our analysis showed a trend for better survival for patients with SLL without detectable PCs. CONCLUSION: Patients with SLL outside of clinical trials are usually treated as cases of lymphoma. In addition, this analysis supports published data regarding the adverse prognostic value of the presence of PCs in lymphoid nodes in SLL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'proliferation centers', 'treatment']",,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Mar 16.,"Secondary AML (sAML), referring to AML arising after prior cytotoxic/radiation/immunosuppressive therapy (tAML) or an antecedent hematologic disorder, now primarily classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC), accounts for 10%-30% of AML cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. sAML has historically been treated with intensive chemotherapy (eg, 7 + 3) or less aggressive regimens (eg, low-dose cytarabine or azacytidine for older/unfit patients); however, outcomes are typically poor, especially for older adults. Recently, CPX-351, a liposomal co-encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin at a synergistic ratio, demonstrated improved front-line outcomes in older patients with high-risk/sAML. CPX-351 has been approved for adults with newly diagnosed tAML or AML-MRC and has an NCCN category 1 recommendation for induction therapy of patients aged >60 years with high-risk/sAML. Other novel therapies may also benefit certain sAML subgroups. Greater clarity around the optimal diagnosis and treatment of sAML patients is needed to improve outcomes in this high-risk subpopulation.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-MRC', 'Diagnosis', 'Secondary AML', 'Therapy', 'Therapy-related AML']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Apr 15.,"Pediatric non-Down-syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS-AMKL) is a heterogeneous subtype of leukemia that has historically been associated with poor prognosis. Until the advent of large-scale genomic sequencing, the management of patients with non-DS-AMKL was very difficult due to the absence of reliable biological prognostic markers. The sequencing of large cohort of pediatric non-DS-AMKL samples led to the discovery of novel genetic aberrations, including high-frequency fusions, such as CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-KDM5 A, as well as less frequent aberrations, such as HOX rearrangements. These new insights into the genetic landscape of pediatric non-DS-AMKL has allowed refining the risk-group stratification, leading to important changes in the prognostic scenario of these patients. This review summarizes the most important molecular pathogenic mechanisms of pediatric non-DS-AMKL. A critical discussion on how novel genetic abnormalities have refined the risk profile assessment and changed the management of these patients in clinical practice is also provided.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AMKL', 'Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia', 'FAB M7']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The progresses made in understanding its biology led to the development of targeted therapies. In this review, we summarize the current and future approaches in management of adult ALL. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface antigens (CD19, CD20, and CD22), bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy are breakthrough treatments. They resulted in FDA approvals of blinatumomab in 2014, inotuzumab ozagamicin in 2017, and tisagenlecleucel in 2017 for relapsed/refractory ALL. Currently, long-term survival is achieved in more than 50% of patients with precursor B-ALL (50-70% in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL), 50-60% T-ALL, and 80% mature B-ALL. Ongoing efforts exist to optimize therapeutic options in both the relapsed/refractory as well as the frontline settings.

One such nutritional supplement, Ocoxin Oral solution (OOS), is a composite formulation that contains several antioxidants and exhibits antitumoral properties in several in vitro and in vivo tumor conditions. Here, we performed a functional genomic analysis to uncover the mechanism of the antitumoral action of OOS. Using in vivo models of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, HEL cells, representative of a liquid tumor) and small-cell lung cancer (GLC-8, representative of a solid tumor), we showed that OOS treatment altered the transcriptome of xenografted tumors created by subcutaneously implanting these cells. Functional transcriptomic studies pointed to a cell cycle deregulation after OOS treatment. The main pathway responsible for this deregulation was the E2F-TFDP route, which was affected at different points. The alterations ultimately led to a decrease in pathway activation. Moreover, when OOS-deregulated genes in the AML context were analyzed in patient samples, a clear correlation with their levels and prognosis was observed. Together, these data led us to suggest that the antitumoral effect of OOS is due to blockade of cell cycle progression mainly caused by the action of OOS on the E2F-TFDP pathway.","['BFU2012-39151 and BFU2015-71371-R/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y', 'Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana', 'CT-001/Catalysis']",PMC6566638,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antioxidants', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'p27', 'small-cell lung cancer']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5405-5494'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 12.,"Masquerade syndromes represent a large set of ophthalmological entities that mimic inflammatory conditions. Any delay in their diagnosis may be correlated with systemic dissemination or worsening of the causal disease and, therefore, with poor prognosis. One of the disadvantages of the new potent treatments of uveitis is the delay that they can induce in the diagnosis of neoplastic intraocular infiltrations. Thorough and careful clinical examination of all patients referred for uveitis, especially when they are Caucasian, over 50 years of age, and with posterior segment involvement, is of paramount importance in this context. Ancillary investigations and often-invasive histo-pathologic evaluation of tissue specimens or ocular fluids are regularly required in these situations. The most common masquerade syndrome is primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL). New molecular diagnostic tools may be helpful in challenging cases lacking cytological confirmation. Therapeutic strategies targeting tumoral cells in the eye and also in the central nervous system can improve the life expectancy of affected patients.

Here, we show that this activity is shared by GBP2, but not by other members of the human GBP family. GBP2/5 decrease the activity of the cellular proprotein convertase furin, which mediates conversion of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) precursor gp160 into mature gp120 and gp41. Because this process primes HIV-1 Env for membrane fusion, viral particles produced in the presence of GBP2/5 are poorly infectious due to increased incorporation of non-functional gp160. Furin activity is critical for the processing of envelope glycoproteins of many viral pathogens. Consistently, GBP2/5 also inhibit Zika, measles, and influenza A virus replication and decrease infectivity of viral particles carrying glycoproteins of Marburg and murine leukemia viruses. Collectively, our results show that GPB2/5 exert broad antiviral activity by suppressing the activity of the virus-dependency factor furin.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GBPs', '*HIV', '*Zika virus', '*furin', '*influenza A virus', '*measles virus', '*restriction factor', '*viral envelope proteins']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

However, direct evidence of the fitness of CHIP-mutated human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in blood reconstitution is lacking. Because myeloablative treatment and transplantation enforce stress on HSCs, we followed 81 patients with solid tumors or lymphoid diseases undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for the development of CHIP. We found a high incidence of CHIP (22%) after ASCT with a high mean variant allele frequency (VAF) of 10.7%. Most mutations were already present in the graft, albeit at lower VAFs, demonstrating a selective reconstitution advantage of mutated HSCs after ASCT. However, patients with CHIP mutations in DNA-damage response genes showed delayed neutrophil reconstitution. Thus, CHIP-mutated stem and progenitor cells largely gain on clone size upon ASCT-related blood reconstitution, leading to an increased future risk of CHIP-associated complications.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASCT', '*CHIP', '*autologous stem cell transplantation', '*chemotherapy', '*clonal dominance', '*clonal hematopoiesis', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*hematopoietic stress', '*leukemia', '*somatic mutations']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Patients live at home but appear at the hospital every second day for follow-up visits. Patients must adhere to specific precautions due to an impaired immune system, which challenges and influence the life of the whole family. This qualitative study, based on individual and group interviews with spouses to AL patients in curative intended treatment, elucidates how the intense and substantial caregiver role affects the everyday lives of spouses to AL patients in curative intended treatment. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured group interviews (n = 6) and individual interviews (n = 5) with spouses to AL patients were conducted at different time points during the whole course of treatment. Theories of everyday life served as the theoretical framework. RESULTS: The spouses described their life as a constant state of vigilance and attention as a consequence of the responsibility they felt arising from the treatment in the outpatient setting. These made them experience their role as a burden. The social life of the spouses and the families suffered substantially due to the precautions that were instated in the home. However, many experienced that relations in the family were developed positively. CONCLUSIONS: Close relatives experience additional psychosocial burdens instigated by the outpatient management regimens. This is important knowledge for the health care system to include in future development of AL outpatient settings, to prioritize and support offers to the relatives that recognize their sense of burden. This could apply not only to relatives of AL patients but to the relatives of other severely ill patients as well.",,PMC6519813,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2263-8024', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6914-2697']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCH has been associated with multiple causes including drugs (6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), toxins, viruses and autoimmune. GCH has been described in few patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here we describe three patients diagnosed with GCH thought to be related to underlying CLL and its management. All of our patients were treated with a combination of immunosuppression as well as CLL-directed therapy to address CLL and concomitant liver disease. GCH is a rare manifestation of active CLL and should be ruled out with prompt liver biopsy in patients with CLL with persistent transaminitis without another attributable cause. Prompt treatment of GCH with immunosuppression is required to prevent long-term liver toxicity. If transaminitis does not improve with immunosuppression alone, the addition of CLL directed therapy should be considered in patients who carry this diagnosis to prevent long-term liver toxicity.",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6628867,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*autoimmune hepatitis', '*giant cell hepatitis', '*ibrutinib', '*transaminitis']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5068-9040'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The product of this fusion gene, p210, a protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has significantly reduced the annual mortality rate among patients with CML. Although most of these patients respond to first-line TKI therapy, the use of TKIs is complicated by the development of resistance or intolerance in some patients, resulting in a loss of response or discontinuation of treatment. Inadequate response to TKI therapy is associated with poor long-term outcome, and the cases of patients with resistance or intolerance should be carefully evaluated for alternative treatment options. This report discusses the challenges associated with the management of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML in a patient with intolerance to multiple TKI therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 15.,"BACKGROUND: Strategies using oral arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) are efficacious in relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but they have not been examined in newly diagnosed cases. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients (24 men and 38 women) with a median age of 52 years (range, 22-85 years), 36% of whom had high-risk features, underwent induction with all-trans retinoic acid at 45 mg/m(2) /d, oral As2 O3 at 10 mg/d, and ascorbic acid at 1 g/d (the all-trans retinoic acid-arsenic trioxide-ascorbic acid [AAA] regimen) for 6 weeks (with patients younger than 70 years additionally receiving daunorubicin at 50 mg/m(2) /d x 3); they then underwent consolidation with 2 monthly cycles of daunorubicin (50 mg/m(2) /d x 2) and cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) /d x 5) and received AAA maintenance (2 weeks every 8 weeks) for 2 years. A contemporaneous cohort of 37 newly diagnosed patients (15 men and 22 women) with a median age of 51 years (range, 23-78 years), not consenting to oral As2 O3 induction but receiving similar induction, consolidation, and AAA maintenance, served as a comparator group; 46% of these patients had high-risk features. RESULTS: The oral As2 O3 induction cohort showed a complete remission (CR) rate of 100%. After a median of 37 months (range, 13-82 months), there were no relapses, so conventional risks (age, leukocyte and platelet counts, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3] mutations) were not relevant. The leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 100% at 3 years and 94.1% at 5 years. The non-As2 O3 induction cohort showed a CR rate of 100%. After a median of 52 months (range, 14-77 months), there were 3 relapses (8%). Comparable patients in the oral As2 O3 induction and non-As2 O3 induction cohorts showed similar OS, but LFS was significantly superior in the oral As2 O3 induction cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of oral As2 O3 into induction for newly diagnosed APL was safe and decreased relapses.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*induction', '*leukemia-free survival', '*maintenance', '*newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*oral arsenic trioxide']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8156-6978'],['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not all patients benefit from these therapies, presumably due to pretreatment regimens. Therefore, we determined the effect of different treatment lines on the activity of T cells and their responsiveness to AFM11. AFM11 is a tetravalent, bispecific CD19/CD3 immunoengager based on Affimed's ROCK platform, currently being investigated in phase I clinical trials for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T cells from B-cell lymphoma patients treated with either rituximab+bendamustine (R-Benda), rituximab+CHOP (R-CHOP), or with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (HD-BEAM) and autologous HSCT were compared with T cells from healthy donors. Overall, in these patients, T-cell numbers were significantly reduced. To determine whether distinct chemotherapy affects AFM11 efficacy, functional T-cell assays were performed. It is interesting to note that, only in assays that combine target cell lysis, cytokine production and proliferation over 4 days at an effector to target ratio of up to 1:25 significant differences could be detected between the different treatment groups: T cells after R-CHOP showed only modest decrease in their functionality when compared with healthy controls, whereas R-Benda and HD-BEAM had a profound effect on AFM11-induced T-cell cytotoxicity. In conclusion, T cells from lymphoma patients are reduced in number and have functional defects following treatment with certain chemotherapy regimens, also reducing AFM11 efficacy. Importantly, AFM11 was still able to trigger B-cell-directed T-cell immunity in all treatment groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia-derived dendritic cell (DCleu/DC) generated from myeloid blasts improve antileukemic T-cell reactivity and install T-cell memory. Interferon (IFN)alpha-DC methods produce DCleu from chronic myeloid leukemia-patients (pts') blood. Various INFalpha-containing versus other DC methods were studied to produce DCleu (evaluated by flowcytometry) from AML-pts' blast-containing mononuclear (MNC) or whole blood (WB). After DCleu/DC stimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures, T cells' potential to gain antileukemic cytotoxicity was studied and correlated with different DC methods and DCleu/DC counts. (1) Generation of DCleu/DC: (a) ""IFN-GIT"" [containing granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)+IFNalpha+ tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] produced DC successfully (>/=10% DC, >/=5% DCleu/cells) from AML-MNC (WB) in 54 (56%), ""MCM-Mimic"" in 76 (75%), ""Picibanil"" in 83 (64%), and ""Calcium-ionophore"" in 42 (67%) of cases. Proportions of DC subtypes in MNC (WB) were comparable with all DC methods, (b) IFNalpha combinations containing only GM-CSF+IFNalpha or only IFNalpha showed low efficiency to produce DCleu/DC from MNC (WB) compared with ""IFN-GIT."" (2) Antileukemic functionality: DCleu/DC-stimulated T cells showed improved leukemia cytotoxicity compared with blast cells or unstimulated T cells. The highest blast proliferation (=insufficient T cells) was seen with ""IFN-GIT"" DC-stimulated T cells. Probability to respond to immunotherapy or to obtain blast lysis of DC-stimulated T cells correlated with high proportions of DCleu/DC after DC culture, independent of DC-generating methods. (3) Cytokine release profiles: levels of interleukin-6, IFN-gamma, and interleukin-2 were significantly lower in DC culture supernatants (from MNC/WB) with ""IFN-GIT"" compared with ""MCM,"" ""Pici,"" and ""Ca"" DC supernatants. Our data show that (1) WB culture simulates AML-pts' in vivo situation, (2) DC generation is possible from AML-MNC (WB) with IFNalpha-containing and other DC methods, (3) successful IFNalpha-DC generation needs GM-CSF+IFNalpha+TNF-alpha (IFN-GIT); however, ""IFN-GIT"" produces less DCleu/DC compared with other (non-IFNalpha) DC methods, (4) T cells stimulated with ""IFN-GIT""-produced DCleu/DC yielded comparable antileukemic cytotoxicity; however, in cases without achieved blast lysis, an increased blast proliferation was observed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Procoagulant microparticles in the circulation may cause thromboembolic events. The aim of our study was to determine the levels of apoptotic, platelet-derived, endothelial-derived, and tissue factor-positive microparticles of children with ALL at diagnosis and during induction therapy. METHODS: Sixteen precursor B-cell ALL cases and 30 healthy children between 1 and 18 years of age were included. Microparticle levels were analyzed from peripheral blood samples at initial diagnosis, on days 12 and 13 (before and after the first L-asparaginase administration), and on day 33 of ALL-BFM 2000 treatment protocol. Microparticle levels were analyzed by using flow cytometry. RESULTS: At initial diagnosis, platelet, endothelial-derived, and tissue factor-positive microparticle levels were significantly high in children with ALL. They increased significantly after prednisone and L-asparaginase administration. Apoptotic microparticle levels were not elevated at diagnosis, but remained high during all induction therapy period. None of the patients had evidence of thromboembolism during induction therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that children with ALL have increased levels of apoptotic, platelet-derived, endothelial-derived, and tissue factor-positive microprticles during induction therapy. Further studies are needed in larger groups of patients in order to evaluate the risk of elevated microprticles for development of thromboembolism during induction therapy period in children with ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was designed as a two-armed blinded placebo-controlled trial where 0.8 mg/kg (bodyweight) of ketamine mixed in juice was given 30 minutes before the procedure to Group K (ketamine) compared with placebo, only juice, to Group P (placebo). In addition, topical analgesia (EMLA((R))) was given according to established standard of care. Patients and caregivers assessed the pain using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. Results: A total number of 52 patients, equally distributed between Group K and Group P, were included in the study. The placebo-controlled group had significantly higher self-reported pain score than the group receiving ketamine (p = 0.046), as well as in caregiver-assessed pain (p = 0.033). Only three incidents of mild adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: Low-dose oral ketamine can be safely administered for procedural analgesia in pediatric cancer patients undergoing LP in a resource-limited hospital setting and have significant pain-reducing effect compared with placebo.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*low-dose oral ketamine', '*pediatric cancer', '*procedural analgesia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"Hydroxyurea (HU) is a nonalkylating antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of hematological malignancies. HU is a DNA replication stress inducer, and as such, it may induce a premature senescence-like cell phenotype; however, its repercussion on bystander cell proliferation has not been revealed so far. Our results indicate that HU strongly inhibited peripheral blood mesenchymal stromal cells (PBMSC) proliferation by cell cycle arrest in S phase, and that, consequently, PBMSC acquire senescence-related phenotypical changes. HU-treated PBMSC display increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase levels and p16(INK4) expression, as well as DNA damage response and genotoxic effects, evidenced by expression of gammaH2A.X and micronuclei. Moreover, HU-induced PBMSC senescence is mediated by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, as demonstrated by the inhibition of senescence markers in the presence of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin. To determine the HU-induced bystander effect, we used the JAK2V617F-positive human erythroleukemia 92.1.7 (HEL) cells. Co-culture with HU-induced senescent PBMSC (HU-S-PBMSC) strongly inhibited bystander HEL cell proliferation, and this effect is mediated by both ROS and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression. Besides induction of premature senescence, HU educates PBMSC toward an inhibitory phenotype of HEL cell proliferation. Finally, our study contributes to the understanding of the role of HU-induced PBMSC senescence as a potential adjuvant in hematological malignancy therapies.","['175024/Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological', 'Development/International', 'OI175053/Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological', 'Development/International', 'IZ73Z0 152420/1/SNSF_/Swiss National Science Foundation/Switzerland']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*bystander effects', '*hydroxyurea', '*peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells', '*proliferation', '*reactive oxygen species', '*senescence']",,['(c) 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these aberrant epigenetic modifiers, the function of histone methyltransferase KMT2A in somatic tumors is not well known. By analyzing KMT2A expression in patient tissues, we demonstrated that KMT2A was overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues in comparison with adjacent normal tissues and its expression was positively correlated with cancer stages. In KMT2A-knockdown HCT116 and DLD1 cells, cell invasion and migration were consequently suppressed. In addition, KMT2A depletion effectively suppressed cancer metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, cathepsin Z (CTSZ) was demonstrated to be an important downstream gene of KMT2A. Further studies showed that p65 could recruit KMT2A on the promoter region of the downstream gene CTSZ and knockdown of p65 could reduce the KMT2A on the promoter of CTSZ. Finally, our present study revealed that KMT2A epigenetically promotes cancer progression by targeting CTSZ, which has specific functions in cancer invasion and metastasis.",,PMC6601586,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTSZ', '*KMT2A', '*cancer development', '*epigenetic modifier']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6912-7155'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The altered expression of microRNAs in a number of cancers suggests their contribution to disease pathogenesis, where processing pathways may be involved in disease pathogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated changes in the profile of two main components of microRNA biogenesis, AGO2 and DICER, and assessed their correlation with disease progression in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). To achieve this aim, 25 patients afflicted with ALL were included in the study along with 25 healthy subjects as control. The expression level of AGO2 and DICER was evaluated by real-time PCR. The results revealed an increase in the expression of DICER and a decrease in AGO2 in patients. The correlation between the alteration levels of these genes with pathologic events was also studied. This increase or decrease proved to be directly correlated with the progression of the disease particularly in L1 to L2. According to the obtained results, it can be deduced that dysregulation in transcription of DICER and AGO2, involved in the formation of mature microRNAs in cytoplasm of ALL cancer cells, is a part of the pathological molecular mechanism implicated in the exacerbation of this malignancy. Therefore, the genes involved in microRNAs biogenesis that have been studied here could be considered as candidate prognostic markers especially in childhood ALL which will help towards a better understanding of the molecular basis of ALL.",,PMC6658907,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AGO2', '*DICER', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*microRNA biogenesis']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7011-5637'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We postulated that LDL might also promote the opsonophagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by U937 cells since this bacterium interacts with LDL. In this study, P. aeruginosa (CMCC10104), U937 cells, and human LDL were used in phagocytosis assays to test our hypothesis. Escherichia coli strain BL21, which does not interact with LDL, was used as a negative control. Colony counting and fluorescence microscopy were used to determine the bacterial quantity in the opsonophagocytosis assays. After incubation of U937 cells and P. aeruginosa with LDL (100 microg/ml) for 15 and 30 min, phagocytosis was observed to be increased by 22.71% and 32.90%, respectively, compared to that seen in the LDL-free group. However, LDL did not increase the phagocytosis of E. coli by U937 cells. In addition, we identified CD36 as a major opsonin receptor on U937 cells, since an anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody, but not an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, almost completely abolished the opsonophagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by U937 cells.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'U937 cells', 'low-density lipoprotein', 'opsonophagocytosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data for CML-CP patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and receiving TKI therapy >/= 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. The CRAE (chronic renal adverse event, defined as a 30% eGFR reduction from baseline or eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) >/= 90 days whichever occurred first)-free survival rates at 3 years in the imatinib cohort (n = 360) were significantly lower than those in the nilotinib cohort (n = 100) (55% versus 77%, P = 0.001) as a first-line TKI therapy. In multivariate analyses, imatinib, male sex, increasing age, and previous non-TKI treatment were associated with poor CRAE-free survival. In newly diagnosed patients who received imatinib treatment (n = 40), 24-h urine protein levels significantly increased after 6 months, and urinary beta2-microglobulin values significantly increased compared to those in the nilotinib cohort (n =15) at 36 months (P = 0.042) and 42 months (P = 0.039). There was no significant difference in CRAE-free survival rates at 3 years between the nilotinib (n = 65) and dasatinib (n = 74) cohorts (67% versus 83%, P = 0.832) as second- or third-line TKI therapies. In multivariate analyses, previous non-TKI treatment was associated with poor CRAE-free survival. We concluded that imatinib was significantly correlated to chronic renal injury, possibly associated with glomerulus and renal tubular injury, compared with nilotinib as a first-line TKI therapy in CML-CP patients. However, nilotinib and dasatinib had similar mild adverse impacts on renal function as second- or third-line therapies.",['81770161/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic renal injury', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still considered a definitive curative modality for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, transplant-related morbidity and mortality remain a considerable challenge. The graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free with relapse-free survival (GRFS) rate and GRFS-related prognostic factors have not been fully examined for NHL alone. We evaluated 104 consecutive patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive NHL receiving allo-HSCT at a single institution. With a median follow-up of 31.5 months, the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), the cumulative incidence rates of relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 45.9%, 45.9%, 36.0%, and 17.0%, respectively. The patients with overall grades III-IV acute GVHD had markedly inferior OS and DFS (p = 0.040 for OS and p = 0.028 for DFS). However, patients with more than mild stage chronic GVHD showed superior OS and DFS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). The 1- and 3-year GRFS rates were 44.5% and 36.9%, respectively. The negative bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, chemosensitive disease status, and fewer exposure lines of chemotherapy before transplantation significantly increased the GRFS incidence. However, no transplant-associated factors were related to GRFS incidence. Furthermore, applying dynamic GRFS method which excepted patients whose chronic GVHD was fully resolved within short-period, survival rate significantly increased over time (36.9% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.045 for conventional GRFS vs. dynamic GRFS at 3 years after transplantation). In conclusion, these results suggest that GRFS is also a useful endpoint to assess transplant outcomes, and the dynamic GRFS calculation, including rapidly manageable chronic GVHD, is a more practical method for patients with refractory or relapsed heterogenous subtypes of NHL.",['NRF-2016R1A2B4007282/National Foundation of Korea (NRF)'],PMC6591200,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Endpoint', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Lymphoma']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5429-4839'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their very low frequency in the thymus, in-depth characterization of iNKT cells can be facilitated by their enrichment from total thymocytes. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) of glycolipid antigen-loaded CD1d-tetramer-binding cells is a commonly used method to enrich iNKT cells. Surprisingly, we found that this procedure also dramatically altered the subset composition of enriched iNKT cells. As such, NKT2 lineage cells that express large amounts of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger were markedly over-represented, while NKT1 lineage cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet were significantly reduced. To overcome this limitation, here, we tested magnetic-activated depletion of CD24(+) immature thymocytes as an alternative method to enrich iNKT cells. We found that the overall recovery in iNKT cell numbers did not differ between these 2 methods. However, enrichment by CD24(+) cell depletion preserved the subset composition of iNKT cells in the thymus, and thus permitted accurate and reproducible analysis of thymic iNKT cells in further detail.",,PMC6494763,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD1d tetramer, MACS', 'T-cell receptor', 'Thymocytes']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0333-6349', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5439-3239', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2242-5929', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9547-9055']",,['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiments were conducted on eleven cell lines with different proliferative activities and oxidative capacities, confirmed by conventional analytical tests. The data suggest that cancer cells and noncancer cells are characterized by a completely different redox status. This can be analyzed by EPR spectroscopy using mito-TEMPO and methoxy-TEMPO, but not carboxy-PROXYL. The correlation analysis shows that the EPR signal intensity of mito-TEMPO in cell suspensions is closely related to the superoxide level. The described methodology allows the detection of overproduction of superoxide in living cells and their identification based on the intracellular redox status.

Epub 2019 Mar 12.,"Aim: This study aimed to elucidate the ability of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) to integrate into cells of heterologous organisms, in particular, Wistar rats, and examine the manifestations of the pathological process that could be seen in them. Materials and Methods: Wistar rats - were divided into three groups. The first group (I) was fed milk of intact cows, the second (II) - milk of BLV-infected cows, and the third (III) - milk of cows, clinically BLV sick. Rats of all groups were divided into two subgroups: In the subgroup ""a"", there were adult rats, and in the subgroup ""b"", their offspring were included. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the start of the experiment, the animals' blood of each group was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of BLV provirus and specific anti-leukemia antibodies. A general and biochemical blood test was performed; pathological changes in the internal organs were recorded. Results: Using the PCR, the BLV infection was established in all experimental rats, whose immune response was expressed in varying degrees. At the initial stage of the infection, offspring rats were born healthy. The rats of the control groups Ia and Ib were intact to the BLV throughout the experiment. The biochemical blood tests have shown several signs of intoxication, endocrine disorders, and development of malignant processes in the experimental animals. There are also signs of liver, kidney, and myocardial damages, regardless of whether milk is infected or the cows are clinically leukemic. By the time, the experimental rats developed persistent thrombocytosis with an increase in the average volume of the blood platelets, which may be evidence of the leukemia infection by the megakaryocytic type. The most pronounced character of the change was in the offspring generation. Conclusion: Wistar rats can be considered as a suitable laboratory model to study the BLV pathogenesis. Rats are not BLV natural host, however, they developed the pathognomonic BLV infection symptoms when they were fed infected and leukemic cow's milk.",,PMC6487252,,['NOTNLM'],"['Wistar rats', 'cattle', 'danger to humans', 'hematobiochemical indicators', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) provides high cure rates for children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), relapses remain the main cause of treatment failure. Whereas donor killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype was shown to impact on relapse incidence in adult myeloid leukaemia similar studies in paediatric ALL are largely missing. Effect of donor KIR genotype on transplant outcome was evaluated in 317 children receiving a first myeloablative HSCT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor or sibling within the prospective ALL-SCT-BFM-2003 trial. Analysis of donor KIR gene polymorphism revealed that centromeric presence and telomeric absence of KIR B haplotypes was associated with reduced relapse risk. A centromeric/telomeric KIR score (ct-KIR score) integrating these observations correlated with relapse risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.58; P = 0.002) while it had no impact on graft-versus-host disease or non-relapse mortality. In multivariable analyses ct-KIR score was associated with reduced relapse risk (HR 0.58; P = 0.003) and a trend towards improved event-free survival (HR 0.76; P = 0.059). This effect proved independent of MRD level prior to HSCT. Our data suggest that in children with ALL undergoing HSCT after myeloablative conditioning, donor selection based on KIR genotyping holds promise to improve clinical outcome by decreasing relapse risk and prolonged event-free survival.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0369-8515', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7477-6632', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9553-1987', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5230-0628']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median number of AZA cycles was 5 (1-12) with 10 patients (33%) completing the 12 projected cycles. DLI were performed in 17 patients: 5 received one DLI, 2 received 2 DLI and 8 received 3 infusions. AZA was well tolerated, but discontinued in 20 patients primarily due to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and relapse. The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade 1-3 acute GvHD was 31.5% and the chronic GvHD CI was 53% at 2 years. At a median follow-up of 49 months (27-63), 18 patients are alive. The overall and disease-free survivals are 65.5% (CI 95% = 48.2-82.8) at 2 years. Cause of death was mainly relapse for 9 patients. The median time to relapse was 7 months (2.5-58) and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 27.6% (CI 95% = 12.8-44.6). These results confirm that AZA is well tolerated as a prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of post-transplantation relapse and compared favorably to those of patients who receive no post-transplant maintenance.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*azacitidine', '*donor lymphocyte infusion', '*relapse prevention']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3474-0002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One strategy to reduce the adverse effects is targeted therapy that can selectively deliver anticancer drugs to tumor cells. Immature laminin receptor protein (OFA/iLRP) is a potential target for AML treatment, because it is over-expressed on the surface of AML cells but under-expressed in normal tissue. In this study, we developed the first aptamer for OFA/iLRP and explored its potential as a targeting ligand for delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) to AML cells in vitro. The selected aptamer (AB3) was a 59-base DNA oligonucleotides. It bound to OFA/iLRP structure with a Kd of 101 nM and had minimal cross-reactivity to albumin, trypsin, or ovalbumin. Moreover, AB3 could bind to OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells but not the OFA/iLRP-negative control cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin (Apt-Dox) complex was formed by intercalating doxorubicin into the DNA structure of AB3. Apt-Dox selectively delivered Dox to OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells but notably decreased the drug intake by OFA/iLRP-negative control cells. In addition, cytotoxicity study revealed that Apt-Dox efficaciously destroyed the OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells, but significantly reduced the damage to control cells. The results indicate that the OFA/iLRP aptamer AB3 may have application potential in targeted therapy against AML.",,PMC6517398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (T-MN) are poorly characterized secondary hematological malignancies following chemotherapy/radiotherapy exposure. We compared the clinical and mutational characteristics of T-MN (n = 129) and primary myelodysplastic syndrome (P-MDS, n = 108) patients. Although the somatic mutation frequency was similar between T-MN and P-MDS patients (93% in both groups), the pattern was distinct. TP53 mutations were more frequent in T-MN (29.5 vs. 7%), while spliceosomal complex mutations were more common in P-MDS (56.5 vs. 25.6%). In contrast to P-MDS, the ring sideroblasts (RS) phenotype was not associated with better survival in T-MN, most probably due to genetic association with TP53 mutations. SF3B1 was mutated in 96% of P-MDS with >/=15% RS, but in only 32% T-MN. TP53 mutations were detected in 92% T-MN with >/=15% RS and SF3B1 wild-type cases. Interestingly, T-MN and P-MDS patients with ""Very low"" or ""Low"" Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) showed similar biological and clinical characteristics. In a Cox regression analysis, TP53 mutation was a poor prognostic factor in T-MN, independent of IPSS-R cytogenetics, disease-modifying therapy, and NRAS mutation. Our data have direct implications for T-MN management and provide evidence that, in addition to conventional disease parameters, mutational analysis should be incorporated in T-MN risk stratification.",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2315-091X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6957-8423', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5105-2554']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting mislocalization of oncogenes and tumor suppressors resulting from aberrant nuclear export is effective for inhibiting growth transformation of cancer cells. We performed a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) screening in a unique model of matched primary and oncogenic Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-transformed cells and identified genes that were growth promoting and growth suppressive for both types of cells, among which exportin XPO1 was demonstrated to be critical for the survival of transformed cells. Using XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, we confirmed the essential role of XPO1 in cell proliferation and growth transformation of KSHV-transformed cells and in cell lines of other cancers, including gastric cancer and liver cancer. XPO1 inhibition induced cell cycle arrest through p53 activation, but the mechanisms of p53 activation differed among the different types of cancer cells. p53 activation depended on the formation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in gastric cancer and liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, XPO1 inhibition induced relocalization of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1), recruiting p53 for activation in PML nuclear bodies. Taken the data together, we have identified novel growth-promoting and growth-suppressive genes of primary and cancer cells and have demonstrated that XPO1 is a vulnerable target of cancer cells. XPO1 inhibition induces cell arrest through a novel PML- and p62-dependent mechanism of p53 activation in some types of cancer cells.IMPORTANCE Using a model of oncogenic virus KSHV-driven cellular transformation of primary cells, we have performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify vulnerable genes of cancer cells. This screening is unique in that this virus-induced oncogenesis model does not depend on any cellular genetic alterations and has matched primary and KSHV-transformed cells, which are not available for similar screenings in other types of cancer. We have identified genes that are both growth promoting and growth suppressive in primary and transformed cells, some of which could represent novel proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In particular, we have demonstrated that the exportin XPO1 is a critical factor for the survival of transformed cells. Using a XPO1 inhibitor (KPT-8602) and siRNA-mediated knockdown, we have confirmed the essential role of XPO1 in cell proliferation and in growth transformation of KSHV-transformed cells, as well as of gastric and liver cancer cells. XPO1 inhibition induces cell cycle arrest by activating p53, but the mechanisms of p53 activation differed among different types of cancer cells. p53 activation is dependent on the formation of PML nuclear bodies in gastric and liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, XPO1 inhibition induces relocalization of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1), recruiting p53 for activation in PML nuclear bodies. These results illustrate that XPO1 is a vulnerable target of cancer cells and reveal a novel mechanism for blocking cancer cell proliferation by XPO1 inhibition as well as a novel PML- and p62-mediated mechanism of p53 activation in some types of cancer cells.","['R01 CA197153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025465/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6520457,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR-Cas9 screening', '*HHV8', '*KSHV', ""*Kaposi's sarcoma"", ""*Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus"", '*PML bodies', '*SQSTM1', '*XPO1', '*gastric cancer', '*human herpesvirus 8', '*liver cancer', '*p53', '*p62']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Gruffaz et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Altered splicing contributes to the pathogenesis of human blood disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and leukemias. Here we characterize the transcriptomic regulation of PRPF40B, which is a splicing factor mutated in a small fraction of MDS patients. We generated a full PRPF40B knockout (KO) in the K562 cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and rescued its levels by transient overexpression of wild-type (WT), P383L or P540S MDS alleles. Using RNA sequencing, we identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing (AS) events in the KO that are rescued by WT PRPF40B, with a majority also rescued by MDS alleles, pointing to mild effects of these mutations. Among the PRPF40B-regulated AS events, we found a net increase in exon inclusion in the KO, suggesting that this splicing factor primarily acts as a repressor. PRPF40B-regulated splicing events are likely cotranscriptional, affecting exons with A-rich downstream intronic motifs and weak splice sites especially for 5' splice sites, consistent with its PRP40 yeast ortholog being part of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Loss of PRPF40B in K562 induces a KLF1 transcriptional signature, with genes involved in iron metabolism and mainly hypoxia, including related pathways like cholesterol biosynthesis and Akt/MAPK signaling. A cancer database analysis revealed that PRPF40B is lowly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, whereas its paralog PRPF40A expression is high as opposed to solid tumors. Furthermore, these factors negatively or positively correlated with hypoxia regulator HIF1A, respectively.

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Gilteritinib is a potent and selective FLT3 kinase inhibitor with single-agent clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this context, however, gilteritinib is not curative, and response duration is limited by the development of secondary resistance. To evaluate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed baseline and progression samples from patients treated on clinical trials of gilteritinib. Targeted next-generation sequencing at the time of AML progression on gilteritinib identified treatment-emergent mutations that activate RAS/MAPK pathway signaling, most commonly in NRAS or KRAS. Less frequently, secondary FLT3-F691L gatekeeper mutations or BCR-ABL1 fusions were identified at progression. Single-cell targeted DNA sequencing revealed diverse patterns of clonal selection and evolution in response to FLT3 inhibition, including the emergence of RAS mutations in FLT3-mutated subclones, the expansion of alternative wild-type FLT3 subclones, or both patterns simultaneously. These data illustrate dynamic and complex changes in clonal architecture underlying response and resistance to mutation-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: Comprehensive serial genotyping of AML specimens from patients treated with the selective FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib demonstrates that complex, heterogeneous patterns of clonal selection and evolution mediate clinical resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibition in FLT3-mutated AML. Our data support the development of combinatorial targeted therapeutic approaches for advanced AML.See related commentary by Wei and Roberts, p. 998.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 983.","['R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001880/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA198621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA187577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9460-7177', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2838-2157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1463-2231']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Cancer Discov. 2019 Aug;9(8):998-1000.

Acalabrutinib is a potent, covalent BTK inhibitor with greater selectivity than ibrutinib. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of 100 mg of acalabrutinib twice daily or 200 mg once daily in patients with CLL who discontinued ibrutinib because of intolerance as determined by the investigators. Among 33 treated patients (61% men; median age, 64 years; range, 50-82 years), median duration of prior ibrutinib treatment was 11.6 months (range, 1-62 months); median time from ibrutinib discontinuation to acalabrutinib start was 47 days (range, 3-331 days). After a median of 19.0 months (range, 0.2-30.6 months), 23 patients remained on acalabrutinib; 10 had discontinued (progressive disease, n = 4; AEs, n = 3). No acalabrutinib dose reductions occurred. During acalabrutinib treatment, the most frequent AEs included diarrhea (58%), headache (39%), and cough (33%). Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 58%, most commonly neutropenia (12%) and thrombocytopenia (9%). Of 61 ibrutinib-related AEs associated with intolerance, 72% did not recur and 13% recurred at a lower grade with acalabrutinib. Overall response rate was 76%, including 1 complete and 19 partial responses and 5 partial responses with lymphocytosis. Among 25 responders, median duration of response was not reached. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached; 1-year PFS was 83.4% (95% confidence interval, 64.5%-92.7%). Acalabrutinib was well tolerated with a high response rate in patients who were previously intolerant to ibrutinib.

Epub 2019 Apr 4.,"BACKGROUND: In the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2013 recommendations, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with warning response (WR) were suggested to be monitored closely continuing with the same tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Differently, the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network considers switching to another TKI as an option. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 73 CML patients receiving first-line imatinib, who were followed and managed in accordance with ELN recommendations. We compared patients with molecular WR with patients with optimal response (OR) and failure regarding short- and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: The cumulative major molecular response (MMR) rates in patients with OR were significantly higher at any time point than those achieved by the WR group. Patients with WR at 3 months had significantly inferior failure-free survival (FFS) than optimal responders, but overall survival (OS) was similar. For 6 and 12 months, the WR and OR groups had similar FFS and OS. Twenty of 23 patients with WR at 12 months achieved MMR during imatinib treatment. CONCLUSION: It takes longer to get to ELN time points with imatinib than second-generation TKIs (2GTKIs). Treatment might fail in a small proportion of the patients with WR during imatinib treatment, but close and careful monitoring and timely switching to 2GTKIs might translate into favorable outcomes. Avoiding early switch to 2GTKIs would prevent patients from experiencing potential toxicities. There is still a need for prospective comparative studies (ie, continuing imatinib treatment vs. switching to 2GTKIs) in patients with WR, to justify the validity of this response category and to explore the benefit of treatment change in these patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*European LeukemiaNet (ELN)', '*Imatinib', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor', '*Warning']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 12.,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia is based on the presence of translocation t(9,22). Additional cytogenetic abnormalities may exist at diagnosis and have prognostic value. The authors evaluated the relationship between these additional chromosomal abnormalities, clinical presentation, and therapeutic response. METHOD: In a retrospective and comparative study from 2005 to 2015, at Yopougon university hospital, 51 cases of myeloid leukemia were selected, including 22 cases with additional chromosomal abnormalities. RESULTS: Thirteen types of additional Ph1 abnormalities were detected in one group, with a median age of 39years (13-73); a sex ratio of 1.4 and a low social class (49%). The median consultation time is 13months (2-29). Hepatomegaly (54%, P=0.05); fever (81.8%, P=0.0017); bone pain (63.6%, P=0.0001); lymphadenopathies (27.3% P=0.014); poor general condition [WHO>1 (77.3%, P=0.001)], high Sokal index (63.6%, P=0.0019), eosinophilia>5% (72.7, P=0.02) and circulating blastosis were found more frequent in the group with additional abnormalities treated with imatinib mesylate. We obtained 13.6% hematologic remission and 22.7% cytogenetic remission (P=0.02). The average survival was relatively short (20months vs. 76.4months, Log-rank<0.0001). We deplored a high death rate (59.1%).

However, the treatments lead to several long-term adverse effects, including cardiac toxicity. Although studies have reported associations between genetic variants and cardiorespiratory fitness, none has been performed on childhood ALL survivors. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 239 childhood ALL survivors from the PETALE cohort. Germline variants (both common and rare) in selected set of genes (N = 238) were analyzed for an association with cardiorespiratory fitness. RESULTS: Our results showed that the common variant in the TTN gene was significantly associated with a low cardiorespiratory fitness level (p = 0.0005) and that the LEPR, IGFBPI and ENO3 genes were significantly associated with a low cardiorespiratory fitness level in female survivors (p </= 0.002). Also, we detected an association between the low cardiorespiratory fitness level in participants that were stratified to the ""high risk"" prognostic group and functionally predicted rare variants in the SLC22A16 gene (p = 0.001). Positive associations between cardiorespiratory fitness level and trainability genes were mainly observed in females. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we observed that low cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood ALL survivors can be associated with variants in genes related to subjects' trainability. These findings could allow better childhood ALL patient follow-up tailored to their genetic profile and cardiorespiratory fitness, which could help reduce at least some of the burden of long-term adverse effects of treatments.",,PMC6515640,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness', 'Cardiovascular health', 'Genetic association study', 'Pediatric cancer survivorship', 'Trainability genes']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2904-9185'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decades, treatment of cALL has significantly improved, with cure rates close to 90%. However intensive chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy (CRT) during a critical period of a child's development have been shown to lead to significant long-term side effects including cardiometabolic complications. Using the PETALE (Prevenir les effets tardifs des traitements de la leucemie aigue lymphoblastique chez l'enfant) cALL survivor cohort, we investigated the association between combined cumulative corticosteroids (CS) doses and CRT exposures and obesity, insulin resistance, (pre-)hypertension, and dyslipidemia jointly. METHODS: A Bayesian multivariate latent-t model which accounted for our correlated binary outcomes was used for the analyses (n = 241 survivors). CS doses were categorized as low (LD) or high (HD). Combined exposure levels investigated were: 1) LD/no CRT; 2) LD/CRT, and; 3) HD/CRT. We also performed complementary sensitivity analyses for covariate adjustment. RESULTS: Prevalence of cardiometabolic complications ranged from 12.0% for (pre-)hypertension to 40.2% for dyslipidemia. The fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) for dyslipidemia associated with LD/CRT (vs. LD/No CRT) was OR = 1.98 (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.02 to 3.88). LD/CRT level also led to a 0.15 (95% CrI: 0.00 to 0.29) excess risk to develop at least one cardiometabolic complication. Except for obesity, adjusted results for the highest exposure category HD/CRT were generally similar to those for LD/CRT albeit not statistically significant. White blood cell count at diagnosis, a proxy for cALL burden at diagnosis, was found associated with insulin resistance (OR = 1.08 for a 10-unit increase (x 10(9)/L), 95% CrI: 1.02 to 1.14). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that combined LD/CRT exposure is a likely determinant of dyslipidemia among cALL survivors. No evidence was found to suggest that high doses of CS lead to additional risk for obesity, insulin resistance, (pre-)hypertension, and dyslipidemia beyond that induced by CRT. The multivariate model selected for analyses was judged globally useful to assess potential exposure-related concomitance of binary outcomes.",['CIHR/Canada'],PMC6515639,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Corticosteroids', '*Cranial radiotherapy', '*Dyslipidemia', '*Hypertension', '*Insulin resistance', '*Multivariate binary outcome model', '*Obesity']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7155-8218'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, increasing evidences suggest that tumor cells are capable of regulating polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of how colon cancer cell impacts tumor-associated macrophages polarization. METHODS: We employed flow cytometry to detect marker molecules on macrophage membrane, such as CD68, CD16, and CD204. In addition, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine the level of these cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-10, and Arginase-1) secreted by colon cancer cells into the culture medium. Western blot was utilized to probe downstream proteins of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. RESULTS: We cocultured colon cancer cell lines (HCT8 or HCT116) with human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1) and found that interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta levels were reduced, and instead, interleukin-10 and Arginase-1 levels were elevated, suggesting that colon cancer cells contributed to M2 polarization of THP-1. Meanwhile, high level of various growth factors (transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta], epidermal growth factor [EGF], and hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]) was observed in the medium of THP-1 cocultured with colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the protein level of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR significantly increased in THP-1 cell cocultured with colon cancer cells compared to THP-1 group. Besides, we established that colon cancer cells exerted their stimulatory effect on M2 polarization of macrophage from monocyte THP-1 using EGFR antibody mAb225 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that EGF which are secreted by colon cancer cells play contributory role in M2 polarization of macrophages, which support the notion that tumor environment, including tumor-associated macrophages, can be targeted to develop effective strategies for treating cancer.",,PMC6535704,,['NOTNLM'],"['*EGF/EGFR', '*M2 polarization', '*PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway', '*colon cancer cell', '*macrophage']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4740-1181'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) is a final goal of various recent studies, in which combination of different compounds and conventional chemotherapeutics results in circumventing MDR and hence cancer progression. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-gamma on MDR in doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia cells. The effect of doxorubicin on cell viability following treatment with ciglitazone was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as one of the membrane transporters, was determined by the rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) assay. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used for the measurement of P-gp, and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expression at mRNA and protein, respectively. For evaluation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced apoptosis by annexin V/PI staining was used. Ciglitazone significantly increases the cytotoxic effects of DOX. In addition, ciglitazone considerably decreased the expression levels and activity of P-gp in DOX-resistant K562 cells. Furthermore, upon the ciglitazone treatment, PTEN expression could be increased in K562/DOX cells in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. Moreover, ciglitazone significantly enhanced DOX-induced apoptosis in K562/DOX cells. The combination treatment of K562/DOX leukemia cancer cells with doxorubicin and ciglitazone might be an effective strategy in inducing apoptosis and reversing developed MDR, and more importantly decreasing the adverse side effects of these agents.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDR', '*PI3K/Akt', '*PPAR-gamma', '*ciglitazone', '*leukemia']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9776-5816'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The systematic search followed the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guideline. Two databases systems were used (MEDLINE and EMBASE). PROSPERO was searched for ongoing or recently completed systematic reviews. The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search was searched for ongoing or recently completed trials. Level of evidence was evaluated based on the Oxford Level of Evidence. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to summarize the evidence. RESULTS: Only 18 articles were selected and included in data synthesis and analysis. The level of evidence and recommendation ranged from 1 to 5 and A to D, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All the included studies in the data synthesis (n = 18) showed no specific guidelines were followed; however, all reflected the importance of liaison with the patient's hematoncologist at all stages of MDS and/or AML therapy. RECOMMENDATIONS: Oral and dental assessment is crucial prior to MDS therapy to help reduce anticipated complications. Dental treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and/or active stage of MDS therapy is tricky and always required liaison with the hematoncologist. MDS can progress to AML; hence, dental care providers are in a good position to spot any changes and refer early to the hematoncologist for further assessment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'dental extraction', 'hematoncology', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'neutropenia', 'special care dentistry', 'thrombocytopenia']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3817-3938'],"['(c) 2019 Special Care Dentistry Association and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The high homology and the inverted orientation of RHD and RHCE may give rise to non-functional and aberrant RH alleles. RH genotyping is used to screen RH matched donors to African descent patients. This study aimed to define a strategy for testing RHD and RHCE variants in blood donors to provide compatible units for transfusion of patients with haematological diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 132 patients [101 Sickle cell disease (SCD), 14 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 17 acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML)] and 198 Brazilian donors were studied. Major blood group alleles, RHD, RHCE alleles and RHD zygosity were determined by the blood-MLPA assay. Sequencing was performed to determine RHD and RHCE variant subtypes. A match was an RH genotype that did not encode Rh antigens absent in the patient, along with matching for ABO, MNS, KEL, FY, JK and DI antigens. RESULTS: Overall, 7.6% of blood donors and 17.4% of patients presented RH genotypes that predict expression of partial Rh antigens or lack of high prevalence Rh antigens. From 23 patients with clinically relevant RH genotypes, 15 had available matched donors. CONCLUSION: We report the presence of clinically relevant RH genotypes in SCD and in non-SCD patients. In our admixed population, many patients carry variant RHCE alleles in heterozygosity with normal RHCE alleles. Thus, our results suggest that donors could be selected based on the normal RH allele.","['474769/2013-5/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico', 'Coordenacao De Aperfeicoamento De Pessoal De Nivel Superior']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['RHCE', 'RHD', 'RH variants', 'blood group genotyping', 'haematological diseases']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6940-0262', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0636-4556']",['(c) 2019 International Society of Blood Transfusion.'],,,"['GENBANK/NG_007494', 'GENBANK/NG_009208']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 14.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal malignancies. The PTEN/AKT signalling pathway is closely related to the tumourigenesis and progression of PC. The downstream effectors, FOXO3a, PLZF and VEGF, are reported to be involved in angiogenesis, lymph node metastasis and poor survival in PC. By using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, we found, that PTEN, FOXO3a and PLZF expression was significantly decreased in PC specimens compared with that in chronic pancreatitis (CP) specimens, while VEGF expression was significantly increased. Furthermore, the expression of PTEN was positively correlated with that of FOXO3a and PLZF but negatively correlated with that of VEGF. Our results suggest that the PTEN/FOXO3a/PLZF signalling pathway may negatively regulate VEGF expression in PC. Through clinical analysis of 69 PC patients, PTEN, FOXO3a and PLZF expression was found to be significantly decreased in specimens from PC patients with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, while VEGF expression was significantly increased. Taken together, these reaults suggest that the PTEN/FOXO3a/PLZF signalling pathway may be capable of inhibiting growth and metastasis in PC by regulating VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, which requires further in vivo and in vitro studies and can potentially be a therapeutic target for PC.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Angiogenesis', '*PTEN/FOXO3a/PLZF signalling pathway', '*Pancreatic cancer', '*VEGF']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of what we know about viral immunity comes from studies using mouse models. Experiments using the Friend virus (FV) model have been particularly informative in defining highly complex anti-retroviral mechanisms of the intrinsic, innate and adaptive arms of immunity. FV studies have unraveled fundamental principles about how the immune system controls both acute and chronic viral infections. They led to a more complete understanding of retroviral immunity that begins with cellular sensing, production of type I interferons, and the induction of intrinsic restriction factors. Novel mechanisms have been revealed, which demonstrate that these earliest responses affect not only virus replication, but also subsequent innate and adaptive immunity. This review on FV immunity not only surveys the complex host responses to a retroviral infection from acute infection to chronicity, but also highlights the many feedback mechanisms that regulate and counter-regulate the various arms of the immune system. In addition, the discovery of molecular mechanisms of immunity in this model have led to therapeutic interventions with implications for HIV cure and vaccine development.","['R01 AI116603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI134220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'FC001099/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC6735856,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Friend retrovirus', '*adaptive immunity', '*immunotherapy', '*innate immunity', '*intrinsic immunity', '*mouse model']",,['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of FEMS 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 16.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the agent responsible for enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease in cattle. The horn fly, a major hematophagous pest of cattle, is able to transmit different diseases in cattle. However, its implication in BLV transmission under a natural environment is still discussed. The objectives of this work were to determine the presence of BLV in horn flies (by sequencing) and to evaluate the ability of horn flies to transmit BLV to cattle (through an experimental assay under a natural environment). To demonstrate the presence of BLV in the flies, 40 horn flies were collected from a BLV-positive cow with a sweep net and 10 pools with four horn-fly mouthparts each were prepared. The presence of BLV was determined by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. To demonstrate BLV transmission, other 40 flies were collected from the same BLV-positive cow with a sweep net. Eight homogenates containing five horn-fly mouthparts each were prepared and injected to eight cows of different breeds, and blood samples were collected every 21 days. Then, to evaluate the ability of horn flies to transmit BLV to grazing cattle under natural conditions, both infected and uninfected cattle from the experimental transmission assay were kept together in the same paddock with more than 200 horn flies per animal for 120 days.

Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous T-cell therapy that is genetically engineered with a lentiviral vector to seek and eliminate CD19-expressing B cells throughout the patient's body and retain antitumor immune surveillance following remission. This groundbreaking cellular therapy brings unprecedented single-agent efficacy to patients with RR ALL, citing complete response rates of greater than 80% and 6-month relapse-free survivals exceeding 60% in a patient population with poor prognosis and few treatment options. Patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy are at risk for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and infections, along with other toxicities that may be severe or life-threatening. The cornerstone of the management of moderate to severe CRS is treatment with the interleukin-6 antagonist tocilizumab, with dramatic responses often occurring within 24 hours. The optimal management of neurotoxicity following tisagenlecleucel remains undefined. It is critical that providers caring for patients receiving tisagenlecleucel understand the multistep process to prepare a patient for therapy, how to closely monitor patients for toxicity, and how to manage emergent adverse events following cell infusion.",,PMC6505546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This study was conducted at Haematology (Pathology) department, Army Medical College, in collaboration with Immunology Department Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from 16 November 2016 to 16 November 2017. One hundred and six patients of both genders and all age groups diagnosed as acute myeloid leukaemia were included in the study. Demographic data was noted. Complete blood counts, bone marrow examination and cytochemical stains were carried out and evaluated microscopically for blast percentage and morphology. Immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry using standard panel on peripheral blood or bone marrow samples. The surface and cytoplasmic antigens of interest were analysed and correlated with morphological findings. Results: The most commonly expressed antigens were CD13, CD33, CD45 and HLA-DR. Almost all blasts expressed CD45 with no remarkable difference among the subtypes of AML. The mean positivity for CD13 among all AML subtypes was 57% and for CD33 was 67%. Aberrant expression of CD7 and CD19 were expressed in 26.4% and 1.1% of all cases respectively. There was concordance rate of 90% between morphology and FCM in our study. Conclusion: Flow cytometric analysis of acute leukaemia done by a combination of patterns and intensity of antigen expression improves diagnostic yield in AML. CD13, CD33 and CD45 are the most frequently expressed antigens in AML. Our findings suggest a 90% concordance between morphology and flow cytometry. It is pertinent to conclude that flow cytometry results interpreted with morphology are complementary.",,PMC6500804,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aberrant phenotype in AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Flowcytometry', 'Immunophenotyping']",,,['Conflict of Interest: None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxidative stress is one of the key factors in the onset and progression of AMD. In this study, metabolites associated with AMD pathology more so at the systemic level namely, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), homocysteine (Hcy), homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), advanced glycation end product (AGE) were evaluated for their pro-oxidant nature in a localized ocular environment based on in vitro studies in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells). Human ARPE-19 cells were treated with pro-oxidants 50 mug/mL oxLDL, 500 muM Hcy, 500 nM HCTL, 100 mug/mL AGE, 200 muM H2O2 and 200 muM H2O2 with and without pre-treatment of 5 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). The cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted from ARPE-19 cells exposed to pro-oxidants were estimated by ELISA. In vitro angiogenesis assay was performed with conditioned media of the pro-oxidant treated ARPE-19 cells in Geltrex-Matrigel coated 96-well plate. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was differentiated into macrophages and its migration in response to conditioned media of ARPE-19 cells insulted with the pro-oxidants was studied by transwell migration assay. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB to assess apoptotic changes. The compounds involved in the study showed a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ARPE-19 cells (oxLDL; Hcy; AGE: p < 0.001 and HCTL: p < 0.05). NAC pre-treatment significantly lowered the oxidative stress brought about by pro-oxidants as seen by lowered ROS and MDA levels in the cells. Treatment with pro-oxidants significantly increased the secretion of IL-6 (oxLDL: p < 0.05; Hcy, HCTL and AGE: p < 0.01) and IL-8 cytokines (oxLDL: p < 0.05; HCTL: p <. 001 and AGE: p < 0.01) in ARPE-19 cells. Serum samples of AMD patients (n = 23) revealed significantly higher IL-6 and IL-8 levels compared to control subjects (n = 23) (IL6: p < 0.01 and IL8: p < 0.05). The pro-oxidants also promoted VEGF secretion by ARPE-19 cells compared to untreated control (oxLDL: p < 0.001; Hcy: p < 0.01; HCTL and AGE: p < 0.05). In vitro angiogenesis assay showed that the conditioned media significantly increased the tube formation in RF/6A endothelial cells. Transwell migration assay revealed significant infiltration of macrophages in response to pro-oxidants. We further demonstrated that the pro-oxidants increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased the NF-kappaB activation resulting in pro-apoptotic changes in ARPE-19 cells. Thus, oxLDL, Hcy, HCTL and AGE act as pro-oxidant metabolites in RPE that promote AMD through oxidative stress, inflammation, chemotaxis and neovascularization.",,PMC6516731,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8147-1589'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we systematically address the relationship between poised, active and silent chromatin, by integrating 73 publications on PcG/TrxG biochemistry into a mathematical model comprising 144 nucleosome modification states and 8 enzymatic reactions. Our model predicts that poised chromatin is bistable and not bivalent. Bivalent chromatin, containing opposing active and silent modifications, is present as an unstable background population in all system states, and different subtypes co-occur with active and silent chromatin. In contrast, bistability, in which the system switches frequently between stable active and silent states, occurs under a wide range of conditions at the transition between monostable active and silent system states. By proposing that bistability and not bivalency is associated with poised chromatin, this work has implications for understanding the molecular nature of pluripotency.","['740704/EC | EC Seventh Framework Programm | FP7 Ideas: European Research Council', '(FP7-IDEAS-ERC - Specific Programme: ""Ideas"" Implementing the Seventh Framework', 'Programme of the European Community for Research, Technological Development and', 'Demonstration Activities (2007 to 2013))/International', '813282/EC | EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020 | H2020', 'Priority Excellent Science | H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (H2020', 'Excellent Science - Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions)/International']",PMC6513952,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9820-3567', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2887-7528']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otherwise, the ""de novo"" appearance of a cavernoma in an elderly long-survivor patient after resection and radiotherapy of a glioblastoma is a rare event. We report the case of a 62-year-old female patient who underwent surgical resection of a right temporal glioblastoma, followed by radiation therapy of the operative field and surrounding brain and concomitant adjuvant temozolomide. Four years after the operation, a follow-up Magnetic Resonance revealed a good tumor control and a small round lesion at the superior surface of the right cerebellar hemisphere, close to the margins of the previous irradiation field. The radiological items were consistent with a cavernous angioma. Because of the small size of the malformation and the absence of related symptoms, no treatment was performed. The patient died for tumor progression 86 months after the initial operation, with unchanged cerebellar cavernoma. The occurrence of a cavernous angioma in an elderly patient after radiotherapy for brain glioblastoma is an exceptional event; the distribution of radiotherapy-induced cavernous malformations reported in current literature is presented and the mechanism of their formation is discussed.",,PMC6625569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 13.,"Aging is associated with functional decline of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as well as an increased risk of myeloid malignancies. We performed an integrative characterization of epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, including single-cell RNA sequencing, during normal human aging. Lineage(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells [HSC-enriched (HSCe)] undergo age-associated epigenetic reprogramming consisting of redistribution of DNA methylation and reductions in H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3. This reprogramming of aged HSCe globally targets developmental and cancer pathways that are comparably altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of all ages, encompassing loss of 4,646 active enhancers, 3,091 bivalent promoters, and deregulation of several epigenetic modifiers and key hematopoietic transcription factors, such as KLF6, BCL6, and RUNX3. Notably, in vitro downregulation of KLF6 results in impaired differentiation, increased colony-forming potential, and changes in expression that recapitulate aging and leukemia signatures. Thus, age-associated epigenetic reprogramming may form a predisposing condition for the development of age-related AML. SIGNIFICANCE: AML, which is more frequent in the elderly, is characterized by epigenetic deregulation. We demonstrate that epigenetic reprogramming of human HSCs occurs with age, affecting cancer and developmental pathways. Downregulation of genes epigenetically altered with age leads to impairment in differentiation and partially recapitulates aging phenotypes.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 983.","['R01 HL122661/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL148865/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA217835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA226802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7080409,['NIHMS1529545'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9689-2469', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8162-6758']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with NPM1 (-) MN, NPM1 (+) MN were associated with younger age (P = .007), a normal karyotype (P < .0001), more frequent mutations involving DNMT3A (P = .01) and PTPN11 (P = .03), and fewer involving ASXL1 (P = .003), RUNX1 (P = .0004), and TP53 (P = .02). Mutations involving IDH1 or IDH2 (IDH1/2) (P = .007) and FLT3 (internal tandem duplication, P < .0001; noninternal tandem duplication, P = .01) were less frequent in NPM1 (+) MN than in NPM1 (+) AML. In multivariable analyses performed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome only, total mutation count (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; P = .05), NPM1 mutation (HR, 3.6; P = .02), TP53 mutation (HR, 5.2; P = .01), and higher International Prognostic Scoring System-R score (HR, 1.7; P = .0003) were independently associated with shorter overall survival, whereas stem cell transplant conferred a favorable effect (HR, 0.1; P < .0001). These data suggest that NPM1 (+) MN are biologically distinct from NPM1 (-) MN. Similar to NPM1 (+) AML, patients with NPM1-mutated myelodysplastic syndrome may benefit from more intensive therapeutic regimens.","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6517660,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5448-4635', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5880-9337']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 11.,"Assessments of overall improvement and worsening of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) manifestations by the algorithm recommended by National Institutes of Health (NIH) response criteria do not align closely with those reported by providers, particularly when patients have mixed responses with improvement in some manifestations but worsening in others. To elucidate the changes that influence provider assessment of response, we used logistic regression to generate an overall change index based on specific manifestations of chronic GVHD measured at baseline and 6 months later. We hypothesized that this overall change index would correlate strongly with overall improvement as determined by providers. The analysis included 488 patients from 2 prospective observational studies who were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to discovery and replication cohorts. Changes in bilirubin and scores of the lower gastrointestinal tract, mouth, joint/fascia, lung, and skin were correlated with provider-assessed improvement, suggesting that the main NIH response measures capture relevant information. Conversely, changes in the eye, esophagus, and upper gastrointestinal tract did not correlate with provider-assessed response, suggesting that these scales could be modified or dropped from the NIH response assessment. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve in the replication cohort was 0.72, indicating that the scoring algorithm for overall change based on NIH response measures is not well calibrated with provider-assessed response.",['R01 CA118953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6755054,['NIHMS1529560'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic graft-versus-host disease', '*Hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Treatment response']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 11.,"Data on whether the T cell dose of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products influences transplantation outcomes are conflicting. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we identified 2736 adult patients who underwent first allogeneic PBSC transplantation for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2008 and 2014 using an HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) or an 8/8-matched unrelated donor (MUD). We excluded ex vivo and in vivo T cell-depleted transplantations. Correlative analysis was performed between CD3(+) T cell dose and the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Using maximum likelihood estimation, we identified CD3(+) T cell dose cutoff that separated the risk of acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II-IV in both the MSD and MUD groups. A CD3(+) T cell dose cutoff of 14x10(7) cells/kg identified MSD/low CD3(+) (n=223) and MSD/high CD3(+) (n=1214), and a dose of 15x10(7) cells/kg identified MUD/low CD3(+) (n=197) and MUD/high CD3(+) (n=1102). On univariate analysis, the MSD/high CD3(+) group had a higher cumulative incidence of day +100 aGVHD grade II-IV compared with the MSD/low CD3(+) group (33% versus 25%; P=.009). There were no differences between the 2 groups in engraftment rate, risk of aGVHD grade III-IV or chronic GVHD (cGVHD), NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS. The MUD/high CD3(+) group had a higher cumulative incidence of day +100 aGVHD grade II-IV compared with the MUD/low CD3(+) group (49% versus 41%; P=.04). There were no differences between the 2 groups in engraftment rate, risk of severe aGVHD or cGVHD, NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS. Multivariate analysis of the MSD and MUD groups failed to show an association between CD3(+) T cell dose and the risk of either aGVHD grade II-IV (P=.10 and .07, respectively) or cGVHD (P=.80 and .30, respectively). Subanalysis of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio failed to identify cutoff values predictive of transplantation outcomes; however, using the log-rank test, the sample size was suboptimal for identifying a difference at this cutoff cell dose. In this registry study, the CD3(+) T cell dose of PBSC products did not influence the risk of aGVHD or cGVHD or other transplantation outcomes when using an MSD or an 8/8-matched MUD. Subset analyses of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell doses were not possible given our small sample size.","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA188523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7071947,['NIHMS1551555'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic', '*GVHD dose', '*T cell', '*Transplantation']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed in order to prolong the disease-free survival of AML patients in clinic. Here, we report that BBI608 is highly active against diverse AML cell lines in vitro and primary samples obtained from patients with AML ex vivo, as well as effective in vivo in AML xenograft models. Meanwhile, the anti-AML property of BBI608 is closely associated with the inhibition of Stat3 pathway and induction of DNA damage. Of note, BBI608 combined with Bcl-2 inhibitor (i.e., ABT-199) exerts a significantly enhanced anti-leukemia effect in BBI608-resistant cell line Kasumi-1. Together, the present findings suggest that BBI608 might represent a potential candidate agent for AML treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BBI608', 'DNA damage', 'Stat3']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was performed on a population of 98 patients with AML, aged up to 16 years, seen in a single hospital from 2004 to 2015. RESULTS: Among the 80 patients for whom it was possible to analyze the karyotype, 78.7% had chromosomal changes, the most frequent being t(15;17)(q22;q21). Of the 86 patients for whom we had cytogenetic or molecular data, making it possible to classify their AML according to the WHO classification, 52.3% belonged to the group with recurrent genetic abnormalities, 22% to the ""AML not otherwise specified"" group, 18.6% to the group with myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic changes, and 7% to the group with Down syndrome-related leukemia. Five-year overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 49.7%+/-5.2%. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, patients with myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic changes (OS 28.1%+/-12.2%) and those with ""AML not otherwise specified"" (OS 36.1%+/-11.2%) had an unfavorable prognosis when compared to patients with AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (OS 71%+/-5.8%) and patients with Down syndrome-related AML (OS 83%+/-15.2%, p=0.011).

Epub 2019 Mar 28.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes of intolerant, relapsed or refractory patients who could not be treated with new tyrosine kinase inhibitors or experimental therapies. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 90 chronic myeloid leukemia patients in all phases of the disease treated with imatinib mesylate as their first TKI therapy, and with dasatinib or nilotinib as the next line of therapy. We evaluated clinical outcomes of these patients, with special focus on the group that needed more than two therapy lines. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of patients were refractory or intolerant to imatinib. An 8-year overall survival rate of the patients who went through three or more lines of treatment was significantly lower, compared to those who were able to maintain imatinib as their first-line therapy (83% and 22%, respectively p<0.01). Decreased overall survival was associated with advanced-phase disease (p<0.01), failure to achieve major molecular response in first-line treatment (p<0.01) and interruption of first-line treatment due to any reason (p=0.023). Failure in achieving complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response and treatment interruption were associated with the progression to the third-line treatment. CONCLUSION: The critical outcome observed in relapsed, intolerant or refractory chronic phase CML patients reflects the unmet need for this group of patients without an alternative therapy, such as new drugs or experimental therapies in clinical trials. Broader access to newer treatment possibilities is a crucial asset to improve survival among CML patients, especially those refractory or intolerant to first-line therapies.",,PMC6732531,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Nilotinib', 'Survival analysis']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

METHODS: The study included 367 patients diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia over a ten-year period at a reference treatment center. Records of patient charts and the TerraView software were used, respectively, for data collection and geographic mapping of the cases from the twelve established State development regions. RESULTS: A total incidence of 3.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was found, with a predominance of the disease among males, a median age of 47 years, a mestizo ethnicity, with elementary schooling and residence in urban area. Microregional incidence varied, but there was no significant variation in numbers over the years, and no relevant socio-environmental determinants were identified. CONCLUSION: The present study determined the incidence and characterized the spatial distribution of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cases over a decade in a northeastern Brazilian state. The variation in the incidence rate by region of development is compatible with a homogeneous distribution of the cases.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to re-evaluate the CD9 cellular expression by flow cytometry (FC) as a possible tool to predict the presence of ETV6-RUNX1. METHOD: Childhood B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia cases were included (n=186). The percentage of CD9-labeled cells and the median fluorescence intensity ratio were used for correlation with the molecular tests. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were performed to determine the likelihood of the CD9 expression predicting ETV6-RUNX1. RESULTS: The ETV6-RUNX1 was found in 44/186 (23.6%) cases. Data analysis revealed that the best cutoff for CD9 percentage was 64%, with an accuracy of 0.84, whereas the best cutoff for CD9 median fluorescence intensity ratio was 12.52, with an accuracy of 0.80. A strong association was observed between the level of CD9 expression and the presence of ETV6-RUNX1.

Epub 2018 Dec 29.,"BACKGROUND: Older patients with acute myeloid leukemia are particularly difficult to treat, as they have a high risk of comorbidities, poor performance status and less tolerability to chemotherapy, as well as a more aggressive disease biology, responsible for the resistance to treatment. There is a need to explore novel therapeutic agents that are more effective and tolerable. Venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor is a promising agent, as BCL-2 overexpression is present in 84% of acute myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis and 95% of patients at relapse and has been associated with leukemia cell survival, chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To review the available data about venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia and how it can influence the treatment in older patients. METHODS: Using the Pubmed database, we selected 29 articles published within the last 15 years, considering preclinical and clinical trials and review studies that combined venetoclax with acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Venetoclax has demonstrated promising results in preclinical and clinical trials, especially in patients with poor prognosis and the IDH mutation, with an excellent side-effect profile. However, resistance seems to develop rapidly with venetoclax monotherapy, because of antiapoptotic escape mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: While the results with the use of venetoclax seem encouraging, it is not likely that targeting a single pathway will result in long-term disease control. The solution includes the use of combined therapy to block resistance mechanisms and enhance apoptosis, by reducing MCL-1, increasing BIM or inhibiting the complex IV in the mitochondria.",,PMC6517609,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'AML', 'BCL-2', 'BH3-mimetics', 'Target therapy', 'Venetoclax']",,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Therapy with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is able to induce complete remission (CR) in the majority of patients after a single course of treatment. We report the outcomes of patients treated at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: This was a retrospective review. Medical records of patients were used to collect data. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with cladribine. All patients achieved an initial CR. Four patients (19%) required hospitalization and therapy for neutropenic fever. Six patients (29%) relapsed at a median of 48 months. All 6 patients were treated for relapse, out of which 4 achieved CR, 1 had partial response and 1 had refractory disease. The overall survival rate was 90.5%, with a median follow-up of 35 months. CONCLUSION: A single course of cladribine is able to induce CR in a vast majority of patients. Unfortunately, relapse is not uncommon. Patients who relapse can be successfully retreated with cladribine. Cladribine has impressive efficacy and a favorable acute and long-term toxicity profile when administered to patients with HCL.",,PMC6517679,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine', 'Cladribine', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Outcome']",,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

METHODS: Research was conducted on 3 cell lines derived from the human hematopoietic system: HL-60, HL-60/MX1 and HL-60/MX2. After exposure to coumarin compounds, cells were subjected to cytometric analysis to determine the induction of apoptosis by two methods: the Annexin V test with propidium iodide and the PhiPhiLux-G1D2 reagent containing caspase 3 antibodies.

This study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of EMR.We retrospectively investigated 316 consecutive patients undergoing HSCT for acute leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at 2 institutions between January 2012 and February 2017. Furthermore, we analyzed and compared the risk factors and outcomes between EMR and bone marrow relapse (BMR).The 5-year cumulative incidence of EMR was 14.1%. The EMR incidence in acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, and CML was 17.5%, 18.9%, and 5.3%, respectively. CML had a lower EMR incidence rate. Compared to the BMR group, the EMR group had a longer median relapse-free time (10.5 months vs 5 months, P = .02), and the EMR group had a higher incidence rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (50.0% vs 20.9%, P = .009). EMR had better estimated 3-year survival rates post-HSCT, and post-relapse, than did BMR (39.5% vs 9.5%, P < .001, and 21.9% vs 10.8%, P = .001). Multivariate analysis identified that adverse cytogenetics (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.034, P < .001) and extramedullary leukemia before HSCT (HR = 2.685, P = .027) were the independent risk factors for EMR after HSCT. In the EMR group, patients who achieved complete remission (CR) had a significantly better, estimated 3-year survival than did patients who did not achieve CR (38.4% vs 14.3%, P = .014).EMR is a significant contributor to mortality after HSCT, which appears to be resistant to most of the current therapies. Establishing effective strategies for EMR is important in improving outcomes after HSCT.",,PMC6531281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few cases of atypical APL, including PLZF-RARalpha, F1P1L1-RARalpha, STAT5b-RARalpha, et al. Neither PLZF-RARalpha nor STAT5b-RARalpha are sensitive to ATRA and ATO, and the prognosis is poor. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we have 3 cases (PLZF-RARalpha, n = 2; STAT5b-RARalpha, n = 1). Case A, A 53-year-old Chinese female had suffered ecchymosis in both legs for 3 days. Case B, A 44 years old male suffered pain from lower limbs and hip. Case C, 52-year-old male patient presented with fever for 3 weeks invalid to antibiotics and gingival bleeding for 1 week. DIAGNOSES: With RT-PCR and karyotype, Case A is diagnosed with STAT5b-RARalpha-positive APL.Case B, C are diagnosed with PLZF-RARalpha-positive APL. INTERVENTIONS: In case A, ATO, and ATRA were used for induction treatment. In Case B, ATO, and chemotherapy with DA were given in the first induction treatment. In Case C, ATRA, and ATO were used immediately, subsequently, chemotherapy was added with DA, ATRA, and CAG combination treatment, and medium-dose cytarabine with daunorubicin were given regularly. OUTCOMES: In Case A, the patient refused the following treatment and discharged on day 25. In Case B, the patient got the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).In Case C, the patient has survived for 7 months and remains CR. LESSONS: Both STAT5b-RARalpha-positive APL and PLZF-RARalpha-positive APL appear to be resistant to both ATRA and ATO, so combined chemotherapy and allo-HSCT should be considered. Since the prognosis and long-term outcome are poor, more clinical trials, and researches should be taken.",,PMC6531224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also found that tropinone-thiazole derivatives exhibit high tyrosinase inhibitory activity. The lead compounds 3g and 3h showed tyrosinase inhibition effect, with IC50 values 3.22 and 3.51muM, respectively. These inhibitory activities are 22 times higher than the activity of kojic acid (IC50 72.27muM) and 120 times higher than activity of ascorbic acid (IC50 386.5muM).

The aim of the study is to report the experience within the I-CML-Ped study in children and adolescents presenting at diagnosis with advanced phase disease and to describe their characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: Of 479 children and adolescents enrolled in the international registry for childhood chronic myeloid leukaemia (I-CML-Ped Study; www.clinicaltrials.govNCT01281735), 36 children (7.5%) presented at initial diagnosis with CML in advanced phase according to the European LeukemiaNet criteria. RESULTS: Nineteen (4%) patients were diagnosed in accelerated phase (CML-AP), and among the 17 patients (3.5%) diagnosed in blastic phase (CML-BP), 70% presented with lymphoid immunophenotype. Initial treatment of CML-AP/CML-BP consisted of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with or without chemotherapy, leading to complete haematologic response in 33 of 36 (92%) patients. Seventeen patients proceeded to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At the last follow-up, 18 of 19 patients with de novo CML-AP are alive in at least major molecular response (MMR) (n = 16), in progression (n = 1) or in molecular relapse (n = 1) and 13 of 17 patients with de novo CML-BP are alive in at least MMR. Five-year overall survival rates are 94% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-99%) and 74% (95% CI: 44%-89%) for patients diagnosed in CML-AP and CML-BP, respectively. CONCLUSION: Children with advanced phase at diagnosis of CML seem to have a better survival rate than that reported for advanced phases evolving under TKI treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Children', '*Chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*Imatinib', '*Stem cell transplantation', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Patients usually have a prior diagnosis of systemic leukemia or myelodysplasia. However, cutaneous lesions may present as the primary manifestation of systemic disease in rare cases.

T-PLL is often widespread at diagnosis and involves the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin.

We collected RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of human CLL, ALL samples, and normal peripheral blood CD19+ B cells as well as thymus samples, and analyzed similarities and differences between their transcriptomes using Cuffdiff2, DESeq, and edgeR. Compared with the RNA-seq data of normal peripheral blood CD19+ B cells and thymus samples, there were a large number of DEGs in ALL and CLL. DEGs in ALL and CLL not only have their distinguished features but also have a similar pattern. To figure out the common DEGs between CLL and ALL, we further identified 26 overlapped genes between CLL and ALL, among which 10 genes showed similar expression variation profiles whereas 16 genes showed opposite variation. The expression levels of 10 genes (SCML4, TNF-alpha, CD1C, FGFR1, MYO7B, DUSP1, PAP1GAP, MAN1C1, SLFN5, and CD8A) among the 26 genes were further confirmed by experiments, which was consistent with the results obtained by analyzing the RNA-seq data.

The central strategy in BsAb engineering is to combine the specificities directed at effector cells, and at a tumor target associated antigen (TAA) into a single construct. AREAS COVERED: This article highlights the clinical use of BsAbs to target effector cells to multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We discuss the successes, challenges, and future strategies. Secondary literature search was performed using Pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov and non-proprietary internet search engines. EXPERT OPINION: The use of BsAb constructs to target hematologic malignancies has achieved limited success to date. There continues to be a high level of enthusiasm for developing and applying new constructs to overcome the challenges in engineering and clinical application for hematologic malignancies.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*Bispecific', '*Multiple myeloma', '*NHL', '*antibody', '*hematologic', '*malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 12.,"BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex process in bone development. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism study of insulin in promoting wound healing. METHODS: Firstly, the acute human monocyte leukemia cell lines were induced to differentiate into macrophages. Secondly, the porphyromonas gingivalis was applied to mix with the differentiated macrophages. Thirdly, the effect of different concentrations of insulin (0 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, and 1,000 ng/mL) on the phagocytosis of macrophages and production of reactive oxygen species was investigated. Depending on these experiments, the optimal insulin concentration was used to treat the macrophages at different time points (0 hours and 0.5 hours) to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs. Finally, functional analysis including gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was carried out to explore the biological function of these differentially expressed mRNAs. RESULTS: The test of phagocytosis function and production of reactive oxygen species showed that 200 ng/mL insulin treatment had a significant influence on antibacterial and production of reactive oxygen species. In RNA sequencing, a total of 415 (245 upregulated and 170 downregulated) differentially expressed mRNAs were identified between different time points. Two important signaling pathways including endocytosis and systemic lupus erythematosus were found in the KEGG enrichment analysis. In the PPI network, several hub proteins encoded by differentially expressed mRNA including ALB, HIP1R, RAB5A, HIST1H2BJ, HIST1H3G, and HIST1H2BO were identified. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated that several differentially expressed mRNAs, such as EGR1, RAB34, ALB, HIP1R, RAB5A, HIST1H2BJ, HIST1H3G, and HIST1H2BO and two important signaling pathways including endocytosis and systemic lupus erythematosus may play important roles in the bone wound healing.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*insulin', '*phagocytosis', '*wound healing']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3608-3157'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 12.,"A variety of epigenetic factors involved in leukemia pathogenesis. Among various epigenetic factors, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important players, which affect a sequence of cellular and molecular signaling pathways. Leukemia is known as progressive cancer, which is related to many health problems in the world. It has been shown that the destruction of the blood-forming organs could lead to abnormal effects on the proliferation and development of leukocytes and their precursors. Despite many attempts for approved effective and powerful therapies for patients with leukemia, finding and developing new therapeutic approaches are required. One of the important aspects of leukemia therapy, identification of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of leukemia. Several miRNAs (ie, miR-103, miR-101, mit-7, let-7i, miR-424, miR-27a, and miR-29c) and play major roles in response to therapy in patients with leukemia. miRNAs exert their effects by targeting a variety of targets, which are associated with response to therapy in patients with leukemia. It seems that more understanding about the roles of miRNAs in response to therapy in patients with leukemia could contribute to better treatment of patients with leukemia. Here, for the first time, we summarized various miRNAs, which are involved in response to therapy in the treatment patients with leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*microRNA (miRNA)', '*therapy']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2194-0515'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A kidney biopsy is usually required to detect the renal lesions that are often missed using other diagnostic tools. Methods: We retrospectively identified 34 patients with renal lymphoma diagnosed by percutaneous kidney biopsy (PKB) at Rennes University Hospital and its affiliated hospital centers between January 1, 2004, and May 1, 2016. Clinical, biological, radiological, and histological characteristics were collected at biopsy time. Results: The included patients had Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (n = 12; 35.3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 10; 29.5%), high-grade B-cell lymphoma (n = 6; 17.6%), and low-grade B-cell lymphoma (n = 6; 17.6%). The median follow-up was 29 months. Renal involvement led to renal function impairment in 29 patients (85.3%), among whom 20 had acute kidney injury (70%), and to nephrotic syndrome in 4 patients (11.8%). Only 13 patients (38.2%) presented morphological kidney anomalies among whom 5 showed bilateral infiltration. Histologically, interstitial infiltrate (97.1%) was the most common kidney lesion, and 9 patients (26.5%) had specific lymphomatous intraglomerular lesions. After hematological treatment (n = 29), a renal response was observed only in 8 patients (27.6%). Conclusion: Renal involvement in the context of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is not uncommon. PKB is the best method to confirm this diagnosis. It should be performed early to rapidly initiate the hematological treatment to preserve kidney function.",,PMC6506703,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'kidney biopsy', 'renal lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two viral proteins, Tax-1 and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), play important roles in the pathogenesis of both diseases. We recently demonstrated that HBZ, previously considered a nuclear protein, is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HAM/TSP patients. Here, the analysis of a larger panel of HAM/TSP cases confirmed that HBZ is a cytoplasmic protein, while Tax-1 preferentially localized in the cytoplasm with fewer speckle-like dots in the nucleus. More importantly, here we report for the first time that HBZ, when expressed in asymptomatic carriers (AC), is also confined in the cytoplasm. Similarly, Tax-1 was preferentially expressed in the cytoplasm in a significant proportion of AC. Interestingly, in both HAM/TSP and AC patients, the expression of HBZ and Tax-1 was rarely found in the same cell. We observed only few cases coexpressing the two oncoprotein in a very limited number of cells. In representative AC and HAM/TSP patients, cells expressing cytoplasmic HBZ were almost exclusively found in the CD4+ T cell compartment and very rarely in CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, at least in the cases analyzed, the expression of thymocite-expressed molecule involved in selection (THEMIS) is dispensable for the cytoplasmic localization of HBZ in both AC and HAM/TSP. The study of an HTLV-1-immortalized cell line established from an HAM/TSP patient confirmed HBZ as a resident cytoplasmic protein not shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus. These results extend our previous observation on the dichotomy of HBZ localization between HAM/TSP and ATL, pointing to the exclusive either cytoplasmic or nuclear localization in the two diseased states, respectively. Moreover, they show a rather selective expression in distinct cells of either HBZ or Tax-1. The unprecedented observation that HBZ is expressed only in the cytoplasm in AC strongly suggests a progressive modification of HBZ localization during the disease states associated to HTLV-1 infection. Future studies will clarify whether the distinct HBZ intracellular localization is a marker or a causative event of disease evolution.",,PMC6497793,,['NOTNLM'],"['HAM/TSP', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax-1', 'asymptomatic carriers']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariable analyses revealed that miR-25 upregulation is an independent predictor for extended OS (HR = 0.556, P = 0.015) and EFS (HR = 0.598, P = 0.03). In addition, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) circumvented the poor prognosis that was related to miR-25 downregulation with chemotherapy. The expression level pattern of miR-25 coincided with AML differentiation and proliferation, which included HOXA and HOXB cluster members, as well as the HOX cofactor MEIS1. The MYH9 gene was identified as a direct target of miR-25. Conclusions: The miR-25 levels are correlated with prognosis in AML independently of other powerful molecular markers. The expression of miR-25 may contribute to the selection of the optimal treatment regimen between chemotherapy and allo-HCST for AML patients.",,PMC6505210,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allo-HSCT', 'Chemotherapy', 'Clinical outcome', 'miR-25']",,,"['All data sets were derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal and', 'are publicly accessible from the TCGA website.

Epub 2019 May 10.,"OBJECTIVES: We determined whether cytokines are a potential target to improve cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and quality of life (QOL) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: 219 patients age 18+ undergoing intensive chemotherapy for AML were assessed at up to 4 time points (pre-treatment, 1month, 6months, 12months). CRF and QOL were assessed with validated patient-reported outcome measures with minimum clinically important differences (MCID) of 4 and 10 points, respectively. A panel of 31 plasma cytokines was measured. CRF and QOL were regressed against scaled cytokine values, adjusting for age, gender, time, remission status, and hemoglobin in linear models. RESULTS: 498 cytokine samples were available. For CRF, the model R(2) was 25.3%, with cytokines explaining 6.9% of the variance. For QOL, corresponding values were 27.9% and 7.4%, respectively. A shift from the 30th to 70th centile distribution of all cytokines was associated with an improvement in CRF by 5.2 points and a 10.2-point improvement in QOL. A shift from 5th to 95th centile in TNF-alpha but no other single cytokine was associated with a change of >MCID in CRF, but there was no similar association with QOL. Cytokines had greater explanatory power for CRF in older versus younger adults and the most influential cytokines differed by age, particularly TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: Cytokines explain a relatively small amount of CRF and QOL scores in patients with AML and effects differ by age group. For cytokine-targeted therapies to improve either outcome, multiple cytokines may need to be substantially altered and therapeutic targets may vary with age.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Aging', '*Cancer-related fatigue', '*Cytokines', '*Interleukin', '*Quality of life', '*Tumor necrosis factor']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 4.,"B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus region 1 (BMI1) is a central component of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which maintains epigenetic repression of genes expression via chromatin condensation. BMI1 overexpression downregulates the expression of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16Ink4a and PTEN. BMI1 expression is upregulated in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Therefore, inhibitors of BMI1 expression have potential as therapeutic agents for cancer. This study aimed to identify BMI1 promoter inhibitors from actinomycetes. Using a recently constructed BMI1 promoter assay, we isolated three known compounds, elaiophylin (1), 2-methylelaiophylin (2), and nocardamin (3), from Streptomyces sp. IFM-11958 that inhibited BMI1 promoter activity with IC50 values of 30nM, 447nM, 22microM, respectively. Elaiophylin (1) was the most potent. Western blot and PCR analyses revealed that elaiophylin (1) inhibited BMI1 expression at the mRNA level in human prostate cancer cells (DU145). Elaiophylin (1) also inhibited the sphere-forming activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh7), indicating that elaiophylin (1) suppresses the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Elaiophylin (1) is the first BMI1 promoter inhibitor isolated from actinomycete metabolites.",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of BLV-infected cattle remain asymptomatic throughout their productive lives, whereas approximately 5%-10% of infected cattle develop EBL. Data accumulated recently indicate that whole blood proviral load (PVL) levels of BLV-infected cattle could be an indicator of disease progression in the field. However, a few cross-sectional studies have been reported. Here, we prospectively evaluated 866 cattle enrolled between August 2015 and December 2015, and followed until November 2018, identifying 407 asymptomatic BLV-infected cattle. There were no significant differences in the median PVL level among the category of herd seroprevalence (p = 0.57), herd size (p = 0.19), nor among the category of past EBL history in the herd (p = 0.31). During the study period, 12 cattle developed EBL. The PVL levels of EBL cattle at the time of enrollment were significantly higher than that of cattle that did not progress to EBL (median, 90,695 vs 39,139 copies/10(5) cells, p = 0.0005). Moreover, the adjusted hazard ratio for the increase in PVL was 2.61 (95% CI, 1.51-4.53) as estimated by the Cox proportional hazards frailty model. These results indicate that a high PVL level is a significant risk factor for progression to EBL, and could potentially be used as an indicator for the identification of cattle to be culled from the herd long before the progression of EBL. This knowledge might be useful to design a strategy for decreasing economic loss from EBL or even eradicating it from herds.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Enzootic bovine leukosis', 'Prospective study', 'Proviral load']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among the 203 CML female patients, there were ten pregnancies in seven women, all of them not planned. In three cases, the chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis was made during pregnancy. Five patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the first weeks of pregnancy and the drug was interrupted until delivery. One patient lost complete cytogenetic response, and two patients lost the hematological response. A patient with a stable major molecular response had two successful pregnancies without loss of response. There were four premature births. There were no maternal adverse events, fetal malformation or death. All patients received Interferon-alpha during gestation, and two received hydroxyurea for a short period.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 55 patients with Chronic myeloid leukemia. The eligibility criteria were based on the availability of hematological and clinical baseline data in the medical records. Data on BCR-ABL transcripts were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (36%) had the b2a2 transcript, 24 (48%) had b3a2 and 8 (16%) had b2a2/b3a2. The median platelet count for transcripts b2a2, b3a2 and b2a2/b3a2 was 320.65x10(3)/L, 396x10(3)/L, and 327.05x10(3)/L, respectively (p=0.896). We could not find any differences in relation to the other hematological parameters, when compared to the transcript type. Comparison between spleen and liver size and type of transcript did not differ inside the groups (p=0.395 and p=0.647, respectively) and the association between risk scores and transcript type did not show statistical significance (p>0.05). The 21-month probability for event-free survival was 21%, 48% and 66% for the transcripts b2a2, b3a2 and b2a2/b3a2 respectively (p=0.226) CONCLUSION: We conclude that the expression BCR-ABL transcripts have no influence on hematological, clinical and event-free survival parameters of patients in the Chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase.",,PMC6517615,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

However, patient adherence has a great impact on the response obtained with medical treatment. This study's objective was to analyze the drug adherence and the factors that influenced it in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in a referral hospital in the Brazilian Amazon. METHOD: This was a retrospective study including 120 patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia from January 2002 to December 2014. The adherence was estimated by the Proportion of Days Covered and the persistence by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The data was analyzed in Epi Info 7((R)) software and the relationship between the variables was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (22.5%) were considered non-adherent. There has been irregular medication use and disinterest in the treatment in 20.83% (n=25), of which 13 were considered non-adherent (p<0.001). A total of 26.67% (n=32) abandoned the treatment for a period. Of those, 56.25% (n=18) were non-adherent (p<0.001). Distance to the hospital, lack of medication and side-effects were all non-significant to low adherence. At the end of a 360-day follow-up, 44.16% (n=53) of patients presented a break in persistence, whose average was 255 days. CONCLUSION: The adherence found in this study was similar to that found in others of its kind. The only factors that negatively influenced the adherence were disinterest and abandonment of treatment, which can reflect the need to individually educate Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patients.",,PMC6517621,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence', 'Amazon', 'Chronic', 'Imatinib', 'Leukemia', 'Myelogenous']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Epub 2019 May 12.,"Both nilotinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and ponatinib, a third-generation TKI used in CML and Philadelphia positive acute lymphocytic leukaemia, have been associated with an increase in arterial occlusive events, in contrast to other TKIs such as imatinib and dasatinib. We have previously demonstrated evidence of a pro-thrombotic state associated with nilotinib, using microvascular and arterial thrombosis C57BL/6 mouse models. In this study, we examined ponatinib and determined if a calcium channel blocker could ameliorate the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotypes. In vitro treatment of whole human or murine blood with ponatinib and nilotinib increased platelet activation, adhesion and three-dimensional thrombi over time compared with vehicle control or other TKIs. Treatment of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with ponatinib and nilotinib but not imatinib, dasatinib or vehicle control for 4 hours significantly increased thrombus growth following ex vivo perfusion on collagen and FeCl3-induced vascular injury of mesenteric arterioles and carotid artery in vivo and increased plasma levels of soluble P-selectin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). Ponatinib-treated CML patients had increased ex vivo thrombus formation and a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared with healthy controls. Pre-treatment of mice with the calcium channel antagonist, diltiazem, prior to ponatinib or nilotinib reversed the pro-thrombotic phenotype and the increase in cytokine levels. These observations suggest that the pro-thrombotic effect of nilotinib and ponatinib is partially related to calcium channel activation and TxA2 generation and this should be explored clinically as a mechanism to prevent vascular events.",,,,,,,['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Others received accelerated approval based on surrogate endpoints in early phase trials. All, however, carry significant costs and toxicities. Cost-effectiveness analyses are so far only available for midostaurin, CPX-351, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Recently approved drugs for AML have varying levels of evidence for clinical effectiveness and because of associated high costs may further increase the overall economic burden of AML care. This issue is complex and whether novel AML drugs will cost-effective will depend on multiple factors, including their ability to improve survival and quality of life while simultaneously reducing the costs of healthcare resource utilization.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Clinical benefit', '*Cost-benefit', '*Health economics', '*Novel therapeutics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our analysis was to report, after a median follow-up of 10.2 years (range 5.8-14.8), the long-term outcome, efficacy, and safety of imatinib treatment (frontline and after interferon failure) in a single institution cohort of 459 patients with CML in chronic phase treated outside of clinical trials. The 10-year overall survival of the whole cohort was 77.1%, while the 10-year probability of dying due to CML and other causes was 7.8% and 16%, respectively. The prognostic value of the BCR-ABL1 ratio at 3 months ( 10%) and of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response at 1 year was confirmed also in the real-life practice. The EUTOS long-term survival score better stratified the baseline risk of dying of CML compared with other risk scores. Two hundred thirty-six (51.4%) patients achieved a deep molecular response during imatinib treatment after a median time of 4.57 years, and 95 (20.6%) had a stable deep molecular response maintained for at least 2 consecutive years. Imatinib was associated with a low rate of serious cardiovascular events and second neoplasia. This 10-year real-life follow-up study shows that imatinib maintains efficacy over time and that long-term administration of imatinib is not associated with notable cumulative or late toxic effects.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Long-term follow-up', 'Real-life experience']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6391-4406'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 8.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has evolved over the past five decades, with moderation of traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the introduction of targeted immune-based and cellular-based therapies. The affect of these changes on late health outcomes has not been assessed. Using data from the The St Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) Cohort, we aimed to characterise the magnitude of morbidity and patterns of late health outcomes among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated over time. METHODS: The St Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) Cohort is a retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up and ongoing data accrual designed to facilitate longitudinal, clinically-based assessment of health outcomes among survivors of paediatric malignancies. 980 survivors included in this analysis were diagnosed with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) between Aug 28, 1963, and July 19, 2003, were aged 18 years old and older at enrolment, had a minimum follow-up of 10 years after diagnosis, and completed an initial on-campus SJLIFE assessment as of data cutoff (June 30, 2015). 272 community control participants, matched to survivors on 5-year age blocks in each sex, were recruited for comparison. Cumulative chemotherapy and radiation dose exposures and major medical events during and after therapy were retrieved from the medical records of the survivors. History or physical examination, laboratory analysis, physical fitness, and neurocognitive testing were done. Health conditions were graded according to a modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Neurocognitive domains of attention (Trial Making Test Part A and Conner's Continuous Performance Test-II) and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Digit Span Test Backward) were measured and age-adjusted Z scores were calculated. Mean cumulative count was used to calculate the age-standardised cumulative burden of health conditions over time. This cohort study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00760656. FINDINGS: 980 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (50% women, median age at diagnosis 5 years [IQR 3.1-9.1 years], and median time from diagnosis of 30.0 years [22.7-36.3]) had a median age of 35.8 years (29.4-42.9) at assessment compared with 35.1 years (28.7-42.6) for 272 controls. Survivors had significantly more growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, and neuropathy than controls. By age 30 years, survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had, on average, 5.4 (95% CI 5.1-5.8) grade 1-4 health conditions, including 3.2 (2.9-3.4) grade 2-4 health conditions, compared with 2.0 (CI 1.7-2.2) grade 1-4 and 1.2 (1.03-1.4) grade 2-4 health conditions among controls. The cumulative burden of grade 2-4 health conditions involved multiple organ systems for survivors treated on protocols between 1962-91, but after elimination of cranial radiotherapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, conditions now predominately include musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders for survivors on protocols between 1991-2007. INTERPRETATION: Although changes in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment protocols have improved overall survival, the burden of late morbidity remains high for these patients. We show that the pattern of late toxic effects has markedly changed over time, with survivors having a reduction in health conditions that are immediately life-threatening, however, maintaining health status and quality of life for survivors of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia requires continued medical surveillance, counselling, and lifestyle modifications.

To retrospectively identify and study these new molecularly defined WHO(2016/2017)entities, we reviewed clinicopathologic data and pretherapy archived pathologic materials at diagnosis for 143 consecutive AML cases (55.2% male, median age 62 [range 18-89] years) and classified all cases by the 2008 WHO (WHO(2008)) and revised WHO(2016/2017) criteria. By WHO(2008), cases included 21 (15%) with recurrent genetic abnormalities (52.3% male, median age 54 [range 18-82] years), 54 (38%) with myelodysplasia-related changes (57.4% male, median age 65 [range 32-84] years), 3 (2%) therapy related (100% male, median age 66 [range 32-84] years), and 65 (45%) not otherwise specified (52.3% male, median age 61 [range 19-89] years). Twenty-two (15.4%) cases (21 AML, not otherwise specified; 1 AML with myelodysplasia-related changes by WHO(2008)) reclassified by WHO(2016/2017) as AML-NPM1(mut) showed female predominance (54.5%), and median (range) values were as follows: age 60.5 (23-84) years, hemoglobin 8.6 (5.6-12.9) g/dL, total leucocytes 30.1 (2.58-241.84) x 10(9)/L, monocytes 1.65 (0-49.34) x 10(9)/L, neutrophils 1.96 (0-29.79) x 10(9)/L, platelets 55 (11-320) x 10(9)/L, blasts (peripheral blood 41% [2%-98%], bone marrow 66% [17%-97%]), with myeloblasts(CD34neg) (17 [77%]/21), cytogenetics(normal) (20 [91%]/22), FLT3-ITD(pos) (9 [41%]/22), FLT3-ITD(neg)FLT3-TKD(pos) (5 [23%]/22), FLT3-ITD(neg)FLT3-TKD(neg) (8 [36%]/22), and extramedullary involvement (6 [27%]/22), including 1 novel cutaneous presentation. Notably, presenting features among AML-NPM1(mut) included those of anemia (22 [100%]) and thrombocytopenia (20 [91%]/22). This is also the first report of 4 [18%]/22 AML-NPM1(mut) (including 3 [75%]/4 nonsmokers) with a family history of leukemia and one 74-year-old with familial AML-biCEBPA(mut). This study validates the application of the WHO(2016/2017) classification criteria by retrospectively identifying AML-NPM1(mut) and AML-biCEBPA(mut) cases using single-gene molecular analyses.

Epub 2019 May 11.,"BACKGROUND: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and hairy cell leukemia variant (HCLv) are rare diseases with overlapping clinicopathological features. Features distinguishing HCL from HCLv include expression of CD25, CD123, CD200, annexin-A1, and the presence of BRAF V600E mutation. HCLv typically lacks these markers, but they may occur in a subgroup of HCL patients with an aggressive clinical course. We examined CD43, CD81, CD79b, and CD200 expression in HCL and HCLv. METHODS: Multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) was performed on blood from 59 HCL and 15 HCLv patients for protocol entry. Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD43, CD79b, CD81, and CD200 was determined (for CD200, n = 17 and 7, respectively). RESULTS: Median MFI of HCL vs HCLv was 545 vs 272 for CD43, 602 vs 2,450 for CD81, 4,962 vs 1,969 for CD79b, and 11,652 vs 1,405 for CD200, respectively. Analysis of the median differences, HCL minus HCLv (and their 95% confidence intervals and P-values) indicated that CD43 MFI (estimated median difference (95% CI): 212 [72-413; P = 0.0027) and CD200 MFI (9,883 [3,514-13,434]; P < 0.0001) were higher in HCL than in HCLv, while CD81 MFI (-1,858 [-2,604 to -1,365]; P < 0.0001) was lower in HCL than in HCLv. CD79b MFI HCL median was more than double that of HCLv, but the observed difference (1,571 [-739 to 4,417]) was consistent with the null hypothesis of no difference (P = 0.13).

We and others have previously shown that reduced hnRNP K expression downmodulates tumor-suppressive programs. However, overexpression of hnRNP K is the more commonly observed clinical phenomenon, yet its functional consequences and clinical significance remain unknown. METHODS: Clinical implications of hnRNP K overexpression were examined through immunohistochemistry on samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who did not harbor MYC alterations (n = 75). A novel transgenic mouse model that overexpresses hnRNP K specifically in B cells was generated to directly examine the role of hnRNP K overexpression in mice (three transgenic lines). Molecular consequences of hnRNP K overexpression were determined through proteomics, formaldehyde-RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing, and biochemical assays. Therapeutic response to BET-bromodomain inhibition in the context of hnRNP K overexpression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo (n = 3 per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: hnRNP K is overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients without MYC genomic alterations. This overexpression is associated with dismal overall survival and progression-free survival (P < .001). Overexpression of hnRNP K in transgenic mice resulted in the development of lymphomas and reduced survival (P < .001 for all transgenic lines; Line 171[n = 30]: hazard ratio [HR] = 64.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 26.1 to 158.0; Line 173 [n = 31]: HR = 25.27, 95% CI = 10.3 to 62.1; Line 177 [n = 25]: HR = 119.5, 95% CI = 42.7 to 334.2, compared with wild-type mice). Clinical samples, mouse models, global screening assays, and biochemical studies revealed that hnRNP K's oncogenic potential stems from its ability to posttranscriptionally and translationally regulate MYC. Consequently, Hnrnpk overexpression renders cells sensitive to BET-bromodomain-inhibition in both in vitro and transplantation models, which represents a strategy for mitigating hnRNP K-mediated c-Myc activation in patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that hnRNP K is a bona fide oncogene when overexpressed and represents a novel mechanism for c-Myc activation in the absence of MYC lesions.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7489062,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, ATP citrate-lyase (ACLY) expression was demonstrated as an independent predictor of clinical outcome in solid tumors. However, no systematic study was conducted to explore the prognostic impact of ACLY on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: To assess the prognostic value of ACLY transcript, we conducted a study with a discovery and validation design. We measured ACLY transcript by real-time quantitative PCR in 274 AML patients, and validated the prognostic value in the two independent cohorts using published data. Meta-analysis of gene-expression profile and inhibition ACLY expression in leukemia cell lines were conducted to help us understand the biological insight of low ACLY expression. RESULTS: Low ACLY expression is less common amongst AMLs with DNMT3A mutations, but coexisted in double allele CEBPA mutations. Moreover, low ACLY expression is associated with favorable overall survival in AML patients and is involved in multiple pathways. These results are also validated in two independent cohorts of AML patients. Moreover, ACLY silencing induces proliferation arrest in THP-1 and MOLM-13 leukemia cell lines.

Epub 2019 May 10.,"BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most lethal malignancy in thyroid carcinomas. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a member of non-coding RNAs, regulating the expression of gene. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is an onco-lncRNA that is overexpressed in several carcinomas including ATC. Evidence showed that MALAT1 has a crucial function in apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. OBJECTIVES: In order to take advantage of 3D cell culture system in cancer investigation, we have used a 3D in vitro ATC model to determine the effect of dual MEK/Aurora kinase inhibitor BI-847325 anticancer drug on the fundamental molecular mechanisms of MALAT1-mediated gene regulation in ATC. METHODS: In this study, ATC cell lines (C643 and SW1736) were grown in alginate scaffold. Encapsulated cells were treated by BI-847325. Changes in expression of MALAT1, Mcl1, miR-363-3p, and cyclinD1 were measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: MALAT1 gene expression following BI-847325 treatment was significantly downregulated in C643 and SW1736 cell lines. Reversely, miR-363-3p expression was significantly upregulated by BI-847325 in both ATC cell lines. Mcl1 expression was significantly downregulated after treatment in C643 cell lines. Moreover, the expression of this gene was not significantly reduced following BI-847325 treatment in SW1736 cell line. Additionally, cyclin D1 expression was significantly downregulated after treatment in both ATC cell lines. Altogether, the result of this study was the first report of MALAT1's molecular function in ATC and suggested that BI-847325 which inhibits both MEK and Aurora kinase family could be effective against ATC by regulating the genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis including MALAT1and its downstream genes. Graphical abstract Schematic representation of the biological role of MALAT1 in cyclin D1, miR-363-3p and Mcl1 gene regulations. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) by growth factors (GFs) phosphorylates RAS that subsequently activates RAF. Then, RAF phosphorylates MEK. Consequently, activated MEK phosphorylates ERK downstream effector, leading to the MALAT1 gene expression. MALAT1 is a negative regulator of Mcl1 mRNA by sponging of miR-363-3p. In addition, MALAT1 leads to Axin1 and APC downregulation and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activation. Stable beta-catenin translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression.",,PMC6592994,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer', 'BI-847325', 'Cyclin D1', 'MALAT1', 'Mcl1', 'miR-363-3p']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been shown that the homogeneity of the chromatin landscape between CLL cells contrasts with the important observed genetic heterogeneity of the disease. To gain further insight into the consequences of disease evolution on the epigenome's plasticity, we monitored changes in chromatin structure occurring in vivo in CLL cells from patients receiving continuous Ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proved to be remarkably efficient against treatment naive (TN), heavily pre-treated and high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), with limited adverse events. We established that the chromatin landscape is significantly and globally affected in response to Ibrutinib. However, we observed that prior to treatment, CLL cells show qualitative and quantitative variations in chromatin structure correlated with both EZH2 protein level and cellular response to external stimuli. Then, under prolonged exposure to Ibrutinib, a loss of the two marks associated with lysine 27 (acetylation and trimethylation) was observed. Altogether, these data indicate that the epigenome of CLL cells from the peripheral blood change dynamically in response to stimuli and suggest that these cells might adapt to the Ibrutinib ""hit"" in a process leading toward a possible reduced sensitivity to treatment.","['MR/L01629X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '14016/Bloodwise']",PMC6510766,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0798-9790', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3951-3546']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 10.,"Disruption of epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but epigenetic therapy is complicated by the complexity of the epigenome. Herein, we developed a long-term primary AML ex vivo platform to determine whether targeting different epigenetic layers with 5-azacytidine and LSD1 inhibitors would yield improved efficacy. This combination was most effective in TET2 (mut) AML, where it extinguished leukemia stem cells and particularly induced genes with both LSD1-bound enhancers and cytosine-methylated promoters. Functional studies indicated that derepression of genes such as GATA2 contributes to drug efficacy. Mechanistically, combination therapy increased enhancer-promoter looping and chromatin-activating marks at the GATA2 locus. CRISPRi of the LSD1-bound enhancer in patient-derived TET2 (mut) AML was associated with dampening of therapeutic GATA2 induction. TET2 knockdown in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells induced loss of enhancer 5-hydroxymethylation and facilitated LSD1-mediated enhancer inactivation. Our data provide a basis for rational targeting of cooperating aberrant promoter and enhancer epigenetic marks driven by mutant epigenetic modifiers. SIGNIFICANCE: Somatic mutations of genes encoding epigenetic modifiers are a hallmark of AML and potentially disrupt many components of the epigenome. Our study targets two different epigenetic layers at promoters and enhancers that cooperate to aberrant gene silencing, downstream of the actions of a mutant epigenetic regulator.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.","['R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA220499/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA169055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6606333,['NIHMS1529258'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9415-1659', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0663-6216', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8409-3037', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8723-3389', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8162-6758']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 10.,"Before the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lineage-restricted progenitors, such as erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs), are detected in the embryo or in pluripotent stem cell cultures in vitro. Although both HSCs and EMPs are derived from hemogenic endothelium, it remains unclear how and when these two developmental programs are segregated during ontogeny. Here, we show that hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf) expression specifically marks a developmental continuum between HSC precursors and HSCs. Using the Hlf-tdTomato reporter mouse, we found that Hlf is expressed in intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters and fetal liver HSCs. In contrast, EMPs and yolk sac hematopoietic clusters before embryonic day 9.5 do not express Hlf HSC specification, regulated by the Evi-1/Hlf axis, is activated only within Hlf(+) nascent hematopoietic clusters. These results strongly suggest that HSCs and EMPs are generated from distinct cohorts of hemogenic endothelium. Selective induction of the Hlf(+) lineage pathway may lead to the in vitro generation of HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.","['P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6605751,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6157-2852', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6377-0174', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0423-9003', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7202-3741', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6423-3888', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3982-9054', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7540-1771']",['(c) 2019 Yokomizo et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 10.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acquired T-cell dysfunction impedes development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies, through as-yet unresolved mechanisms. We have previously shown that CD8(+) T cells in CLL exhibit impaired activation and reduced glucose uptake after stimulation. CD8(+) T cells in CLL patients are chronically exposed to leukemic B cells, which potentially impacts metabolic homeostasis resulting in aberrant metabolic reprogramming upon stimulation. Here, we report that resting CD8(+) T cells in CLL have reduced intracellular glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) reserves, and have an altered mitochondrial metabolic profile as displayed by increased mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and levels of reactive oxygen species. This coincided with decreased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, and in line with that, CLL-derived CD8(+) T cells showed impaired mitochondrial biogenesis upon stimulation. In search of a therapeutic correlate of these findings, we analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CD8(+) T cells prior to infusion in CLL patients (who were enrolled in NCT01747486 and NCT01029366 [https://clinicaltrials.gov]). Interestingly, in cases with a subsequent complete response, the infused CD8(+) CAR T cells had increased mitochondrial mass compared with nonresponders, which positively correlated with the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells. Our findings demonstrate that GLUT1 reserves and mitochondrial fitness of CD8(+) T cells are impaired in CLL. Therefore, boosting mitochondrial biogenesis in CAR T cells might improve the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy and other emerging cellular immunotherapies.","['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA226983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7022375,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3253-8759', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1521-6213', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01747486', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01029366']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 10.,"FLT3, DNMT3A, and NPM1 are the most frequently mutated genes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but little is known about how these mutations synergize upon cooccurrence. Here we show that triple-mutated AML is characterized by high leukemia stem cell (LSC) frequency, an aberrant leukemia-specific GPR56 (high)CD34(low) immunophenotype, and synergistic upregulation of Hepatic Leukemia Factor (HLF). Cell sorting based on the LSC marker GPR56 allowed isolation of triple-mutated from DNMT3A/NPM1 double-mutated subclones. Moreover, in DNMT3A R882-mutated patients, CpG hypomethylation at the HLF transcription start site correlated with high HLF mRNA expression, which was itself associated with poor survival. Loss of HLF via CRISPR/Cas9 significantly reduced the CD34(+)GPR56(+) LSC compartment of primary human triple-mutated AML cells in serial xenotransplantation assays. HLF knockout cells were more actively cycling when freshly harvested from mice, but rapidly exhausted when reintroduced in culture. RNA sequencing of primary human triple-mutated AML cells after shRNA-mediated HLF knockdown revealed the NOTCH target Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1C/p57 as novel targets of HLF, potentially mediating these effects. Overall, our data establish HLF as a novel LSC regulator in this genetically defined high-risk AML subgroup.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3719-4342', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0289-6889', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5477-1386', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9829-2600', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7166-5232', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5081-7869', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1956-2778', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1773-7677', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6452-8814', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8324-4040', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9716-5909']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Jul 18;134(3):222-224.

Epub 2019 May 10.,"The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B is one of the critical downstream targets of TAL1, which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the noncoding RNA, ARID5B-inducing enhancer associated long noncoding RNA (ARIEL), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that ARIEL is specifically activated in TAL1 (+) T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with ARID5B enhancer activity. ARIEL recruits mediator proteins to the ARID5B enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of ARID5B, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the MYC oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of ARIEL Knockdown of ARIEL inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that ARIEL plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.","['P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8212351,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7483-3668', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8338-9554', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6454-976X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1621-4954']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Jul 18;134(3):219-221.

Oral lenalidomide 10 mg was administered daily starting on day 9 of cycle 1. IV rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered weekly during cycle 1 and every 4 weeks for cycles 3 to 12. Sequencing of a custom panel of 295 genes was performed in pretreatment bone marrow samples. The study included 61 patients with TN CLL and 59 with R CLL; the overall response rate (ORR) was 73% and 64%, respectively. A baseline beta2-microglobulin level <4 mg/L was associated with higher ORR in both groups (both, P = .03), and absence of mutations in the NOTCH signaling pathway showed a trend for association with higher ORR in R CLL (P = .10). Median PFS was 50 months in TN patients and 28 months in R patients. On multivariate analysis, age >/=65 years (P = .02) was associated with shorter PFS in TN patients, whereas according to univariate analysis, >2 previous therapies (P = .02) was the only factor associated with shorter PFS in R patients. A trend for association between mutations in the NOTCH pathway and shorter PFS was observed in TN CLL (P = .15).

We have shown previously that JMJD1C is required for self-renewal of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leukemia stem cells (LSCs) but not normal hematopoietic stem cells. However, the domains within JMJD1C that promote LSC self-renewal are unknown. Here, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) negative-selection screening and identified a requirement for the catalytic Jumonji (JmjC) domain and zinc finger domain for leukemia cell survival in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) is a marker for JMJD1C activity at gene loci. Moreover, we performed single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse leukemia cells harboring a single guide RNA (sgRNA) against the JmjC domain and identified increased activation of RAS/MAPK and the JAK-STAT pathway in cells harboring the JmjC sgRNA. We discovered that upregulation of interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor genes mediates increased activation of IL-3 signaling upon JMJD1C loss or mutation. Along these lines, we observed resistance to JMJD1C loss in MLLr AML bearing activating RAS mutations, suggesting that RAS pathway activation confers resistance to JMJD1C loss. Overall, we discovered the functional importance of the JMJD1C JmjC domain in AML leukemogenesis and a novel interplay between JMJD1C and the IL-3 signaling pathway as a potential resistance mechanism to targeting JMJD1C catalytic activity.","['R00 CA168996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI079087/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL130724/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6517669,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1947-5386', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0418-652X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2688-9541', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8568-1295']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Mar 25.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with acute B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) show as refractory or relapsed, which is one of the major causes of death in patients with B-ALL, but the methods of the treatment for relapsed/refractory B-ALL (R/R B-ALL) are limited. The chimeric antigen receptors redirected T cells (CAR-T cells) have showed a strong anti-leukemia role for B-ALL. About 90% of patients with R/R B-ALL treated with CD19-CAR-T cells achieved complete remission. However, 60% to 70% of patients relapsed after CAR-T cells treatment, which may be related to target antigen reduction or escape. New products are urgently needed to prevent and treat antigenic escapes causing recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this article, we retrospectively analyzed the immunophenotype of patients with B-ALL initially diagnosed in our center from January 2010 to December 2015 to determine whether aberrant antigen expression was associated with the prognosis of patients in order to find new targets for immunotherapy. RESULTS: The results show that disease-free and overall survival in patients without aberrant antigen expression were better than patients with aberrant antigen expression. The most common abnormal antigens were CD123, CD13, and CD56. Correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between aberrant CD123 expression and both disease-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Therefore, in the construction of CAR-T cells in patients with R/R B-ALL, conventional CD19 can be combined with aberrant antigens such as CD123 to form CARs with bi-specific antigens or multi-specific antigens may achieve the purpose of improving efficacy. However, more clinical trials are needed.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aberrant antigen', '*Acute B lymphocytic leukemia', '*CAR-T cells', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Prognostic value']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Clinical presentation: We present a male patient who presented peripheral blood leukocytosis. On the basis of his morphological appearances and molecular findings he was determined to have a diagnosis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia. At a follow-up at 7 months, in addition to the CSF3R c.2373G > A (p.W791*) truncated mutation, another CSF3R mutation appeared as c.1853C > T(p.T618I). Discussion and conclusion: We present the first patient with a diagnosis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia with a c.2373G > A (p.W791*) truncated mutation of CSF3R. These findings elucidate a novel paradigm of CNL pathogenesis and explain how mutations drive the development of the disease. The order of acquisition of CSF3R mutations relative to mutations in epigenetic modifiers and the spliceosome have been determined only in isolated case reports; thus, further work is needed to understand the impact of mutation chronology on the clonal evolution and progression of CNL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CSF3R', 'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia', 'disease progression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of (33S)-oligomycin A was determined by elemental analysis, spectroscopic studies, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Isomerization of C33 hydroxyl group led to minor changes in the potency against Aspergillus niger, Candida spp., and filamentous fungi whereas the activity against Streptomyces fradiae decreased by approximately 20-fold compared to oligomycin A. We observed that 33-epi-oligomycin A had the same activity on the human leukemia cell line K562 as oligomycin A but was more potent for the multidrug resistant subline K562/4.

Epub 2019 Jun 7.,"TAM family members (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) play essential roles in the resolution of inflammation and in infectious diseases and cancer. AXL, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is commonly overexpressed in several solid tumours and numerous hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma. AXL significantly promotes tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis, as well as angiogenesis. AXL also plays an important role in inflammation and macrophage ontogeny. Recent studies have revealed that AXL contributes to leukaemic phenotypes through activation of oncogenic signalling pathways that lead to increased cell migration and proliferation. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the role of AXL signalling in tumour metastasis, we screened a phage display library to generate a novel human monoclonal antibody, named DAXL-88, that recognizes both human and murine AXL. The concentrations of DAXL-88 required for 50% maximal binding to human and murine AXL were 0.118 and 0.164 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, DAXL-88 bound to human AXL with high affinity (KD ~ 370 pM). DAXL-88 blocked the interaction between AXL and its ligand, growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6), with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.16 mug/mL. Moreover, DAXL-88 inhibited AXL/GAS6-dependent cell signalling, which is implicated in cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, the novel anti-AXL DAXL-88 high-affinity antibody blocks the interaction between AXL and GAS6 and inhibits tumour cell migration and invasion induced by GAS6. Thus, DAXL-88 offers promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies in solid tumours, leukaemias and other lymphoid neoplasms.",['31771010/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL', 'DAXL-88', 'GAS6', 'invasion', 'migration', 'monoclonal antibody']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1572-002X'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The disease develops in people of all ages, but is more prominent in the elderly, who due to limited treatment options, have poor overall survival rates. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting specific cell surface molecules have proven to be safe and effective in different haematological malignancies. However, AML target molecules are currently limited so discovery of new targets would be highly beneficial to patients. We examined the C-type lectin receptor CD302 as a potential therapeutic target for AML due to its selective expression in myeloid immune populations. In a cohort of 33 AML patients with varied morphological and karyotypic classifications, 88% were found to express CD302 on the surface of blasts and 80% on the surface of CD34+ CD38- population enriched with leukemic stem cells. A mAb targeting human CD302 was effective in mediating antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and was internalised, making it amenable to toxin conjugation. Targeting CD302 with antibody limited in vivo engraftment of the leukemic cell line HL-60 in NOD/SCID mice. While CD302 was expressed in a hepatic cell line, HepG2, this molecule was not detected on the surface of HepG2, nor could HepG2 be killed using a CD302 antibody-drug conjugate. Expression was however found on the surface of haematopoietic stem cells suggesting that targeting CD302 would be most effective prior to haematopoietic transplantation. These studies provide the foundation for examining CD302 as a potential therapeutic target for AML.",,PMC6510432,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5074-8824', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7894-232X']",,"['GJC is a Director of DendroCyte which has intellectual property associated with', 'CD302 targeting of AML.

We report about two children with leukemia who underwent HSCT and later manifested aberrant fat distributions consistent with acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). Both patients manifested graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), suggesting that GVHD may trigger lipodystrophy. The patients exhibited diabetic blood glucose patterns in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with high homeostasis model assessment ratios (HOMA-Rs), hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and decreased serum leptin and adiponectin levels. Both patients were diagnosed with APL with metabolic disease. A review of the data of patients with ALD after HSCT revealed common clinical features, including aberrant fat distribution, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes and dyslipidemia. Based on previous reports and our two cases, we speculate that GVHD in the adipose tissue supports the development of ALD after HSCT. In conclusion, children may develop APL after HSCT.

Epub 2019 Jun 6.,"OBJECTIVES: As new, effective therapies emerge for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the results of clinical trials need to relate to standard of care. METHODS: We used the population-based Swedish ALL Registry to evaluate characteristics, treatment and long-term outcome in 933 patients with diagnosis between 1997 and 2015. RESULTS: The median age was 53 years. The frequency of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive leukaemia was 34% of examined B-ALL with a peak incidence at 50-59 years. Five-year overall survival (OS) improved between 1997-2006 and 2007-2015; in patients 18-45 years from 50% (95% CI 43-57) to 65% (95% CI 58-72), 46-65 years from 25% (95% CI 18-32) to 46% (95% CI 37-55) and >65 years from 7% (95% CI 2.6-11) to 11% (95% CI 5.9-16) (P < 0.05). Men with Ph-neg B-ALL 46-65 years had inferior OS compared with women (P < 0.01). Standardised mortality ratio was 5.7 (95% CI 5.0-6.3) for patients who survived 5 years from diagnosis. In multivariable analysis, Ph-positive disease was not associated with impaired prognosis but with lower risk of death in 2007-2015. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based cohort, OS has improved in adult ALL, especially for Ph-positive disease but for middle-aged men with Ph-negative B-ALL outcome was poor. Cure without late toxicity or relapse is still desired.","['Uppsala University and Uppsala County Council/Region agreement on medical', 'training and clinical research (ALF)', 'Lions Cancer Foundation Uppsala']",PMC6851994,,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia-positive', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'adult']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1737-5568', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0283-4418']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 30.,"Immune checkpoints, including PD-1/PD-L1, play an important role in immunosuppression in various malignancies. Elevated levels of soluble programmed death ligand 1 (sPD-L1) are associated with worse prognosis in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Herein, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between plasma sPD-L1 levels and clinical response in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients. A total of 37 PTCL patients and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Peripheral blood from patients was collected prior to systemic therapy. Plasma levels of sPD-L1 and IFN-gamma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical response for patients was evaluated. ONCOMINE database analyses showed that PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in PTCLs. The median sPD-L1 level was 0.729 ng/mL for 20 healthy volunteers and 1.696 ng/mL for 37 PTCL patients which was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers (0.000). The sPD-L1 level was positively correlated with IFN-gamma level (0.000, r = 0.849) and was also positively associated with clinical staging (0.045), LDH level (0.003), and beta2-MG level (0.045). Patients with high sPD-L1 level had lower overall response rate than those with low sPD-L1 level (88.9% vs 50.0%, 0.022) and tended to have poorer PFS and OS. PD-L1 expression in tissues matched very well with the sPD-L1 level in PTCL patients. In conclusion, PTCL patients had higher sPD-L1 level compared with healthy volunteers. High sPD-L1 level was correlated with worse clinical response, suggesting that sPD-L1 level was an underlying plasma biomarker to predict the prognosis for PTCL patients.","['15KG145/Key Research Projects of Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau', '2015KZ081/Key Research Projects of Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau', '2017ZX09304-021, 2018ZX09201015/National Key New Drug Creation Special Programs', '81770213/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2005DKA21300/National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform', '1504/Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital Foundation']",PMC6771895,,['NOTNLM'],"['IFN-gamma', 'PTCLs', 'clinical response', 'sPD-L1']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7663-2923'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 31.,"Objective: To develop an economic model to evaluate changes in healthcare costs driven by restricting usage of branded tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through substitution with generic imatinib among chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in a typical Oncology Care Model (OCM) practice, and examine the impact on Performance-Based Payment (PBP) eligibility. Methods: An Excel-based economic model of an OCM practice with 1,000 cancer patients during a 6-month episode of care was developed. Cancer types and proportions of patients treated in the practice were estimated from an OCM report. All-cause healthcare costs were obtained from published literature. It was assumed that if a practice restricts usage of branded TKIs for newly-diagnosed CML patients, 80% of the market share of branded imatinib and 50% of the market shares of 2(nd)-gen TKIs would shift to generic imatinib. Among established TKI-treated patients, it was assumed that 80% of the market share of branded imatinib and no patients treated with 2(nd)-gen TKIs would shift to the generic. Results: Four CML patients were estimated for a 1,000-cancer patient OCM practice with a total baseline healthcare cost of $51,345,812 during a 6-month episode. If the practice restricts usage of branded TKIs, the shift from 2(nd)-gen TKIs to generic imatinib would reduce costs by $12,970, while shifting from branded to generic imatinib lowers costs by $25,250 during a 6-month episode. Minimum reductions of $3,013,832 in a one-sided risk model and $2,372,010 in a two-sided risk model are required for PBP eligibility; the shift from 2(nd)-gen TKIs to generic imatinib would account for 0.4% and 0.5% of the savings required for a PBP, respectively. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that the potential cost reduction associated with restricting branded TKI usage among CML patients in an OCM setting will represent only a small proportion of the cost reduction needed for PBP eligibility.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'I10', 'I19', 'healthcare costs', 'oncology care model', 'performance-based payment', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of clinical manifestations as well as imaging, pathology, CSF, and blood biomarkers on 43 subjects ages 1 to 25 who received CD19-directed CAR/T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: Neurotoxicity occurred in 19 of 43 (44%) subjects. Nine subjects (21%) had CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurological symptoms, with no neurotoxicity-related deaths. Reversible delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, tremor, and seizures were most commonly observed. Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores >/=9 had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for grade >/=3 neurotoxicity, and 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity for grade >/=2 neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome, abnormal past brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and higher peak CAR-T cell numbers in blood, but not cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF levels of S100 calcium-binding protein B and glial fibrillary acidic protein increased during neurotoxicity, indicating astrocyte injury. There were concomitant increases in CSF white blood cells, protein, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and granzyme B (GzB), with concurrent elevation of serum IFNgamma IL-10, GzB, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not IL-6. We did not find direct evidence of endothelial activation. INTERPRETATION: Our data are most consistent with ICANS as a syndrome of systemic inflammation, which affects the brain through compromise of the neurovascular unit and astrocyte injury.

Traditional biomarkers of disease can only distinguish normal state from disease state, and cannot recognize the pre-stable state after drug treatment. RESULTS: A therapeutic effect recognition strategy based on dynamic network biomarkers (DNB) is provided for CML patients' gene expression data. With the DNB criteria, the DNB with 250 genes is selected and the therapeutic effect index (TEI) is constructed for the detection of individual disease. The pre-stable state before the disease condition becomes stable is 1 month. Through functional analysis for the DNB, some genes are confirmed as key genes to affect the progress of CML patients' condition. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a certain theoretical direction and theoretical basis for medical personnel in the treatment of CML patients, and find new therapeutic targets in the future. The biomarkers of CML can help patients to be treated promptly and minimize drug resistance, treatment failure and relapse, which reduce the mortality of CML significantly.",,PMC6509869,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)', 'Dynamic network biomarkers (DNB)', 'Pre-stable state', 'Therapeutic effect index (TEI)', 'Treatment time']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radotinib, which is approved in South Korea as a second-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, inhibits the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. However, the effects of radotinib on Aurora kinase expression in acute myeloid leukemia are not well studied. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of acute myeloid leukemia cells was increased by radotinib treatment. Radotinib significantly decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin B1, the key regulators of G2/M phase, and inhibited the expression of Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B in acute myeloid leukemia cells. In addition, radotinib decreased the expression and binding between p-Aurora kinase A and TPX2, which are required for spindle assembly. Furthermore, it reduced Aurora kinase A and polo-like kinase 1 phosphorylation and suppressed the expression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulin in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, radotinib significantly suppressed the key regulators of G2/M phase including cyclin B1 and Aurora kinase A in a xenograft animal model. Therefore, our results suggest that radotinib can abrogate acute myeloid leukemia cell growth both in vitro and in vivo and may serve as a candidate agent or a chemosensitizer for treating acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Aurora kinase', 'antileukemic activity', 'cell cycle arrest', 'radotinib']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6014-7977'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen patients were treated at three dose levels (DL), and an additional 10 were treated at the MTD. The MTD was DL3: lenalidomide 5 mg daily D8-21 of C1, then 10 mg D1-21 of C2-6. One DLT occurred at DL2 (pulmonary embolus). Grade >/=3 toxicities included neutropenia (52.2%), rash (26.1%), anemia (21.7%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and febrile neutropenia (13.0%). Of 13, 9 treated at the MTD required dose modification, most for neutropenia (5). OR and CR rates were 87% and 39%, respectively. Lenalidomide-BR could be safely administered and was active as initial CLL therapy, although frequent dose modification at the MTD suggests that lenalidomide 10 mg is too high for most patients.

METHODS: A total of 97 patients with favism who were referred to the University hospital in 2016-2017 were studied. KEY FINDINGS: These patients experienced acute hemolysis following beans meal. These patients were either treated with blood transfusion, antibiotics or combination of both.

We focus on disparities in survival as well as other health-related outcomes, including end-of-life care and late effects. RECENT FINDINGS: While progress has been made in decreasing some disparities, most notably in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, disparities along many axes persist. Proposed etiologies include differences in the genomic alterations of the leukemia itself to differences in access to care that operate through socioeconomic status, insurance, and geographic location. As approaches to therapy become increasingly technical and complex, particular attention to the equitable distribution of these personalized therapeutic interventions is essential. Moving beyond simple descriptive studies to focus on mechanisms of existing disparities will allow for design of interventions to reduce or eliminate disparities in pediatric leukemia.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Disparities', '*Leukemia', '*Mortality', '*Race/ethnicity', '*Survivorship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A retrospective descriptive study design was used to determine the patterns of Hematologic malignancies diagnosed at the Eritrean National Health Laboratory from October 2015 to July 2017. Results: Out of 207 patients who did bone marrow aspiration 52 patients were hematologic malignancy cases. The male to female ratio was 1:1. The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 80 years. Of the 52 patients 19, were less than 20 years of age and the remaining 33 were 20 years and above. Acute leukemia was the most common hematologic malignancy in the study area. It affected 18 of the cases followed by chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, and myeloprofilerative neoplasms. The presenting signs and symptoms in their decreasing frequency were generalized body weakness/fatigue, splenomegaly, fever, anemia, and lymphadenopathy.

Mice lacking these three kinases were viable. Further, in human hematological malignancies, these proteins are overexpressed making them suitable targets. Several small molecule inhibitors against this enzyme were synthesized and tested. AZD1208, an orally available small-molecule drug, inhibits all three PIM kinases at a low nanomolar range. AZD1208 has been tested in clinical trials for patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, especially acute myelogenous leukemia. The present study evaluated the efficacy and biological actions of AZD1208 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. CLL cells had higher levels of PIM2 protein and mRNAs than did normal lymphocytes from healthy donors. Treatment of CLL lymphocytes with AZD1208 resulted in modest cell death, whereas practically no cytotoxicity was observed in healthy lymphocytes. To determine the mechanism by which AZD1208 inhibits PIM kinase function, we evaluated PIM kinase pathway and downstream substrates. Because peripheral blood CLL cells are replicationally quiescent, we analyzed substrates involved in apoptosis, transcription, and translation but not cell cycle targets. AZD1208 inhibited protein translation by decreasing phosphorylation levels of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). AZD1208 induced autophagy in replicationally-quiescent CLL cells, which is consistent with protein translation inhibition. These data suggest that AZD1208 may elicit cytotoxicity in CLL cells through inhibiting translation and autophagy induction.",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6497463,,['NOTNLM'],"['PIM kinase', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'protein translation']",,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST VG received funding from AstraZeneca to participate in', 'biomarker studies during the clinical trial for patients with AML and a sponsored', 'research agreement to define biomarkers in AML cell lines.

Epub 2019 May 9.,"The preferred post-remission therapy for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) remains uncertain. In this retrospective, multicenter study, we compared the outcomes for older AML patients (age 60-77 years) receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) (n = 431) with those treated on prospective National Clinical Trials Network induction and nontransplantation chemotherapy (CT) consolidation trials (n = 211). AlloHCT patients were younger (median age: 64.2 versus 67.9 years, p < 0.001), but more frequently had high-risk AML (high WBC, secondary AML, and unfavorable cytogenetics). Overall survival (OS) was worse in alloHCT during the first 9 months after CR1 (HR = 1.52, p = 0.02), but was significantly better thereafter (HR = 0.53, p < 0.0001) relative to CT. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) following HCT was worse in the first 9 months (HR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.5-5.2, p = 0.0009), while post-HCT relapse was significantly less frequent beyond 9 months (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29-0.61, p < 0.0001). Despite higher early TRM, alloHCT recipients had superior long-term OS [29% (24-34%) versus CT 13.8% (9-21%) at 5 years]. Although this is a retrospective analysis with potential biases, it indicates that alloHCT led to heightened early risks from TRM, yet reduced relapse and superior long-term survival relative to CT in older AML patients in CR1.","['U10 CA180795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6842042,['NIHMS1044092'],,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6896-6213', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2234-7430', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8568-4522']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 9.,"Ikaros encodes a transcription factor that functions as a tumor suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The mechanisms through which Ikaros regulates gene expression and cellular proliferation in T-ALL are unknown. Re-introduction of Ikaros into Ikaros-null T-ALL cells resulted in cessation of cellular proliferation and induction of T-cell differentiation. We performed dynamic, global, epigenomic, and gene expression analyses to determine the mechanisms of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity. Our results identified novel Ikaros functions in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression: Ikaros directly regulates de novo formation and depletion of enhancers, de novo formation of active enhancers and activation of poised enhancers; Ikaros directly induces the formation of super-enhancers; and Ikaros demonstrates pioneering activity by directly regulating chromatin accessibility. Dynamic analyses demonstrate the long-lasting effects of Ikaros DNA binding on enhancer activation, de novo formation of enhancers and super-enhancers, and chromatin accessibility. Our results establish that Ikaros' tumor suppressor function occurs via global regulation of the enhancer and super-enhancer landscape and through pioneering activity. Expression analysis identified a large number of novel signaling pathways that are directly regulated by Ikaros and Ikaros-induced enhancers, and that are responsible for the cessation of proliferation and induction of T-cell differentiation in T-ALL cells.","['R01 HG009906/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK110108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002015/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA221109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002014/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA209829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM124820/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6842075,['NIHMS1524483'],,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7025-5821'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 9.,"Alterations of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are found in different cancers, in particular in carcinomas of adults. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), TP53 mutations are infrequent but enriched at relapse. As in most cancers, mainly DNA-binding domain missense mutations are found, resulting in accumulation of mutant p53, poor therapy response, and inferior outcome. Different strategies to target mutant p53 have been developed including reactivation of p53's wildtype function by the small molecule APR-246. We investigated TP53 mutations in cell lines and 62 B-cell precursor ALL samples and evaluated the activity of APR-246 in TP53-mutated or wildtype ALL. We identified cases with TP53 missense mutations, high (mutant) p53 expression and insensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin. In TP53-mutated ALL, APR-246 induced apoptosis showing strong anti-leukemia activity. APR-246 restored mutant p53 to its wildtype conformation, leading to pathway activation with induction of transcriptional targets and re-sensitization to genotoxic therapy in vitro and in vivo In addition, induction of oxidative stress contributed to APR-246-mediated cell death. In a preclinical model of patient-derived TP53-mutant ALL, APR-246 reduced leukemia burden and synergized strongly with the genotoxic agent doxorubicin, leading to superior leukemia-free survival in vivo Thus, targeting mutant p53 by APR-246, restoring its tumor suppressive function, seems to be an effective therapeutic strategy for this high-risk group of TP53-mutant ALL.",,PMC6939517,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 Jan;105(1):10-11.

Epub 2019 May 9.,"There are no validated molecular biomarkers to identify newly-diagnosed individuals with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia likely to respond poorly to imatinib and who might benefit from first-line treatment with a more potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our inability to predict these 'high-risk' individuals reflects the poorly understood heterogeneity of the disease. To investigate the potential of genetic variants in epigenetic modifiers as biomarkers at diagnosis, we used Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing of 71 candidate genes for predicting response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and probability of disease progression. A total of 124 subjects with newly-diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia began with imatinib (n=62) or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=62) and were classified as responders or non-responders based on the BCRABL1 transcript levels within the first year and the European LeukemiaNet criteria for failure. Somatic variants affecting 21 genes (e.g. ASXL1, IKZF1, DNMT3A, CREBBP) were detected in 30% of subjects, most of whom were non-responders (41% non-responders, 18% responders to imatinib, 38% non-responders, 25% responders to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors). The presence of variants predicted the rate of achieving a major molecular response, event-free survival, progression-free survival and chronic myeloid leukemia-related survival in the imatinib but not the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors cohort. Rare germline variants had no prognostic significance irrespective of treatment while some pre-leukemia variants suggest a multi-step development of chronic myeloid leukemia. Our data suggest that identification of somatic variants at diagnosis facilitates stratification into imatinib responders/non-responders, thereby allowing earlier use of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which, in turn, may overcome the negative impact of such variants on disease progression.",,PMC6959189,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,['Haematologica. 2019 Dec;104(12):2327-2329.

Print 2020.,"In older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, the more frequent presence of biologically inherent therapy-resistant disease and increased comorbidities translate to poor overall survival and therapeutic challenges. Optimal front-line therapies for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia remain controversial. We retrospectively evaluated survival outcomes in 980 elderly (>/=70 years) acute myeloid leukemia patients from a single institution between 1995 and 2016. Four treatment categories were compared: high-intensity (daunorubicin/cytarabine or equivalent), hypomethylating agent, low-intensity (low-dose cytarabine or similar without hypomethylating agents), and supportive care therapy (including hydroxyurea). At a median follow up of 20.5 months, the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 7.1 months. Multivariate analysis identified secondary acute myeloid leukemia, poor-risk cytogenetics, performance status, front-line therapy, age, white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level at diagnosis as having an impact on survival. High-intensity therapy was used in 360 patients (36.7%), hypomethylating agent in 255 (26.0%), low-intensity therapy in 91 (9.3%), and supportive care in 274 (28.0%). Pairwise comparisons between hypomethylating agent therapy and the three other treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant superior median overall survival with hypomethylating agent [14.4 months) vs high-intensity therapy 10.8 months, hazard ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.65; P =0.004], low-intensity therapy (5.9 months, hazard ratio 2.01, 95%CI: 1.53-2.62; P<0.0001), and supportive care (2.1 months, hazard ratio 2.94, 95%CI: 2.39-3.61; P<0.0001). Our results indicate a significant survival benefit with hypomethylating agents compared to high-intensity, low-intensity, or supportive care. Additionally, high-intensity chemotherapy resulted in superior overall outcomes compared to low-intensity therapy and supportive care. Results from this study highlight the need for novel therapeutic approaches besides utilization of intensive chemotherapy in this specific aged population.","['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7012500,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 Jan 31;105(2):249-251.

The equilibrium between these two processes is essential to assure the correct number of determined cells at a given time at a given place. Using genetic approaches and correlative microscopy, we show that Tramtrack-69 (Ttk69, a Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac - Zinc Finger (BTB-ZF) transcription factor ortholog of the human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger factor) plays an essential role in controlling this balance. In the Drosophila bristle cell lineage, which produces the external sensory organs composed by a neuron and accessory cells, we show that ttk69 loss-of-function leads to supplementary neural-type cells at the expense of accessory cells. Our data indicate that Ttk69 (1) promotes cell cycle exit of newborn terminal cells by downregulating CycE, the principal cyclin involved in S-phase entry, and (2) regulates cell-fate acquisition and terminal differentiation, by downregulating the expression of hamlet and upregulating that of Suppressor of Hairless, two transcription factors involved in neural-fate acquisition and accessory cell differentiation, respectively. Thus, Ttk69 plays a central role in shaping neural cell lineages by integrating molecular mechanisms that regulate progenitor cell cycle exit and cell-fate commitment.",,PMC6614892,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hamlet', '*Ttk69', '*cyclin-E', '*precursor cells', '*sensory organs']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 by the Genetics Society of America.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This kinase is known for its ability to phosphorylate the main extrusion pump (ABCB1) related to the MDR phenotype. OBJECTIVE: In the present work, we tested a new mechanistic insight on the AZD1208 (PIM-1 specific inhibitor) under interaction with chemotherapy agents such as Daunorubicin (DNR) and Vincristine (VCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to verify a potential cytotoxic effect based on pharmacological synergism, two MDR cell lines were used: Lucena (resistant to VCR) and FEPS (resistant to DNR), both derived from the K562 non-MDR cell line, by MTT analyses. The activity of Pgp was ascertained by measuring accumulation and the directional flux of Rh123. Furthermore, we performed a molecular docking simulation to delve into the molecular mechanism of PIM-1 alone, and combined with chemotherapeutic agents (VCR and DNR). RESULTS: Our in vitro results have shown that AZD1208 alone decreases cell viability of MDR cells. However, co-exposure of AZD1208 and DNR or VCR reverses this effect. When we analyzed the ABCB1 activity AZD1208 alone was not able to affect the pump extrusion. Differently, co-exposure of AZD1208 and DNR or VCR impaired ABCB1 activity, which could be explained by compensatory expression of abcb1 or other extrusion pumps not analyzed here. Docking analysis showed that AZD1208 is capable of performing hydrophobic interactions with PIM-1 ATP- binding-site residues with stronger interaction-based negative free energy (FEB, kcal/mol) than the ATP itself, mimicking an ATP-competitive inhibitory pattern of interaction. On the same way, VCR and DNR may theoretically interact at the same biophysical environment of AZD1208 and also compete with ATP by the PIM-1 active site. These evidences suggest that AZD1208 may induce pharmacodynamic interaction with VCR and DNR, weakening its cytotoxic potential in the ATP-binding site from PIM-1 observed in the in vitro experiments. CONCLUSION: Finally, the current results could have a pre-clinical relevance potential in the rational polypharmacology strategies to prevent multiple-drugs resistance in human leukemia cancer therapy.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD1208', 'Human erythroleukemia cell line', 'Molecular docking', 'Molecular docking simulations', 'Multidrug-resistance', 'PIM-1 kinase.']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective HDAC6 inhibitors is important to minimise the side effects of pan inhibition. Thus, new class of hydroxamic acid-based derivatives were designed on structural basis to perform preferential activity against HDAC6 targeting solid tumours. Interestingly, 1-benzylbenzimidazole-2-thio-N-hydroxybutanamide 10a showed impressive preference with submicromolar potency against HDAC6 (IC50 = 510 nM). 10a showed cytotoxic activity with interesting profile against CCHE-45 at (IC50 = 112.76 microM) when compared to standard inhibitor Tubacin (IC50 = 20 microM). Western blot analysis of acetylated-alpha-tubulin verified the HDAC6 inhibiting activity of 10a. Moreover, the insignificant difference in acetylated-alpha-tubulin induced by 10a and Tubacin implied the on-target cytotoxic activity of 10a. Docking of 10a in the binding site of HDAC6 attributed the activity of 10a to pi-pi stacking with the amino acids of the hydrophobic channel of HDAC6 and capture of zinc metal in bidentate fashion.

However, 15%-20% of CML patients ultimately develop resistance to imatinib and then progress to an accelerated phase and eventually to a blast crisis, limiting treatment options and resulting in a poor survival rate. Thus, we investigated whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) could be used as a potential anticancer therapy for imatinib-resistant CML (IR-CML) patients. By applying a noninvasive apoptosis detection sensor (NIADS), we found that panobinostat significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in K562 cells. A further investigation showed that panobinostat induced apoptosis in both K562 and imatinib-resistant K562 (IR-K562) cells mainly via H3 and H4 histone acetylation, whereas panobinostat targeted cancer stem cells (CSCs) in IR-K562 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, we found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 knockout cells significantly induced cell apoptosis, indicating that the regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is extremely important in maintaining K562 cell survival. All information in this study indicates that regulating HDAC activity provides therapeutic benefits against CML and IR-CML in the clinic.","['CMU107-N-07/China Medical University', '102-2320-B-038-039-MY3/the Ministry of Science and Technology', 'MOHW107-TDU-B-212-114014/the Health and welfare surcharge of tobacco products']",PMC6539538,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'CRISPR/Cas9', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'imatinib', 'imatinib-resistant']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2901-2681', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0854-1170']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 6.,AIMS: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 lies at the convergence point of key pathways involved in many malignancies including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the unfolded protein response have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different cancers by influencing key cellular processes such as apoptosis. We investigated the differential expression of STAT3 pathway-related genes and proteins under ERS in OSCC. METHODS: Three normal oral keratinocyte (NOK) and three OSCC cell lines were subjected to tunicamycin to induce ERS for 24h or to the vehicle medium as control. A pathway-focussed array was used to analyse the modulation of STAT3 pathway gene expression under ERS using qPCR. The expression of key regulated proteins was investigated in the cell lines using immunocytochemistry and in 76 OSCC and 9 normal oral mucosa (NOM) tissue samples using tissue microarray technology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: ERS resulted in up-regulation of interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) gene in NOK cell lines (p=0.001) and IL5 (p=0.005) and IL22 (p=0.024) in OSCC cell lines. Greater STAT3 (p=0.019) and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (p=0.042) protein expression was observed in treated than untreated NOK cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: The gene and protein regulation patterns show that ERS plays a role in modifying the tumour microenvironment in OSCC by up-regulating tumour-promoting cytokines.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer biology', '*Cell signalling', '*Cytokines', '*ER stress', '*Oral carcinogenesis', '*STAT3', '*Tissue microarray']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research has demonstrated the close relationship of mitochondria with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), both at the physical and the functional level. In an effort to define the combined effect of mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) and ER stress in the proinflammatory activities of macrophages, the human macrophage-like monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was treated with mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) blockers, and changes in the cellular responses upon stimulation by interferon (IFN)-gamma were analyzed. Inducing mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) with ETC blockers resulted in suppression of IFN-induced activation of JAK1 and STAT1/3, as well as the expression of STAT1-regulated genes. In addition, experiments utilizing pharmacological modulators of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-deficient HeLa cells demonstrated that these suppressive effects are mediated by the LKB1-AMPK pathway. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of ER stress sensors failed to affect these processes, thus indicating that involvement of ER stress is not required. These results indicate that MD, induced by blocking the ETC, affects IFN-induced activation of JAK-STAT and associated inflammatory changes in THP-1 cells through the LKB1-AMPK pathway independently of ER stress.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*ER stress', '*JAK-STAT', '*dysfonction mitochondriale', '*inflammation', '*macrophage', '*mitochondrial dysfunction', '*stress du RE']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Timely diagnosis is essential but challenging. Herein we retrospectively describe 221 cases of antifungal treatments (AFT) administered in a monocentric real-life cohort of hematological malignancies. Between January 2010 and July 2017, 196 oncohematologic patients were treated with AFT at our Hematology Department. Diagnosis of IFIs was carried out according to EORTC/MSG-2008 guidelines.The most represented disease was acute myeloid leukemia (104 patients). Median age was 61 years; at fever onset 177 (80%) patients had a neutrophil count<0.5x109/L. Twenty-nine (13%) patients were receiving antifungal prophylaxis (26 posaconazole, 2 fluconazole, 1 itraconazole). The incidence of AFT was 13%. Serum galactomannan antigen (GM) was positive in 20% of the tested cases, while 85% of the patients had a CT scan suggestive for IFI. Twenty-one percent of these cases had a GM positive. Sixty-five out of 196 patients (33%) showed positive culture results, in particular Candida spp. were identified in 45 isolates, while Aspergillus spp. in 16 cases. Fourteen patients presented multiple positivity. Twenty-two (10%) cases were classified as proven IFIs, 61 (28%) as probable and 81 (37%) as possible, but 57 (26%) cases could not be classified. Fifty-nine percent of the patients received single agent AFT, 37% sequential AFT, 8% a combination regimen. Liposomal-amphotericin-B was the most used AFT. IFIs attributable mortality was 20%. This epidemiologic survey underlined a persistent significant use of AFT and a high mortality rate of IFIs. We suggest that further powerful diagnostic approaches should be investigated to improve the diagnostic accuracy and potential therapeutic implication.",,PMC6508710,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5356-8690'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a cross-sectional diffusion imaging study of 314 patients treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at a single institution and 92 healthy controls. An asymmetry index based on diffusion metrics was computed to quantify brain microstructural asymmetry. The effects of age and the asymmetry metrics of the two cohorts were examined with t-tests and linear models. We discovered two new types of microstructural asymmetry. Myelin-related asymmetry in controls was prominent in the back brain (89% right), whereas axon-related asymmetry occurred in the front brain (67% left) and back brain (88% right). These asymmetries indicate that white matter is more mature and more myelinated in the left back brain, potentially explaining the leftward lateralization of language and visual functions. The asymmetries increase throughout childhood and adolescence (P = 0.04) but were significantly less in patients treated for ALL (P<0.01), especially in younger patients.

METHODOLOGY: An evaluation was done on all patients with hematological malignancy who developed a febrile neutropenic episode (FNE) after cytotoxic chemotherapy in the Department of Hematology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, between January 2007 and December 2008. RESULTS: A total of 294 primary FNEs that responded to the initial empirical or targeted treatment were included in the study, and secondary infections developed after 72 (24.5%) of 294 primary FNEs. Risk factors for secondary infections were determined as acute leukemia as the underlying disease, salvage chemotherapy for refractory/relapse diseases, prolonged neutropenia (10 days and over), Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASSC) score < 21, and fungal infection during the primary episode. The mortality rate of patients who developed secondary infections was significantly higher compared to patients without secondary infections (27.8% and 5.4%, respectively; p = 0.001).

However, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market due to lack of clinical benefit in the confirmatory phase III trial. In 2012, several investigator cooperative studies using a different dosing regimen showed efficacy, but pharmacokinetic (PK) data were not collected in these trials. Through simulation of expected concentrations for new dosing regimens, PK/pharmacodynamic modeling was able to support the safety and efficacy of these regimens.

Epub 2019 May 8.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of 23 common types of cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with the general Chinese population. METHODS: Based on the Shanghai Hospital Link database, 410 191 patients with T2D (age 20-99 years) were identified from July 2013 to December 2016, and were followed-up for cancer incidence until December 2017. RESULTS: In all, 8485 cases of newly diagnosed cancer were identified. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of total cancer were 1.34 and 1.62 among males and females, respectively. Among males with T2D, the risk of cancer of the prostate (highest SIR of 1.86), blood (leukemia, lymphoma), skin, thyroid, kidney, liver, pancreas, lung, colorectum, and stomach was increased significantly. There was a significant decrease in the risk of esophageal cancer. In females with T2D, there were significantly greater risks of cancer of the nasopharynx (highest SIR of 2.33), liver, esophagus, thyroid, lung, pancreas, blood (lymphoma, leukemia), uterus, colorectum, breast, cervix, and stomach. In contrast, there was significantly decrease risk of gallbladder cancer in females with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows significantly increased risks of overall and some site-specific cancers among patients with T2D. We suggest that establishing strategies for regular cancer-specific screening and prevention care among patients with T2D are necessary.","['2016YFC1305500/National Key R&D Program of China', '81670799/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81570707/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81702642/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '20152502/Shanghai Municipal Education Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant', '16YF1409800/Shanghai Sailing Program']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['2', 'cancer', 'risk', 'type 2 diabetes']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7293-5740'],"['(c) 2019 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and', 'John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NGS offers the potential benefit of being able to survey alterations across a wider set of genes, but analytic and clinical challenges associated with incidental findings, germ line variation, turnaround time, and limits of detection must be addressed. Additionally, transcriptome-based testing may offer several distinct benefits beyond traditional DNA-based methods. In addition to testing at disease diagnosis, research indicates potential benefits of genetic testing both prior to disease onset and at remission.

Because cythemias are nonspecific and may reflect either a reactive or neoplastic process, diagnostic workup of these patients is complicated and requires integration of numerous diagnostic modalities. Careful morphologic evaluation of the PB smear may provide insights into the underlying cause of the abnormal counts (such as the presence of teardrop erythrocytes in myelofibrosis or granulocytic dysplasia with left shift in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia). However, these morphologic findings need to be interpreted in concert with clinical findings and other laboratory results. In recent years, there has been a wealth of new genetic data in the field of MPN and many recurrent mutations have been identified, especially in cases lacking Philadelphia chromosome. Many of these genes impact the diagnosis and/or prognosis. Although certain mutations are preferentially enriched in specific MPN types, none of these mutations are disease defining; therefore, a thorough workup should always include a bone marrow biopsy for morphologic evaluation and diagnosis.

Regardless of age of presentation and severity of symptoms related to thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction, a subset of patients with IT are at increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasms during their life time, particularly those with germline autosomal dominant mutations in RUNX1, ANKRD26, and ETV6. Patients may present with isolated thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytic dysmorphia or atypia on baseline bone marrow evaluation, without constituting myelodysplasia (MDS). Bone marrow features may overlap with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or sporadic MDS leading to misdiagnosis. Progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/ acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) may be accompanied by progressive bi- or pancytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, increased blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities, acquisition of bi-allelic mutations in the underlying gene with germline mutation, or additional somatic mutations in genes associated with myeloid malignancy. A subset of patients may present with MDS/AML at a young age, underscoring the growing concern for evaluating young patients with MDS/AML for germline mutations predisposing to myeloid neoplasm. Early recognition of germline mutation and predisposition to myeloid malignancy permits appropriate treatment, adequate monitoring for disease progression, proper donor selection for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as genetic counseling of the affected patients and their family members.

High-throughput sequencing technologies now allow examination of antigen receptor repertoires at single-nucleotide and, more recently, single-cell resolution. The TCR repertoire can be altered in the context of infections, malignancies or immunological disorders. Here we examined the diversity of TCR clonality and its association with pathogenesis and prognosis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a malignancy caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). We analyzed 62 sets of high-throughput RNA sequencing data from 59 samples of HTLV-1-infected individuals-asymptomatic carriers (ACs), smoldering, chronic, acute and lymphoma ATL subtypes-and three uninfected controls to evaluate TCR distribution. Based on these TCR profiles, CD4-positive cells and ACs showed polyclonal patterns, whereas ATL patients showed oligo- or monoclonal patterns (with 446 average clonotypes across samples). Expression of TCRalpha and TCRbeta genes in the dominant clone differed among the samples. ACs, CD4-positive samples and smoldering patients showed significantly higher TCR diversity compared with chronic, acute and lymphoma subtypes. CDR3 sequence length distribution, amino acid conservation and gene usage variability for ATL patients resembled those of peripheral blood cells from ACs and healthy donors. Thus, determining monoclonal architecture and clonal diversity by RNA sequencing might be useful for prognostic purposes and for personalizing ATL diagnosis and assessment of treatments.",,PMC6502857,,['NOTNLM'],"['Genome informatics', 'High-throughput screening']",,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gilteritinib is a highly-specific, potent FLT3/AXL inhibitor with demonstrated activity against FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations. Compared with salvage chemotherapy, treatment with once-daily oral gilteritinib demonstrated a clinical benefit in patients with FLT3-mutated relapsed/refractory AML, which led to its recent approval in Japan and the United States. We investigated the effects of gilteritinib combined with cytarabine plus daunorubicin/idarubicin, or combined with azacitidine in human FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD (+)) AML cell lines and xenografted mouse models. Gilteritinib induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, or azacitidine potentiated apoptosis. Gilteritinib alone or combined with cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, or azacitidine, inhibited anti-apoptotic protein expression in MV4-11 cells. In xenografted mice, administration of cytarabine, idarubicin, or azacitidine in combination with gilteritinib had little impact on plasma or intratumor PK profiles of gilteritinib, cytarabine, idarubicin, or azacitidine. Gilteritinib combined with chemotherapy reduced tumor volume to a greater extent than either gilteritinib or chemotherapy alone. Of note, the addition of cytarabine plus daunorubicin/idarubicin led to tumor regression in mice, with complete regression observed in six out of eight mice in both triple combination groups. These findings support the investigation of gilteritinib combined with chemotherapy in patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML, including those who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.",,PMC6493465,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3 inhibition', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'combination therapy', 'internal tandem duplication']",,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST YU, MM, YK, SK, NK, and MT are employees of Astellas', 'Pharma, Inc.

However, the current therapeutic challenges of DNMTis include development of resistance, severe side effects and no or partial treatment responses, as observed in more than half of the patients. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the mechanisms of action of these drugs. In order to discover molecular targets of DNMTi therapy, we identified 638 novel CpGs with an increased methylation in response to decitabine treatment in HCT116 cell lines and validated the findings in multiple cancer types (e.g., bladder, ovarian, breast, and lymphoma) cell lines, bone marrow mononuclear cells from primary leukemia patients, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and ascites from platinum resistance epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Azacytidine treatment also increased methylation of these CpGs in colon, ovarian, breast, and lymphoma cancer cell lines. Methylation at 166 identified CpGs strongly correlated (|r|>/= 0.80) with corresponding gene expression in HCT116 cell line. Differences in methylation at some of the identified CpGs and expression changes of the corresponding genes was observed in TCGA colon cancer tissue as compared to adjacent healthy tissue. Our analysis revealed that hypermethylated CpGs are involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by P53 and olfactory receptor pathways, hence influencing DNMTi responses. In conclusion, we showed hypermethylation of CpGs as a novel mechanism of action for DNMTi agents and identified 638 hypermethylated molecular targets (CpGs) common to decitabine and azacytidine therapy. These novel results suggest that hypermethylation of CpGs should be considered when predicting the DNMTi responses and side effects in cancer patients.",,PMC6491738,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methyltransferase inhibitors', 'alternative splicing', 'anticancer treatment', 'azacytidine', 'decitabine', 'olfactory receptor pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for HLA-A, -B antigens and -DRB1 allele, better HLA matching was associated with lower non-relapse mortality (P = 0.011) but higher relapse (P = 0.046), resulting in no improvement in survival (P = 0.680). Taking the allele level for each HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 into consideration was less useful for predicting non-relapse mortality (P = 0.198). These findings suggest that the less stringent criteria for UCB unit selection are acceptable for Japanese patient population and perhaps even more beneficial in terms of providing a better chance to find a suitable UCB unit.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1496-376X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8959-6271', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6704-3633']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the patient developed slight edema, pleural effusion, and cardiac effusion 6 months after BMT, his clinical condition improved with furosemide treatment. The patient was transfused with red blood cells for the management of anemia 8 months after BMT. He developed acute respiratory failure with pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage 80 min after the transfusion. He was diagnosed with transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) due to the presence of acute pulmonary congestion and depressed left ventricular systolic function. Reduced circulatory load due to sufficient furosemide led to ventilator weaning 3 days later. Other causes of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage were excluded, and the patient's condition improved by cardiac failure treatment only. This clinical course indicated that pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage would breakdown the blood vessels due to acute pulmonary congestion. Chemotherapy and prolonged anemia are high risks for cardiac failure in patients with hematological malignancies. Therefore, the possibility of cardiac failure is considered when patients with hematological malignancies have fluid retention, such as cardiac enlargement, edema, and pleural effusion. Moreover, the body fluids should be monitored before and after blood transfusion.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological malignancies', 'Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage', 'Transfusion-associated Circulatory overload', 'Transfusion-related Acute lung injury']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 8.,"A major obstacle to curing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the intrinsic resistance of CML stem cells (CMLSCs) to the drug imatinib mesylate (IM). Prosurvival genes that are preferentially expressed in CMLSCs compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) represent potential therapeutic targets for selectively eradicating CMLSCs. However, the discovery of such preferentially expressed genes has been hampered by the inability to completely separate CMLSCs from HSCs, which display a very similar set of surface markers. To overcome this challenge, and to minimize confounding effects of individual differences in gene expression profiles, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on CMLSCs and HSCs that were isolated from the same patient and distinguished based on the presence or absence of BCR-ABL. Among genes preferentially expressed in CMLSCs is PIM2, which encodes a prosurvival serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits the proapoptotic protein BAD. We show that IM resistance of CMLSCs is due, at least in part, to maintenance of BAD phosphorylation by PIM2. We find that in CMLSCs, PIM2 expression is promoted by both a BCR-ABL-dependent (IM-sensitive) STAT5-mediated pathway and a BCR-ABL-independent (IM-resistant) STAT4-mediated pathway. Combined treatment with IM and a PIM inhibitor synergistically increases apoptosis of CMLSCs, suppresses colony formation, and significantly prolongs survival in a mouse CML model, with a negligible effect on HSCs. Our results reveal a therapeutically targetable mechanism of IM resistance in CMLSCs. The experimental approach that we describe can be generally applied to other malignancies that harbor oncogenic fusion proteins or other characteristic genetic markers.","['R01 CA176179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA209298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA222590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI132963/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6535024,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CML stem cells', '*PIM2', '*imatinib resistance', '*targeted therapy']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3017-3298'],,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 8.,"Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are common in many cancer types, including the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtype known as complex karyotype AML (CK-AML). Here, we identify a gain-of-function (GOF) Trp53 mutation that accelerates CK-AML initiation beyond p53 loss and, surprisingly, is required for disease maintenance. The Trp53(R172H) mutation (TP53(R175H) in humans) exhibits a neomorphic function by promoting aberrant self-renewal in leukemic cells, a phenotype that is present in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) even prior to their transformation. We identify FOXH1 as a critical mediator of mutant p53 function that binds to and regulates stem cell-associated genes and transcriptional programs. Our results identify a context where mutant p53 acts as a bona fide oncogene that contributes to the pathogenesis of CK-AML and suggests a common biological theme for TP53 GOF in cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates how a GOF p53 mutant can hijack an embryonic transcription factor to promote aberrant self-renewal. In this context, mutant Trp53 functions as an oncogene to both initiate and sustain myeloid leukemia and suggests a potential convergent activity of mutant Trp53 across cancer types.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.","['T32 CA160001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA087497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA192835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC6606372,['NIHMS1528905'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5060-5487', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6893-2822', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0636-8845', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5284-9650']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and outcomes of 19 patients with CML-T315I receiving different treatments. The T315 I mutations in these patients were detected by examination of BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutation by RTQ-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The relapse following the treatments, defined as hematological, cytogenetic and molecular biological recurrences, were analyzed in these patients. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients with CML-T315I, 14 (73.7%) were in CML-CP stage at the initial diagnosis, and 13 (81.2%) were high-risk patients based on the Sokal scores. All the 19 patients were treated with TKI after the initial diagnosis, and during the treatment, 15 (78.9%) patients were found to have additional chromosomal aberrations, and 10 (52.6%) had multiple mutations; 13 (68.4%) of the patients experienced disease progression (accelerated phase/blast crisis) before the detection of T315I mutation, with a median time of 40 months (5-120 months) from the initial diagnosis to the mutation detection. After detection of the mutation, 12 patients were treated with ponatinib and 7 were managed with the conventional chemotherapy regimen, and their overall survival rates at 3 years were 83.3% and 14.2%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CML patients resistant to TKI are more likely to have T315I mutations, whose detection rate is significantly higher in the progressive phase than in the chronic phase. These patients often have additional chromosomal aberrations and multiple gene mutations with poor prognoses and a high recurrence rate even after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Long-term maintenance therapy with ponatinib may improve the prognosis and prolong the survival time of the patients.",,PMC6765683,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'T315I', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'ponatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of bortezomib in the absence or presence of Bcl-2 inhibitors (obatoclax, AT-101 and ABT-199) in Jurkat cells. The effects of drug treatment on the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, LC3B, p62, ubiquitin, BiP/Grp78, p-JNK, p-p38 and CHOP proteins were examined by Western blotting. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of bortezomib and Bcl-2 inhibitors (obatoclax, AT-101 and ABT-199) on cell apoptosis. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of the key regulatory factors of unfolded protein reaction (UPR). A zebrafish xenograft model was used to study the anti-tumor effect of bortezomib, obatoclax and their combination in vivo. RESULTS: Bortezomib or Bcl-2 inhibitors alone inhibited the cell viability of Jurkat cells, but only obatoclax and bortezomib showed synergistic cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effect. Obatoclax, rather than AT-101 and ABT- 199, blocked autophagic flux in the cells evidenced by concomitant accumulation of LC3B- and p62. Both bortezomib and obatoclax alone caused accumulation of polyubiquinated proteins, and their combination showed a synergistic effect, which was consistent with their synergistic cytotoxicity. The dual blockade of proteasome and autophagy by the combination of bortezomib and obatoclax triggered unfolded protein response followed by cell apoptosis. Preventing UPS dysfunction by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effect of bortezomib in combination with obatoclax. In zebrafish xenograft models, bortezomib combined with obatoclax significantly decreased tumor foci formation.

LMV inhibits CMV replication by binding to the viral terminase complex. However, first cases of clinical LMV resistance have been occurred. Here we report a fast breakthrough of resistant cytomegalovirus during secondary LMV prophylaxis in a hematopoietic-cell transplant recipient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) experienced a CMV-reactivation within the first 4 weeks of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. Administration of LMV was initiated at day + 34. Due to increasing viral loads, LMV treatment was discontinued after 8 days. The patient was then administered with valganciclovir (valGCV) until viral DNA was undetectable. Due to neutropenia, valGCV treatment was switched to LMV secondary prophylaxis. For 4 weeks, the patient maintain virologic suppression. Then, CMV viral loads increased with a fast kinetic. Genotypic testing of the viral polymerase UL54, the kinase UL97 as well as the viral terminase UL56 and UL89 revealed the mutation C325Y in UL56, which is associated with the high level LMV resistance. CONCLUSION: It is known that Letermovir is approved for prophylactic purposes. However, it may be used for some patients with CMV infection who either have failed prior therapies or are unable to tolerate other anti-CMV compounds. Particularly, the administration of LMV should be avoided in patients with detectable viral loads. When this is not possible, viral load must be routinely monitored along with UL56 genotyping. Furthermore, LMV administration at high virus loads may foster the rapid selection of resistant CMV mutants.",,PMC6505103,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogenic hematopoietic-cell transplantation', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Genotyping', 'Letermovir']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2188-1815'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to identity predictors of MDR to allow for rapid and economical assessment of the efficacy of planned antitumor therapy for leukemia patients. The study included 113 patients with acute and chronic leukemias. Prior to antitumor therapy, we measured the sensitivity of tumor cells of patients to the panel of chemotherapeutic drugs, together with MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression as one of the mechanisms of MDR, and compared these data with the response to therapy. The scales for leukemia patients according to therapy response, drug sensitivity of tumor cells, MDR1 mRNA and P-gp levels, and the presence of unfavorable immunological and cytogenetic markers were introduced for subsequent correlation analysis. We show that the drug resistance of tumor cells of leukemia patients estimated in vitro at diagnosis correlates with a poor response to chemotherapy and is usually combined with aberrant and immature immunological markers, cytogenetic abnormalities, and a high expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp. All together, these factors indicate unfavorable prognosis and low survival of leukemia patients. Thus, the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs measured in vitro at diagnosis may have prognostic value for individual types of leukemia.","['grant 14-14-00697/Russian Science Foundation', 'VI.62.1.3, 0309-2016-0005/Russian State Funded Budget Project']",PMC6617197,,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'chemotherapy', 'drug sensitivity', 'leukemia', 'multidrug resistance']",,,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

A promising approach is based on digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Digital PCR (dPCR) is a breakthrough technology designed to provide absolute nucleic acid quantification. It is particularly useful to detect a low amount of target and therefore it represents an alternative method for detecting measurable residual disease (MRD). The main advantages are the high precision, the very reliable quantification, the absolute quantification without the need for a standard curve, and the excellent reproducibility. Nowadays the main disadvantages of this strategy are the costs that are still higher than standard qPCR, the lack of standardized methods, and the limited number of laboratories that are equipped with instruments for dPCR. Several studies describing the possibility and advantages of using digital PCR for the detection of specific leukemic transcripts or mutations have already been published.

DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. ANIMALS: 121 beef bulls >/= 2 years old from 39 Michigan herds. PROCEDURES: Blood, smegma, and semen samples were collected from each bull during a routine breeding soundness examination. An ELISA was used to detect serum anti-BLV antibodies. A coordination of common motifs-quantitative PCR assay was used to detect BLV provirus DNA in blood, smegma, and semen samples. Bulls with positive results on both the BLV serum ELISA and coordination of common motifs-quantitative PCR assay were considered infected with BLV. RESULTS: 19 of 39 (48.7%) herds and 54 of 121 (44.6%) bulls were infected with BLV. Provirus DNA was detected in the blood of all 54 and in smegma of 4 BLV-infected bulls but was not detected in any semen sample. Lymphocyte count was significantly greater in BLV-infected bulls than in uninfected bulls. The proportion of BLV-infected bulls with lymphocytosis (16/54 [29.6%]) was greater than the proportion of uninfected bulls with lymphocytosis (6/67 [9%]). Lymphocyte count was positively associated with BLV proviral load in BLV-infected bulls. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that almost half of beef bulls and herds were infected with BLV, and BLV provirus DNA was detected in the smegma of some BLV-infected bulls.

Its ligand, FLT3 ligand (FL), induces dimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Activation of FLT3 leads to its autophosphorylation and initiation of several signal transduction cascades. Signaling is initiated by the recruitment of signal transduction molecules to activated FLT3 through binding to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the intracellular region of FLT3. Activation of FLT3 mediates cell survival, cell proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. It acts in synergy with several other cytokines to promote its biological effects. Deregulated FLT3 activity has been implicated in several diseases, most prominently in acute myeloid leukemia where around one-third of patients carry an activating mutant of FLT3 which drives the disease and is correlated with poor prognosis. Overactivity of FLT3 has also been implicated in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The observation that gain-of-function mutations of FLT3 can promote leukemogenesis has stimulated the development of inhibitors that target this receptor. Many of these are in clinical trials, and some have been approved for clinical use. However, problems with acquired resistance to these inhibitors are common and, furthermore, only a fraction of patients respond to these selective treatments. This review provides a summary of our current knowledge regarding structural and functional aspects of FLT3 signaling, both under normal and pathological conditions, and discusses challenges for the future regarding the use of targeted inhibition of these pathways for the treatment of patients.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-5336', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1275-5809']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infections related to the use of a central venous catheter (CVC) are difficult to eliminate with systemic antibiotics. Premature catheter removal is often due to retained biofilm infection. This study investigated if the additional use of hydrochloric acid (HCl) as an intraluminal lock solution may prolong the lifetime of the CVC. METHODS: The study was performed retrospectively based on a database including patients with a tunnelled Leonard 10 F dual or triple lumen CVC implanted who received HCl instillation due to bacteraemia during a five-year period. RESULTS: In a total of 71 cases of bacteraemia, HCl instil-lation was performed. Following HCI instillation, the CVC was not removed due to infection in 49 out of 71 patients (69%). Furthermore, 22 patients (31%) retained their CVC until the end of treatment. Non-infectious mortality (19/71), accidental pull (2/71) or mechanical CVC dysfunction (6/71) were other reasons for premature removal. Twenty-two catheters (31%) had to be removed due to ongoing infection. The median time from CVC placement until HCl instillation was 39 days. The median time from HCl instillation until removal of CVC was 58 days.

Epub 2019 May 8.,"Objective: The efficacy of treatment for many cancers has increased dramatically in recent decades and there is a growing number of cancer survivors who need effective contraception. In this paper, a group of experts from the European Society of Contraception set out to define the most frequent cancers in women and summarise the guidelines, reviews and studies that provide information and guidance on contraception for each cancer. Methods: Epidemiological studies were analysed to determine the frequency of cancers in women of reproductive age. A narrative review was performed for each cancer, collecting data about the treatment of the disease, its impact on fertility, and the efficacy, health risks, possible benefits and contraindications of the contraceptive methods available. The recommendations were then summarised. Results: Owing to the large amount of information the results are presented in two parts. Part 1 includes contraception after breast and gynaecological cancers. Part 2 summarises the findings and recommendations regarding contraception in women with skin, gastrointestinal, haematological and endocrine cancers.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Colorectal cancer', 'contraception', 'endocrine tumours', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'melanoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 7.,"The different types of drug resistance encountered in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cannot be fully accounted for by the 17p deletion (and/or TP53 mutation), a complex karyotype (CK), immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes (IGHV) status and gene mutations. Hence, we sought to assess the associations between recurrent genomic abnormalities in CLL and the disease's development and outcome. To this end, we analyzed 64 samples from patients with CLL and gain of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p+), which is frequent in late-stage and relapsed/refractory CLL. We found that fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (a common first-line treatment in CLL) is not effective in removing the 2p+ clone - even in samples lacking a CK, the 17p deletion or unmutated IGHV. Our results suggest strongly that patients with CLL should be screened for 2p+ (using karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization) before a treatment option is chosen. Longer follow-up is now required to evaluate bendamustine-rituximab, ibrutinib, and idelalisib-rituximab treatments.",,PMC6558483,,['NOTNLM'],"['*2p gain', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*drug resistance']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3427-7596', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6613-9302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2932-1081', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7767-755X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3107-6668']",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 7.,"BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were used in our laboratory as negative biological controls for the development of a neuroblastoma (NBL) flow-cytometric (FC) protocol. The accidental, but systematic, identification of rare cell populations (RCP) mimicking NBL cells (CD45(-) /CD56(+) ) in these samples indicated the need for their thorough immunophenotypic identification, in order to elucidate their possible interference in NBL-MRD assessment. PROCEDURE: RCP observed in BM samples from 14 children recovering from BM aplasia due to intensive chemotherapy for B-ALL were investigated with the following markers: CD81, CD200, CD24, GD2, CD73, CD13, CD90, CD146, CD9, CD117, CD10, CD99, and NG2. BM samples from six newly diagnosed patients with NBL and an NBL cell line were simultaneously investigated as positive controls. RESULTS: The frequency of RCP in B-ALL BM samples was < 1/1 x 10(4) cells (bulky lysis), and their immunophenotypic profile was indicative of CD56(+) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) (CD45(-) , CD90(+) , CD146(+) , CD73(+) ). Also, RCP expressed CD81 and CD200, simulating NBL cells. The most useful discriminative markers for CD56(+) MSCs were CD13 and CD73. An appropriate protocol consisting of two tubes with seven color combinations was further proposed: SYTO-16, GD2 (first tube) or CD73 (second tube)-PE, CD24-ECD, CD13-PC5.5, CD45-PC7, CD81-APC, and CD56-APC700. CONCLUSIONS: RCP that were immunophenotypically similar to NBL were identified as CD56(+) MSCs. As these cells might pose an obstacle to accurate NBL disease assessment by FC, especially MRD, an enhanced NBL-FC protocol is proposed for prospective evaluation.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*flow cytometry', '*hematology/oncology', '*mesenchymal stromal cells', '*minimal residual disease', '*neuroblastoma']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1794-6332'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we present a case report of autopsy-proven disseminated Hormographiella aspergillata infection, confirmed by DNA sequencing, in a patient experiencing a relapse of leukemia. This 54-year-old Caucasian man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that had been diagnosed in 1989, after having received a hematopoietic cell allotransplant from a compatible sibling donor, had B-cell lymphoid-blast phase of CML in April of 2013, with multiple relapses. His most recent relapse was in September of 2016, when bone marrow biopsy showed 90% blasts. The results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were positive for filamentous fungus infection. The patient developed encephalopathy and worsening respiratory statusand tachycardia with flutter and hypotension, which resulted in his death. At autopsy, bilateral pleural effusions, multiple right pleural nodules, and subarachnoid hemorrhage were noted. Angioinvasive hyphal fungi were found in the right frontal lobe of the brain and the right upper lobe of the lung. Morphologically, the fungi had multiseptate, branching hyphae. The bronchoalveolar lavage specimen grew a fungus for which the colony morphologic characteristics and microscopic features were compatible with a Hormographiella species. H. aspergillata from the bronchoalveolar lavage was further identified by sequencing the D2 hypervariable region of the large-subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA gene and the full internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hormographiella aspergillata', 'fungal infection', 'fungal sequencing', 'leukemia', 'rare fungus', 'stem cell transplantation']",,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019.

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the EBV-infected cell types in PBMCs among 291 patients. Based on EBV-infected cell types, the clinical features and prognoses of 93 patients with EBV-associated (EBV(+)) T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs) T/NK-LPDs) were investigated over a 5-year period. Results: Although B-cell-type infection was found in immunocompromised patients and patients with asymptomatic high EBV carriage, infectious mononucleosis, EBV(+) B-cell LPDs and B-cell lymphomas, T-cell, NK-cell or multiple-cell-type infection in immunocompetent hosts were highly suggestive of EBV(+) T/NK-LPDs, EBV(+) T/NK-cell lymphomas, and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. Patients with non-B-cell infection had a poorer prognosis than those with B-cell-type infection. In our cohort, 79.6% of patients with EBV(+) T/NK-LPDs were >18 years old, and NK cells were identified as EBV-infected cell type in 54.8%. Nearly half of patients with EBV(+) T/NK-LPDs had genetic defects associated with immunodeficiency. However, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and not genetic defects, was the only parameter correlated with poor prognosis of EBV(+) T/NK-LPDs. Conclusions: Determination of EBV-infected cell types among PBMCs is a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of EBV(+) hematological diseases.In this study, determination of Epstein-Barr virus-infected cell types in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 291 patients with high Epstein-Barr virus loads were retrospectively investigated, which indicate it is a valuable tool for Epstein-Barr virus-associated hematological diseases.",,PMC6499900,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection', 'hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', 'lymphoproliferative disorders']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Mar 6.,"Background: Colorectal cancer is one of the highly malignant cancers with a poor prognosis. The exact mechanism of colorectal cancer progression is not completely known. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) were suggested to participate in the regulation of multiple cancer development, including colorectal cancer. Methods: MiR-4319 expression in colorectal cancer patient samples was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. MiR-4319 was knocked down in the colorectal cancer cells by siRNA transfection to study the role of miR-4319 in the cell cycle and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Results: MiR-4319 expression was found to be inverse correlated with survival in colorectal cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-4319 markedly reduced the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and altered cell cycle distribution. A further experiment showed that ABTB1 is the target gene of miR-4319. MiR-4319 was regulated by PLZF. Conclusion: Our studies indicated that reduced expression of miR-4319 was correlated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients; miR-4319 also suppressed colorectal cancer cell proliferation by targeting ABTB1. ABTB1 might become an excellent therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.",,PMC6488794,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABTB1', '*Colorectal cancer', '*PLZF', '*miR-4319']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alterations that occur in the MSC under leukemic stress are not well known. To deepen on this topic, we have used an in vitro model of the leukemic niche (LN) by coculturing MSC with an acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line (REH) and proceeded to evaluate MSC characteristics and functions. We found that leukemic cells induced in MSC a significant increase both in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and in p53 gene expression. MSC in the LN also showed a persistent production of cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle. Another acute leukemic cell line (SUP-B15) produced almost the same effects on MSC. REH cells adhere strongly to MSC possibly as a result of an increased expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and CD49e in MSC and of CD49d in REH cells. Although mesensphere formation was normal or even increased, multipotent differentiation capacity was impaired in MSC from the LN. A REH-conditioned medium was only partially (about 50%) capable of inducing the same changes in MSC, suggesting that cell-to-cell contact is more efficient in inducing these changes. Despite these important effects on MSC in the LN, REH cells increased their cell adhesion, proliferation rate, and directed-migration capacity. In conclusion, in this in vitro LN model, leukemic cells affect importantly the MSC, inducing a senescence process that seems to favour leukemic cell growth.",,PMC6466857,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2595-4786', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5135-1714', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0237-3375']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is detected in 10% of myeloproliferative neoplasms, 4-5% of myelodysplastic syndromes, and 1-2% of acute myeloid leukaemia. Recurrent, non-random occurrence of del(20q) indicates that it is a pathogenic driver in myeloid malignancies. Genetic mapping of patient samples has identified two regions of interest on 20q - the ""Common Deleted Region"" (CDR) and ""Common Retained Region"" (CRR), which was often amplified. We proposed that the CDR contained tumor suppressor gene(s) (TSG) and the CRR harbored oncogene(s); loss of a TSG together with over-expression of an oncogene favored development of myeloid malignancies. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor T (PTPRT) and Hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK) were identified to be the likely candidate TSG and oncogene respectively. Retroviral transduction of HCK into PTPRT-null murine LKS+ stem and progenitor cells resulted in hyperproliferation in colony forming assays and hyperphosphorylation of intracellular STAT3. Furthermore, over half of the murine recipients of these transduced cells developed erythroid hyperplasia, polycythemia and splenomegaly at 12 months, although no leukemic phenotype was observed. The findings suggested that HCK amplification coupled with PTPRT loss in del(20q) leads to development of a myeloproliferative phenotype.",,PMC6505535,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0294-5051', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4784-9031', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4965-7148', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6593-3168']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, we identify seven MS-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) of which we validate two, including a region in the TMEM232 promoter and ZBTB16 enhancer. In CD4 + T cells we find an MS-associated differentially methylated region in FIRRE. Additionally, 45 regions show large methylation differences in individual pairs, but they do not clearly associate with MS. Furthermore, we present epigenetic biomarkers for current interferon-beta treatment, and extensive validation shows that the ZBTB16 DMP is a signature for prior glucocorticoid treatment.

Despite trends in improved survival due to better supportive care, up to 40% of patients will have refractory disease, which has a poorly understood biology and carries a dismal prognosis. The development of effective treatment strategies has been hindered by a general lack of knowledge about mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. Here, through transcriptomic analysis of 154 cases of treatment-naive AML, three chemorefractory patient groups with distinct expression profiles are identified. A classifier, four key refractory gene signatures (RG4), trained based on the expression profile of the highest risk refractory patients, validated in an independent cohort (n = 131), was prognostic for overall survival (OS) and refined an established 17-gene stemness score. Refractory subpopulations have differential expression in pathways involved in cell cycle, transcription, translation, metabolism, and/or stem cell properties. Ex vivo drug sensitivity to 122 small-molecule inhibitors revealed effective group-specific targeting of pathways among these three refractory groups. Gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing had a suboptimal ability to correctly predict those individuals resistant to conventional cytotoxic induction therapy, but could risk-stratify for OS and identify subjects most likely to have superior responses to a specific alternative therapy.

Epub 2019 May 7.,"Recent studies suggest that targeting transcriptional machinery can lead to potent and selective anticancer effects in cancers dependent on high and constant expression of certain transcription factors for growth and survival. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase complex. Its function is required for both cell-cycle regulation and transcriptional control of gene expression. CDK7 has recently emerged as an attractive cancer target because its inhibition leads to decreased transcript levels of oncogenic transcription factors, especially those associated with super-enhancers. Here, we describe a selective CDK7 inhibitor SY-1365, which is currently in clinical trials in populations of patients with ovarian and breast cancer (NCT03134638). In vitro, SY-1365 inhibited cell growth of many different cancer types at nanomolar concentrations. SY-1365 treatment decreased MCL1 protein levels, and cancer cells with low BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) expression were found to be more sensitive to SY-1365. Transcriptional changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines were distinct from those following treatment with other transcriptional inhibitors. SY-1365 demonstrated substantial antitumor effects in multiple AML xenograft models as a single agent; SY-1365-induced growth inhibition was enhanced in combination with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Antitumor activity was also observed in xenograft models of ovarian cancer, suggesting the potential for exploring SY-1365 in the clinic in both hematologic and solid tumors. Our findings support targeting CDK7 as a new approach for treating transcriptionally addicted cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the molecular mechanism of action and potent antitumor activity of SY-1365, the first selective CDK7 inhibitor to enter clinical investigation.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4321-0038', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7586-2356']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 7.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high-risk disease with a poor prognosis, particularly in elderly patients. Because current AML treatment relies primarily on untargeted therapies with severe side effects that limit patient eligibility, identification of novel therapeutic AML targets is highly desired. We recently described AT1413, an antibody produced by donor B cells of a patient with AML cured after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. AT1413 binds CD43s, a unique sialylated epitope on CD43, which is weakly expressed on normal myeloid cells and overexpressed on AML cells. Because of its selectivity for AML cells, we considered CD43s as a target for a bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody (bTCE) and generated a bTCE by coupling AT1413 to two T-cell-targeting fragments using chemo-enzymatic linkage. In vitro, AT1413 bTCE efficiently induced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity toward different AML cell lines and patient-derived AML blasts, whereas endothelial cells with low binding capacity for AT1413 remained unaffected. In the presence of AML cells, AT1413 bTCE induced upregulation of T-cell activation markers, cytokine release, and T-cell proliferation. AT1413 bTCE was also effective in vivo. Mice either coinjected with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells [human immune system (HIS) mice] were inoculated with an AML cell line or patient-derived primary AML blasts. AT1413 bTCE treatment strongly inhibited tumor growth and, in HIS mice, had minimal effects on normal human hematopoietic cells. Taken together, our results indicate that CD43s is a promising target for T-cell-engaging antibodies and that AT1413 holds therapeutic potential in a bTCE-format. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings offer preclinical evidence for the therapeutic potential of a bTCE antibody that targets a sialylated epitope on CD43 in AML.",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1330-5885', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1014-2593', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7939-9461']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 7.,"On November 21, 2018, the FDA approved glasdegib (Daurismo; Pfizer), a small-molecule Hedgehog inhibitor, in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults >/= 75 years or with comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Evidence of clinical benefit came from Study BRIGHT AML 1003, a randomized trial comparing glasdegib+LDAC with LDAC alone for treatment of newly diagnosed AML in 115 patients either >/= 75 years old or >/= 55 years old with preexisting comorbidities. Efficacy was established by improved overall survival (OS) with the combination compared with LDAC alone (HR, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.71; one-sided stratified log-rank P = 0.0002). Median OS was 8.3 months with the combination and 4.3 months with LDAC alone. Common adverse reactions included cytopenias, fatigue, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, dyspnea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, mucositis, constipation, and rash. The label includes a boxed warning for embryo-fetal toxicity and a warning for QT interval prolongation. There is a limitation of use for patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic and severe renal impairment; trials studying glasdegib in these patient populations are required as a condition of this approval.See related commentary by Fathi, p. 6015.",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8659-1240'],['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Oct 15;25(20):6015-6017.

Epub 2019 May 7.,"Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are hematological cancers that can be subdivided into entities with distinct clinical features. Somatic mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL have been described as drivers of the disease, together with a variable landscape of nondriver mutations. Despite detailed knowledge of disease mechanisms, targeted therapies effective enough to eliminate MPN cells are still missing. In this study of 113 MPN patients, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of the granulocyte transcriptome using RNA sequencing data and subsequently examine the applicability of immunotherapeutic strategies for MPN patients. Following implementation of customized workflows and data filtering, we identified a total of 13 (12/13 novel) gene fusions, 231 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants, and 21 insertions and deletions in 106 of 113 patients. We found a high frequency of SF3B1-mutated primary myelofibrosis patients (14%) with distinct 3' splicing patterns, many of these with a protein-altering potential. Finally, from all mutations detected, we generated a virtual peptide library and used NetMHC to predict 149 unique neoantigens in 62% of MPN patients. Peptides from CALR and MPL mutations provide a rich source of neoantigens as a result of their unique ability to bind many common MHC class I molecules. Finally, we propose that mutations derived from splicing defects present in SF3B1-mutated patients may offer an unexplored neoantigen repertoire in MPNs. We validated 35 predicted peptides to be strong MHC class I binders through direct binding of predicted peptides to MHC proteins in vitro. Our results may serve as a resource for personalized vaccine or adoptive cell-based therapy development.",['P 29018/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC6624966,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4299-7657', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2975-8969', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7420-3298', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7572-9504', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7698-5526', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2260-4935', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1583-6404', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6091-3088']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Jul 11;134(2):108-109.

These motifs are highly similar (stereotyped) within one third of CLL patients and create homogeneous groups called stereotyped CLL subsets. The homogeneity is reflected also in clinical and biological characteristics of the disease. To facilitate access to the information about individual subsets, we have created a publicly available web-based tool Encyclopedia of CLL Subsets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Encyclopedia of CLL subsets belongs to our bioinformatics platform Antigen Receptor Research Tool (ARResT) developed for analysis, clustering, and annotation of immunoglobulin sequences. To gather primary knowledge about the subsets, we have analyzed a dataset of 7,500 CLL patients published by Agathangelidis et al in 2012 [1]. We have created an overview of major stereotyped subsets and their characteristics. Additional clinical and cytogenomic information about individual subsets has been obtained by machine text processing of available literature from server PubMed and is regularly updated. RESULTS: We have created a unique web-based application Encyclopedia of CLL Subsets available from http: //arrest.tools/subsets for an interactive access to the information about stereotyped CLL subsets. A user can obtain and compare basic information about the major subsets including their clinical and cytogenomic characteristics. These have been manually curated from machine processed results from PubMed database by experts in CLL research. Through the Encyclopedias user interface, user can also directly use our published tool ARResT/AssignSubsets to assign new immunoglobulin sequences to the major subsets. CONCLUSION: The Encyclopedia of CLL Subsets is a publicly available online tool facilitating access to the most recent research knowledge about stereotyped CLL subsets and enabling analysis of own data and interpretation of the results. This gives the Encyclopedia a great potential for its use in clinical routine. This work was supported by Czech Ministry of Health grant No. 34272A. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated the reliability of multiple BCR-ABL1 thresholds in predicting treatment outcomes for 184 subjects diagnosed with CML and treated with standard-dose imatinib mesylate (IM). With a median follow-up of 61 months, patients with concordant BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) transcripts below the defined thresholds (10% at 3 months and 1% at 6 months) displayed significantly superior rates of event-free survival (86.1% vs. 26.6%) and deep molecular response (>/= MR(4); 71.5% vs. 16.1%) compared to individuals with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) levels above these defined thresholds. We then analyzed the outcomes of subjects displaying discordant molecular transcripts at 3- and 6-month time points. Among these patients, those with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) values >10% at 3 months but <1% at 6 months fared significantly better than individuals with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) <10% at 3 months but >1% at 6 months (event-free survival 68.2% vs. 32.7%; p < 0.001). Likewise, subjects with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) at 3 months >10% but <1% at 6 months showed a higher cumulative incidence of MR(4) compared to patients with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) <10% at 3 months but >1% at 6 months (75% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.001). Finally, lower BCR-ABL1/GUS(IS) transcripts at diagnosis were associated with BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) values <1% at 6 months (p < 0.001).

Although the curative rates have significantly improved over the past 10 years, especially in pediatric patients, T-ALL remains a challenge from a therapeutic point of view, due to the high number of early relapses that are for the most part resistant to further treatment. Considerable advances in the understanding of the genes, signaling networks, and mechanisms that play crucial roles in the pathobiology of T-ALL have led to the identification of the key drivers of the disease, thereby paving the way for new therapeutic approaches. PTEN is critical to prevent the malignant transformation of T-cells. However, its expression and functions are altered in human T-ALL. PTEN is frequently deleted or mutated, while PTEN protein is often phosphorylated and functionally inactivated by casein kinase 2. Different murine knockout models recapitulating the development of T-ALL have demonstrated that PTEN abnormalities are at the hub of an intricate oncogenic network sustaining and driving leukemia development by activating several signaling cascades associated with drug-resistance and poor outcome. These aspects and their possible therapeutic implications are highlighted in this review.",['#111104 and #111110-668715-0000./East Carolina University'],PMC6562458,,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/Akt/mTOR', 'genetic anomalies', 'lipid phosphatase', 'prognosis', 'targeted therapy']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5196-7260'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of maternal subclinical hypothyroidism during early pregnancy on abortion in the uterus, focusing upon the LIF/STAT3 signaling pathway. Methods: One hundred five Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (35 rats in each group): control (CON) group, subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) group and overt hypothyroidism (OH) group. We examined the weight of rat uteri, rat placenta and embryos. We also determined the number of implantation sites and the embryo absorption rates. The protein and mRNA expressions of TSHR, TR-alpha, TR-beta, LIFR, gp130, JAK1, p-STAT3 and STAT3 were measured by immunohistochemical staining, real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results: The weights of rat uteri, rat placenta and embryos were significantly reduced in the SCH and OH groups. The number of implantation sites was significantly decreased in the SCH and OH groups, while embryo absorption rates were significantly increased. The mRNA and protein expressions of TSHR were upregulated in the SCH and OH groups, while TR-alpha and TR-beta showed no difference when compared between the three groups. The expression levels of LIFR, gp130, JAK1 and p-STAT3 were significantly higher in the SCH and OH groups. Conclusions: Clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism during early pregnancy might cause adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Epub 2019 May 4.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer that remains lethal to the majority of sufferers. Whilst the mainstay treatments for this condition have remained largely unchanged over the past five decades, progress in deciphering its pathogenesis has accelerated in recent years, propelled in part by advances in cancer genomics and mechanistic studies of leukemogenic mutations. Newer molecular therapies targeting aberrant biological pathways are currently under investigation with a few moving closer to clinical use. However, collectively, these new therapies are not predicted to have a major impact on clinical outcomes and the need for the identification of further therapeutic targets in AML remains critical. Recently the use of CRISPR-Cas9 systems for genome editing and their potential application in genome-wide screening has opened a new frontier for unbiased discovery of therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer and AML was the first disease in which this technology was systematically applied. In this review we give an overview of recent advances in identifying novel therapeutic vulnerabilities of AML using CRISPR-Cas9 and discuss possible future applications of CRISPR technologies in this field.","['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'C22324/A23015/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 4.,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This disease is characterized by uncontrolled growth and proliferation of abnormal cells with a high probability to develop metastasis. Recently, it was demonstrated that perezone, a sesquiterpene quinone, is capable to induce cell death in leukemia (K562), prostate (PC-3), colorectal (HCT-15) and lung (SKLU-1) cancer cell lines; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Therefore, in this study, in vitro and computational studies were performed to determine the mechanism of action of perezone. Firstly, changes in K562cell viability, as well as changes in the redox status of the cell in response to treatment with several concentrations of perezone were analyzed. The type of cell death induced, and the modification of the cell cycle were determined. In addition, MD simulations and docking studies were performed to investigate the interaction of perezone with seven regulators of the apoptotic process. Finally, the ability of perezone to inhibit PARP-1 was evaluated by in vitro studies. K562 cells treated with perezone exhibited decreased viability and more oxidized status, being this effect concentration-dependent. In addition, the increase of G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and apoptosis were observed. According to the performed computational studies conducted, perezone showed the highest affinity to PARP-1 enzyme being this complex the most stable due to the presence of a small and deep cavity in the active site, which allows perezone to fit deeply by forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which drive this interaction. The activity of perezone as PARP-1 inhibitor was corroborated with an IC50=181.5muM. The pro-apoptotic action of perezone may be related to PARP-1 inhibition and changes in the redox state of the cell. The obtained results allowed to understand the biological effect of perezone and, consequently, these could be employed to develop novel PARP-1 inhibitors.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell cycle', '*Docking studies', '*Molecular dynamics simulations', '*PARP-1', '*Perezone', '*ROS production']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

However, for wide adoption of this technology in clinical and commercial space, it requires scalable models for executing viral validation studies. In this study, viral validation studies were conducted under cGLP guidelines to assess retro- (X-MuLV) and parvo-virus (MVM) clearance across twin-column continuous capture chromatography (CaptureSMB). A surrogate model was also developed using standard batch mode chromatography based on flow path modifications to mimic the loading strategy used in CaptureSMB. The results show that a steady state was achieved by the second cycle for both antibody binding and virus clearance and that the surrogate model using batch mode chromatography equipment provided impurity clearance that was comparable to that obtained during cyclical operation of CaptureSMB. Further, the log reduction values (LRVs) achieved during CaptureSMB were also comparable to the LRVs obtained using standard batch capture chromatography. This was expected since the mode of virus separation during protein A chromatography is primarily based on removal during the flow through and wash steps.

We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of three regimens in AML patients refractory to the first course of standard induction regimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The three regimens consisted of (1) High-dose cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (HD-CAG) regimen (n = 44); (2) intermediate/high-dose cytarabine (I/HDAC) regimen (n = 30); and (3) standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) combination regimen that was identical to the first course of standard induction regimen (n = 27). RESULTS: Results indicated that after the second course, the overall response (OR), i.e., complete remission [CR]+partial remission [PR]) rates in HD-CAG was higher than in the I/HDAC group (84.1% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.009), whereas the CR rates among 3 groups were not statistically different (P = 0.541). Meanwhile, the proportion of subjects reporting certain adverse effects in the HD-CAG group was lower than the I/HDAC or SDAC groups. There were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates among the 3 groups (P = 0.881 and P = 0.872, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that HD-CAG regimen may represent a better alternative option for AML patients with NR after the first course of standard induction chemotherapy.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'high-dose CAG', 'induction remission', 'non-remission', 're-induction regimen']",,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, B lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients were divided into groups according to different standards. By course of disease: newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR), consolidation (CONS). By stratification: high risk (HR), standard risk (SR). By minimal residual disease (MRD): MRD positive(MRD+), MRD negative (MRD-). The proportion of plasmacytoid DC(pDC) and myeloid DC(mDC) were compared within these standards. The costimulatory molecule levels of pDC, mDC in ND and CR were measured and the function of peripheral blood monocyte-derived DC(MoDC)s were examined. We found proportions of pDC and mDC in ND were both lower compared to control group and gradually increased after CR. In HR and MRD+, the proportions were also lower compared to SR and MRD- at CR stage, respectively; but there were no difference between these comparisons when newly diagnosed. In ND, both CD80, CD86 levels in pDC, mDC were higher while the levels in activated MoDCs were lower when compared to control and CR group, respectively. The dextran uptake of MoDCs, T cell proliferation promoting ability, IL-12, BAFF, INF-alpha levels in supernatant and their mRNA relative expression in activated MoDCs in ND were also lower than those in control and CR group. So, DCs in B-ALL display suppressed status in phenotype and functionwhich would be gradually restored after effective chemotherapy. pDC and mDC could respond to patient condition, DCs proportion may be useful for monitoring disease progression.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dendritic cells', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'costimulatory molecules', 'minimal residual disease']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3697-2138'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QRT-PCR results showed that SBF2-AS1 expression was upregulated in AML cells. CCK-8 assay revealed that SBF2-AS1 inhibition decreased AML cells proliferation ability in vitro. Flow cytometry assays showed that SBF2-AS1 inhibition induced AML cells apoptosis and arrested AML cells in G0/G1 phase. Mechanistically, miR-188-5p was identified as a direct target of SBF2-AS1. SBF2-AS1 upregulated the expression level of ZFP91 by sponging miR-188-5p. And the effects of SBF2-AS1 suppression on AML cells progression could be abolished by miR-188-5p inhibitors.

However, the underlying mechanisms and mediators remain unclear. Here, we showed that mice injected with CML-derived exosomes had significant weight loss and great drop of body fat rate. In the meanwhile, we found that CML-derived exosomes could be taken up by adipose tissue, and, in turn, suppressed the adipogenic ability of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). By RNA sequencing, miR-92a-3p was found highly expressed in both CML cells and the derivative exosomes. Mechanistically, miR-92a-3p inhibited adipogenesis of ADSCs via posttranscriptionally decreasing C/EBPalpha expression when transferred into the ADSCs with the exosomes, and encapsulating miR-92a-3p inhibitor into CML exosomes blocked the antiadipogenic effects of CML exosomes. In addition, we also found that miR-92a-3p was highly expressed in exosomes from some other types of cancers that cause cachexia.

Along with more specialized progenitor cells, HSCs have an essential role in maintaining a healthy blood system. Incorrect regulation of cell fate decisions in stem/progenitor cells can lead to an imbalance of mature blood cell populations-a situation seen in diseases such as leukemia. Transcription factors, acting as part of complex regulatory networks, are known to play an important role in regulating hematopoietic cell fate decisions. Yet, discovering the interactions present in these networks remains a big challenge. Here, we discuss a computational method that uses single-cell gene expression data to reconstruct Boolean gene regulatory network models and show how this technique can be applied to enhance our understanding of transcriptional regulation in hematopoiesis.","['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Boolean network', '*Gene regulatory network', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell', '*Pseudotime', '*Single cell', '*Transcriptional regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, combining Raman spectrum and spectral imaging, both the biochemical changes of BBR-induced Jurkat cell apoptosis and the precise distribution of BBR in single cell are presented. In contrast, we also show the corresponding results of Jatrorrhizine (JTZ) and Palmatine (PMT), two structural analogues of BBR. It is found that all three structural analogues can induce cell apoptosis by breaking DNA and the main action sites are located in phosphate backbone and base pair groups, but their action on cell cycle are different, in which BBR leads to the S phase arrest while JTZ and PMT are on the G2 phase arrest. Moreover, from the Raman spectra of DNA treated with different drugs, we find that the content of phosphate backbone and base pair groups in BBR-treated DNA are larger than those in JTZ or PMT. And this result reflects the strong capability of BBR breaking DNA backbone relative to JTZ or PMT, suggesting that the existence of methylene-dioxy on the 2, 3 units of A ring on the quinoline ring can greatly enhance the capability of BBR breaking DNA backbone, so the action effect of BBR-induced Jurkat cell apoptosis is better than those of PMT or JTZ. Further, by using Raman spectral imaging approach, we achieve the precise distribution of BBR in single cell, it is found that the receptor-mediated BBR targeting delivery based single-wall carbon nanotube and folic acid (SWNT/FA) reveals excellent performance in BBR targeting delivery relative to the conventional BBR diffusion approach. Importantly, these results demonstrate that Raman spectrum and spectral imaging should be a powerful tool to study the molecular mechanism of drug-induced cell apoptosis and evaluate the efficiency of drug delivery system.",,PMC6484975,,,,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest related to this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we compiled quantities of case history to evaluate the current available evidence of herbal Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, RSM) formulae for the treatment of cancer by means of the high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: English and Chinese electronic databases were searched from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, Wanfang database until September 2018. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by using the method of Cocharne evidence-based medicine system evaluation, the quality was evaluated by screening the literature that met the requirements, and the Review Manager 5.3 was used for statistical analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs was used to estimate the correlation between Danshen formulae and therapeutic effects. Results: Thirteen RCTs with 1045 participants were identified. The studies investigated the lung cancer (n = 5), leukemia (n = 3), liver cancer (n = 3), breast or colon cancer (n = 1), and gastric cancer (n = 1). A total of 83 traditional Chinese medicines were used in all prescriptions and there were 3 different dosage forms. Meta-analysis suggested that Danshen formulae had a significant effect on RR (response rate) (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.66-3.42), 1-year survival (OR 1.70 95% CI 1.22-2.36), 3-year survival (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.62-4.78), and 5-year survival (OR 8.45, 95% CI 2.53-28.27).

Recent studies have demonstrated that treatment free remission is possible in certain patients. The aim of this study was to characterise a real-world population in terms of response to therapy, treatment intolerance and potential eligibility for stopping treatment. Included were 105 CML patients diagnosed in Northern Ireland from March 2009-February 2018. Response to treatment was defined as per the 2009 and 2013 European Leukaemia Net guidelines. Potential for treatment cessation was assessed as per the 2017 UK Interim Expert Opinion on Discontinuing Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment in Clinical Practice for Treatment-Free Remission in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia. Our cytogenetic data cohort had a 12-month complete cytogenetic response rate of 66% and the molecular data cohort had a 12-month major molecular response rate of 38%. Of those commenced on 2(nd) line TKI therapy 81% achieved an optimal response at 12 months. Twenty-two patients developed intolerance and required a change in TKI therapy. The commonest side effects were gastro-intestinal upset (18%), transaminitis (16%) and fluid retention (16%). In our cohort, 20% were considered eligible to stop TKI therapy. The commonest reason for ineligibility was insufficient duration of therapy (25%). We observed that 1(st) and 2(nd) line TKI therapy are effective but problems with failure and intolerance persist. Additionally, this study identifies a cohort of patients who may attempt TKI cessation using the UK Interim Expert Opinion report on TKI therapy discontinuation.",,PMC6500416,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'TKI', 'intolerance', 'real-world', 'treatment cessation']",,,['Provenance: externally peer reviewed'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, male HIV/AIDS patients died 22.5 years earlier and female HIV/AIDS patients 15 years earlier than did the general population.

Epub 2019 Apr 26.,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic outcomes for childhood malignancy have dramatically improved. However, secondary malignancies are a major concern, as they greatly affect the quality of life of survivors. This retrospective study evaluated the cumulative incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of secondary malignancies at Nippon Medical School Hospital. METHODS: We examined data from 275 cases of primary childhood malignancy diagnosed between 1980 and 2014. Information regarding treatment of the primary malignancy, including irradiation dose, site, and cumulative dose of anticancer drugs, was assessed. We also collected data on secondary malignancy, including patient sex, age at diagnosis, malignancy site, time from primary to secondary malignancy, and outcomes. RESULTS: Secondary malignancies developed in 11 patients and included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (4), meningioma (4), Ewing sarcoma (1), germ cell tumor (1), and malignant parotid gland tumor (1). The primary malignancies included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (9), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1) and brain tumor (1). In 7 of the 9 ALL patients, chemoradiotherapy was the primary treatment. The meningiomas and 1 solid tumor developed within the radiation field. All AMLs and meningiomas developed within 5 years and after 20 years, respectively, of the primary diagnosis. The 10- and 20-year cumulative incidence rates for secondary malignancy in our hospital were 1.9% and 5.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the type of secondary malignancy depends on the interval after the end of treatment for primary malignancy.

Epub 2019 May 6.,"PURPOSE: Myelofibrosis is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, atypical megakaryocytes, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications, and a risk of evolution to acute leukemia. The JAK kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib provides therapeutic benefit, but the effects are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether targeting AURKA, which has been shown to increase maturation of atypical megakaryocytes, has potential benefit for patients with myelofibrosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with myelofibrosis were enrolled in a phase I study at three centers. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of alisertib. Correlative studies involved assessment of the effect of alisertib on the megakaryocyte lineage, allele burden, and fibrosis. RESULTS: In addition to being well tolerated, alisertib reduced splenomegaly and symptom burden in 29% and 32% of patients, respectively, despite not consistently reducing the degree of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, alisertib normalized megakaryocytes and reduced fibrosis in 5 of 7 patients for whom sequential marrows were available. Alisertib also decreased the mutant allele burden in a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations of ruxolitinib, novel therapies are needed for myelofibrosis. In this study, alisertib provided clinical benefit and exhibited the expected on-target effect on the megakaryocyte lineage, resulting in normalization of these cells and reduced fibrosis in the majority of patients for which sequential marrows were available. Thus, AURKA inhibition should be further developed as a therapeutic option in myelofibrosis.See related commentary by Piszczatowski and Steidl, p. 4868.",,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0355-6368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6919-0231']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Aug 15;25(16):4868-4870.

Epub 2019 May 3.,"BACKGROUND: Guadecitabine is a next-generation hypomethylating agent whose active metabolite decitabine has a longer in-vivo exposure time than intravenous decitabine. More effective hypomethylating agents are needed for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. In the present study, we aimed to compare the activity and safety of two doses of guadecitabine in hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or relapsed or refractory patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: This phase 2 part of the phase 1/2, randomised, open-label study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older from 14 North American medical centres with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1-risk, intermediate-2-risk, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. They were either hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or had relapsed or refractory disease after previous hypomethylating agent treatment as determined by the investigators' judgment. Eligible patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer algorithm for dynamic randomisation to subcutaneous guadecitabine 60 or 90 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment was stratified by previous treatment with hypomethylating agents and neither patients nor investigators were masked. The primary endpoint was overall response (a composite of complete response, partial response, marrow complete response, and haematological improvement) assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. FINDINGS: Between July 9, 2012, and April 7, 2014, 105 patients were enrolled: 55 (52%) were allocated to guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) (28 patients were treatment-naive and 27 had relapsed or refractory disease after previous hypomethylating agent treatment) and 50 (48%) patients to 90 mg/m(2) (23 patients were treatment-naive and 27 had relapsed or refractory disease). Three (3%) patients of 105 did not receive study treatment and were excluded from analyses. Median follow-up was 3.2 years (IQR 2.8-3.5). The proportion of patients achieving an overall response did not significantly differ between dose groups (21 of 53 [40%, 95% CI 27-54] with 60 mg/m(2) and 27 of 49 [55%, 95% CI 40-69] with 90 mg/m(2); p=0.16). 25 of 49 (51%, 95% CI 36-66) patients who were treatment-naive and 23 of 53 (43%, 30-58) patients with relapsed or refractory disease achieved an overall response. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in both groups, regardless of relationship to treatment, were thrombocytopenia (22 [41%] of 53 patients in the 60 mg/m(2) group and 28 [57%] of 49 in the 90 mg/m(2) group), neutropaenia (21 [40%] and 25 [51%]), anaemia (25 [47%] and 24 [49%]), febrile neutropaenia (17 [32%] and 21 [43%]), and pneumonia (13 [25%] and 15 [31%]). Seven (7%) of 102 patients died due to adverse events (three with 90 mg/m(2) and four with 60 mg/m(2)), and all except one were in the relapsed or refractory cohort. Two deaths were deemed treatment related (septic shock with 60 mg/m(2); pneumonia with 90 mg/m(2)). INTERPRETATION: Guadecitabine was clinically active with acceptable tolerability in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Responses and overall survival in the relapsed or refractory cohort offer the potential of a new therapeutic option for patients for whom currently available hypomethylating agents are not successful. We therefore recommend guadecitabine at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) on a 5-day schedule for these patients.

Epub 2019 Apr 2.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) has reached unprecedented success leading to survival rates reaching 90%. This is regrettably linked to increased risk of developing long-term health-related sequels into early adulthood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at assessing the relationship between the vitamin D status and metabolic biomarkers in PETALE, a well-characterized cohort of cALL survivors. RESULTS: We demonstrate that 15.9% of the study participants exhibited 3 or more metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. We also show a direct relationship between s25OHD3 and plasma HDL-Cholesterol concentrations in female but not male participants. CONCLUSION: Our data, from a metabolically well-described cohort, support a modest role for vitamin D in lipid metabolism in childhood leukemia survivors. The major outcome of this study is the strong association between HDL-Cholesterol concentration and s25OHD3 only in female subjects, thereby conveying vitamin D a gender-specific cardio-protective effect. cALL survivors represent a population at higher risk for secondary diseases.

To date, two DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi), 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), are approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, they are chemically instable and quite toxic for healthy cells; thus, the discovery of novel DNMTi is urgent. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of a new quinoline-based molecule, MC3353, as a non-nucleoside inhibitor and downregulator of DNMT. This compound was able, in promoter demethylating assays, to induce enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene expression in HCT116 cells and transcription in a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven luciferase reporter system in KG-1 cells. Moreover, MC3353 displayed a strong antiproliferative activity when tested on HCT116 colon cancer cells after 48 h of treatment at 0.5 muM. At higher doses, this compound provided a cytotoxic effect in double DNMT knockout HCT116 cells. MC3353 was also screened on a different panel of cancer cells (KG-1 and U-937 acute myeloid leukemia, RAJI Burkitt's lymphoma, PC-3 prostate cancer, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer), where it arrested cell proliferation and reduced viability after 48 h of treatment with IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 muM. Compared to healthy cell models, MC3353 induced apoptosis (e.g., U-937 and KG-1 cells) or necrosis (e.g., RAJI cells) at lower concentrations. Importantly, together with the main DNMT3A enzyme inhibition, MC3353 was also able to downregulate the DNMT3A protein level in selected HCT116 and PC-3 cell lines. Additionally, this compound provided impairment of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inducing E-cadherin while reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) mRNA and protein levels in PC-3 and HCT116 cells. Last, tested on a panel of primary osteosarcoma cell lines, MC3353 markedly inhibited cell growth with low single-digit micromolar IC50 ranging from 1.1 to 2.4 muM. Interestingly, in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, MC3353 induced both expression of genes and mineralized the matrix as evidence of osteosarcoma to osteoblast differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The present work describes MC3353 as a novel DNMTi displaying a stronger in cell demethylating ability than both 5-AZA and DAC, providing re-activation of the silenced ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) gene. MC3353 displayed dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell types, inducing cell death and affecting EMT through E-cadherin and MMP2 modulation. In addition, this compound proved efficacy even in primary osteosarcoma cell models, through the modulation of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation.",['R01 GM114306/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6501426,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*DNMT inhibitor', '*Epigenetics', '*Gene expression', '*Quinoline-based compound']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2241-607X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 7.,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential as novel diagnostic or therapeutic tools in biomedicine but, cellular toxicity must be well considered before widespread application of CNTs. Many chemical agents exert their toxicity through apoptotic pathways by induction of caspase biomolecules. In the current study, effects of carboxyl-functionalized single-walled (SW) and multi-walled (MW) CNTs at a single dose of 100 microg ml(-1) on the survival of Jurkat cells were examined using MTT assay. Additionally, the impacts of carboxylated CNTs on the gene expression levels of selected caspases were investigated. Jurkat cells were exposed to CNTs (100 microg ml(-1) for 72 h) and then expression levels of selected caspase genes (Cas) were evaluated by qRT-PCR analysis. Housekeeping genes, beta-actin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were used as normalization controls. The results showed only a mild decrease in the viability of Jurkat cells treated with carboxylated MWCNT. The results of qRT-PCR analysis revealed the elevated level of Cas2 mRNA in the cells treated with carboxylated MWCNT (6.08-fold) and carboxylated SWCNT (1.20-fold). The expression levels of Cas4, Cas6, Cas8, and Cas10 genes were increased not significantly compared to the control untreated cells. Our findings suggested that exposure to carboxyl-functionalized CNTs could be resulted in up-regulation of the Cas2 gene and not initiator Cas8 and Cas10 genes. In addition, it seems that carboxylated MWCNT was more potent than SWCNT in activation of Cas2 gene expression and triggering cell death signal in a manner different from intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis pathways.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Carbon nanotubes', 'Jurkat cell', 'apoptosis', 'caspase family', 'viability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 28.,"Autophagy is primarily considered as an important survival mechanism for both normal cells and cancer cells in response to metabolic stress or chemotherapy; but the role of autophagy in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to explore the role of intrinsic autophagy in the leukemogenesis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In this study, conditional knockout mice Atg7(f/f);Ubc-Cre, in which an autophagy-essential gene Atg7 is universally deleted, were used as recipients, B-ALL cell line 697 was used as donor cells to generate leukemia mouse model. Compared to wild-type mice, Atg7 knockout mice were more susceptible to engrafted leukemogenesis, shown by increase in white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets, decrease in HSPC number and its colony-forming unit (CFU). The liver and spleen displayed hepatosplenomegaly and inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, second competitive transplantation revealed dysfunction of the HSPC in Atg7-knockout leukemia mice represented by destructive self-renew ability (CFU) and reconstitution ability including decreased B220, Ter 119 cells, and increased Gr-1 cell percentage. In summary, Mice with universal deletion of Atg7 are more inclined to the occurrence of engrafted human leukemia, which is largely attributed to the deterioration of the function of HSPC in autophagy deficient mice.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*Conditional knock out mice', '*Engrafted leukemia', '*Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

There is little evidence regarding optimal transfusion targets in these highly transfusion-dependent patient populations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective pre-post cohort study of consecutive patients admitted to Kingston Health Sciences Center between April through December 2016 (pre) and April through December 2017 (post) for acute leukemia induction chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The pre-cohort was transfused using a liberal threshold (2 units of RBCs for Hb </=80 g/L) and the post-cohort using a more restrictive threshold (1 unit RBCs for Hb </=70 g/L), implemented with a computerized physician order entry form. Primary outcome was number of RBC units transfused per inpatient day. Secondary outcomes included inpatient mortality and select morbidity measures. RESULTS: 124 patients underwent 134 treatment courses: 62 courses of induction chemotherapy (pre = 26, post = 36) and 72 courses of HDCT for ASCT (pre = 39, post = 33). There was a significant decrease in median RBC utilization per admission in both patient populations: 10.5 versus 6.7 in the leukemia group (p = 0.01) and 2.0 versus 1.0 in the ASCT group (p = 0.04). This reduction was seen without a difference in inpatient mortality, length of stay, falls, serious bleeds, requirement for ICU, or time to engraftment post ASCT. CONCLUSIONS: A restrictive transfusion strategy in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or ASCT decreased inpatient RBC usage without increasing adverse inpatient events.",,,,,,,['(c) 2019 AABB.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asparaginase is known to potentiate both the antileukemic and osteonecrosis-inducing effects of dexamethasone. The schedule of dexamethasone alters osteonecrosis risk. However, the effects of the interaction with asparaginase are unknown when dexamethasone is given on a discontinuous schedule. METHODS: Using the murine model of osteonecrosis, we compared the frequency of osteonecrosis in mice receiving discontinuous dexamethasone (3.5 days/ week) with mice receiving asparaginase and discontinuous dexamethasone. We then tested the effect on antileukemic efficacy using six pediatric ALL xenografts. RESULTS: The addition of asparaginase to discontinuous dexamethasone did not alter the rate of osteonecrosis compared to dexamethasone alone (7/35 in dexamethasone with asparaginase combination vs. 10/36 in dexamethasone alone, p = 0.62) despite increasing steady-state plasma dexamethasone levels (103.9 nM vs. 33.4 nM, p = 9.2x10-7). Combination therapy with asparaginase and dexamethasone demonstrated synergistic antileukemic effects across all six xenografts studied. CONCLUSIONS: When discontinuous dexamethasone was given, its anti-leukemic activity synergized with asparaginase but the osteonecrosis-worsening effects of asparaginase (above dexamethasone alone) were not observed. Thus, there is a favorable drug interaction (unchanged toxicity, synergistic efficacy) between discontinuous dexamethasone and asparaginase.","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6502315,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8113-8180'],,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: MVR has received research funding from Servier.

Epub 2019 Apr 8.,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) modulates various biological processes. Although previous studies have described the effects of LIF on adipocyte differentiation, the role of LIF receptor (LIFR) on adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Using reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR (RTqPCR), LIFR expression was demonstrated to increase during adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), indicating that LIFR may be involved in this process. To further evaluate the association between LIFR and adipogenic differentiation, lentivirusmediated LIFR knockdown was performed in hMSCs. Cells were divided into two groups: Negative control group and LIFRknockdown group. During the adipogenic differentiation process, intracellular lipid accumulation was assessed with Oil Red O staining at various time points (days 3, 6 and 9). Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of LIF, LIFR and three molecular indicators of adipogenesis, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2), were assessed by RTqPCR and western blotting. The culture supernatant was collected to evaluate the concentration of LIF using ELISA. The present results suggested that LIFR expression progressively increased during adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Conversely, LIFR knockdown significantly suppressed this process. Additionally, PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and aP2 were inhibited following LIFR knockdown. In contrast with LIFR, the expression levels of LIF were significantly decreased after the initiation of adipogenic differentiation. Therefore, the expression levels of LIF and LIFR exhibited opposite trends. Collectively, the present results suggested that LIFR promoted adipogenic differentiation, whereas LIF may negatively regulate this process.",,PMC6522817,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to review the anti-AML effect of various natural compounds. Natural compounds were classified into five groups: alkaloids, carotenoids, nitrogen-containing compounds, organosulfur compounds or phenolics based on each compound's chemical properties. Fifty-eight studies were collected and reviewed in this article. Phenolics are the most abundant group to have an apoptotic effect over AML cells, while other groups have also shown significant apoptotic effects. Some compounds induced apoptosis by regulating unique mechanism like human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) or laminin receptor (67LR), while others modified caspases, poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and p53. Further study is required to identify side-effects of potent compounds and the synergistic effects of combination of two or more natural compounds or existing conventional anti-AML drugs to treat this dreadful disease.","['NRF-2016R1D1A1B03933656/the Basic Science Research Program through the National', 'Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education']",PMC6567155,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'alkaloids', 'apoptosis', 'carotenoids', 'natural products', 'nitrogen-containing compounds', 'organosulfur compounds', 'phenolics']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to perform multi-parametric analysis of living cells on a chip, we here developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging (SPRI)-impedance sensor that can detect both refractive index (RI) and impedance changes on a sensor chip with comb-shaped electrodes. We then investigated the potential of the sensor for label-free and real-time analysis of living cell reactions in response to stimuli. We cultured rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells on the sensor chip, which was a glass slide coated with comb-shaped electrodes, and detected activation of RBL-2H3 cells, such as degranulation and morphological changes, in response to a dinitro-phenol-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) antigen. Moreover, impedance analysis revealed that the changes of impedance derived from RBL-2H3 cell activation appeared in the range of 1 kHz-1 MHz. Furthermore, we monitored living cell-derived RI and impedance changes simultaneously on a sensor chip using the SPRI-impedance sensor. Thus, we developed a new technique to monitor both impedance and RI derived from living cells by using a comb-shaped electrode sensor chip. This technique may enable us to clarify complex living cell functions which affect the RI and impedance and apply this to medical applications, such as accurate clinical diagnosis of type I allergy.",,PMC6539035,,['NOTNLM'],"['RBL-2H3 cells', 'SPR imaging (SPRI) sensor', 'impedance sensor', 'multi-parametric cell analysis', 'surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1569-6034'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lack of testis-determination in the human results in 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. A minority of these cases is explained by mutations in genes known to be involved in sex-determination. Here, we identified a de novo missense mutation, p.Arg235Gln in the highly conserved TALE homeodomain of the transcription factor Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1 (PBX1) in a child with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and radiocubital synostosis. This mutation, within the nuclear localization signal of the protein, modifies the ability of the PBX1 protein to localize to the nucleus. The mutation abolishes the physical interaction of PBX1 with two proteins known to be involved in testis-determination, CBX2 and EMX2.

Thymoquinone (TQ), the major biologically active compound of black seed oil, has demonstrated anticancer activities in various tumors by targeting several pathways. However, its effects on the epigenetic code of cancer cells are largely unknown. In the present study, we performed RNA sequencing to investigate the anticancer mechanisms of TQ-treated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Jurkat cells) and examined gene expression using different tools. We found that many key epigenetic players, including ubiquitin-like containing plant homeodomain (PHD) and really interesting new gene (RING) finger domains 1 (UHRF1), DNMT1,3A,3B, G9A, HDAC1,4,9, KDM1B, and KMT2A,B,C,D,E, were downregulated in TQ-treated Jurkat cells. Interestingly, several TSGs, such as DLC1, PPARG, ST7, FOXO6, TET2, CYP1B1, SALL4, and DDIT3, known to be epigenetically silenced in various tumors, including acute leukemia, were upregulated, along with the upregulation of several downstream pro-apoptotic genes, such as RASL11B, RASD1, GNG3, BAD, and BIK. Data obtained from RNA sequencing were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in Jurkat cells, as well as in a human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468 cells). We found that the decrease in cell proliferation and in the expression of UHRF1, DNMT1, G9a, and HDAC1 genes in both cancer cell (Jurkat cells and MDA-MB-468 cells) lines depends on the TQ dose. Our results indicate that the use of TQ as an epigenetic drug represents a promising strategy for epigenetic therapy for both solid and blood tumors by targeting both DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications.",,PMC6452588,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Jurkat', 'RNA-seq', 'Thymoquinone', 'epigenetics', 'gene expression', 'tumor suppressor genes']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3275-0861', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3669-1184']",,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSCs are identified through expression of CD133 that is the most important surface marker of these cells. Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) is another colon CSCs marker. Other markers that are probably involved in colon tumorigenesis are Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled Receptor 5 (LGR5), B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) and Ten-Eleven Translocations (TETs). Methods: Here, mRNA expression rates of LGR5, BMI1 and TETs were surveyed by real-time PCR. After collection and digestion, colon samples were used to isolate CD133 and EpCAM positive CSCs through evaluation of AC133 EpCAM by Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) and flow cytometry. Real-time PCR was carried out for assessing expressions of LGR5, BMI1 and TETs. Results: High expressions for LGR5, BMI1, TET1 and TET2 in the CD133 and EpCAM positive CSCs (p</=0.05 vs. non-CSCs) were found. TET3, however, showed no significant changes for mRNA expression in the CSCs. Conclusion: In conclusion, high mRNA expressions for LGR5, BMI1, TET1 and TET2 in the CD133 and EpCAM positive CSCs may be a useful criterion for better identification of the cells involved in colon cancer in order to specify therapeutic targets against this type of cancer.",,PMC6490413,,['NOTNLM'],"['Colon', 'Flow cytometry', 'Molony murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplastic stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using genetic and chemical approaches, we showed that hyperactivation of the protease selectively kills cancer cells, independently of p53 status, by selective degradation of its respiratory chain protein substrates and disrupts mitochondrial structure and function, while it does not affect non-malignant cells. We identified imipridones as potent activators of ClpP. Through biochemical studies and crystallography, we show that imipridones bind ClpP non-covalently and induce proteolysis by diverse structural changes. Imipridones are presently in clinical trials.

This phase II multi-institution Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored study was conducted to determine efficacy and safety of the combination of the ATP-competitive pan-AKT inhibitor GSK2141795, targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in RAS-mutated relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients achieving a complete remission. Secondary objectives included assessment of toxicity profile and biologic effects of this combination. Twenty-three patients with RAS-mutated AML received the combination. Two dose levels were explored (dose level 1: 2 mg trametinib, 25 mg GSK2141795 and dose level 2: 1.5 mg trametinib, 50 mg GSK2141795). RESULTS: Dose level 1 was identified as the recommended phase II dose. No complete remissions were identified in either cohort. Minor responses were recognized in 5 (22%) patients. The most common drug-related toxicities included rash and diarrhea, with dose-limiting toxicities of mucositis and colitis. Longitudinal correlative assessment of the modulation of MEK and AKT pathways using reverse phase protein array and phospho-flow analysis revealed significant and near significant down-modulation of pERK and pS6, respectively. Combined MEK and AKT inhibition had no clinical activity in patients with RAS-mutated AML. CONCLUSION: Further investigation is required to explore the discrepancy between the activity of this combination on leukemia cells and the lack of clinical efficacy.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA221675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6626580,['NIHMS1525368'],['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Developmental therapeutics', '*Drug resistance', '*Neoplasia-myeloid leukemias and dysplasias', '*Phase II clinical trials']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Adipocytokines are key mediators in various complications of obesity. Our aim was to study the potential of adipocytokines to affect Sertoli cell function, which is crucial for spermatogenesis, and possibly link these findings to the observed attenuation of spermatogenesis in obese males. Testicular biopsies were obtained from healthy donors. Highly purified adult human Sertoli cells (HSCs) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of adipocytokines (10-1000ngmL-1) for 2-7 days. Expression of selected Sertoli cell genes was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Long-term treatment (7 days) of HSCs with higher concentrations of chemerin, irisin, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), resistin and progranulin significantly suppressed FSH receptor expression (by 79%, 83%, 64%, 71% and 26% respectively; P<0.005 for all) and significantly upregulated cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1) expression (by 48%, 90%, 126%, 126% and 153% respectively P<0.005 for all), comparable to what is found in the prepubertal state. Further, these adipocytokines significantly attenuated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-4, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, leukaemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 by HSCs. We propose that adipocytokines, at high concentrations, which are often observed in obese males when tested invitro, may negatively affect Sertoli cell maturation and retain these cells in a more prepubertal stage. This could negatively affect testis function and add to fertility problems in obese adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed to detect MLL gene rearrangements. Combined mutations of 17 genes were detected by DNA-based PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Sixty seven patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. The most commonly mutated gene was NPM1 (n=18), which was followed by FLT3-ITD (n=16), NRAS (n=16), DNMT3A (n=15), TET2 (n=12), RUNX1 (n=11) and KRAS (n=9). Based on the functions of mutated genes, the most frequently involved genes were those involved in DNA methylation (38.27%), tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (32.1%), transcription regulation (28.4%), and RAS pathway (24.7%). Single gene mutation predominated in patient with cytogenetic abnormalities, while coexistence of 2 mutations have predominated in patient with normal cytogenetic findings. Stratified by cytogenetic findings, patients with single gene mutations (intermediate-risk group) had significantly higher complete remission (CR) rates than those with >/=2 gene mutations (unfavorable-risk group) (91.7% vs. 57.6% , 87.5% vs. 25.0%, P =0.0319, 0.0117, respectively). CONCLUSION: Over 80% of AML patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. Their clinical phenotype and prognosis may be impacted by the synergy of MLL gene rearrangement and multiple mutations. For patients under the same risk stratification, the number of mutations is reversely correlated with the CR rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The karyotypes of 515 AML patients were analyzed by using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and R-banding technique. Combined with FAB typing and genetic testing, cytogenetic changes and prognosis of different age groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The abnormal cloning rate was 54.6% among the 515 patients. The abnormal cloning rate and adverse risk karyotype proportion of those with myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS) and secondary AML were higher than those with de novo AML (P = 0.027; P<0.01). A significant difference was found in the number of structural abnormalities and proportion of favorable risk karyotypes among different age groups (P = 0.026; P = 0.004). And there was also a significant difference in the abnormal cloning rate between different FAB types (P<0.01). In those with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the expression level of WT1 gene seemed to affect the prognosis. The survival rate of patients with karyotypes of adverse risk was lower than those with karyotypes of favorable risk (P = 0.015). The survival rate of the >/=60-year-old group was lower than the </=30-year-old and 31 to 59-year-old groups (P<0.01, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The karyotypes of AML patients have different age distribution characteristics. The survival rate of >/=60-years-old group and karyotype of poor prognosis is low. Patients with MDS with secondary AML have a poor prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, identifying the optimal treatment for these patients is a priority. Older patients with CLL are usually classified as fit, non-fit, or frail based on performance status and comorbidities, and several assessment tools can be used to make these evaluations. While supportive care is appropriate for frail patients, the remaining patients should be treated when indication criteria are met. Treatment options include chemoimmunotherapy, monoclonal antibody-based approaches (such as the use of rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) and, more recently, small molecules (such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax).

Epub 2019 May 4.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (25-OHD) has a role in bone health after treatment for cancer. 25-OHD deficiency has been associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but no data focusing on this topic in childhood cancer survivors have been published. We investigated the 25-OHD status in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and evaluated its influence on vascular function. METHODS: 25-OHD levels were evaluated in 52 ALL survivors and 40 matched healthy controls. Patients were grouped according to 25-OHD level (< 20 ng/m or >/= 20 ng/ml). Auxological parameters, biochemical and hemostatic markers of endothelial function (AD, HMW-AD, ET-1, vWFAg, TAT, D-dimers, Fbg, and hs-CRP), ultrasound markers of vascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation, FMD, common carotid intima-media thickness, C-IMT, and antero-posterior diameter of infra-renal abdominal aorta, APAO) were evaluated in the patients. RESULTS: Cases showed higher prevalence of 25-OHD deficiency than controls (p = 0.002). In univariate analysis via mean comparisons, 25-OHD deficient (< 20 ng/ml) patients showed higher C-IMT values compared to the 25-OHD non-deficient (>/= 20 ng/ml) group (P = 0.023). Significant differences were also found for ET-1 (P = 0.035) and AD-HMW (P = 0.015). In the multiple regression models controlling for some confounders, 25-OHD still was associated with C-IMT (P = 0.0163), ET-1 (P = 0.0077), and AD-HMW (P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood ALL survivors show higher prevalence of 25-OHD deficiency as compared to controls. The 25-OHD levels appear to be linked to indicators of endothelial and vascular dysfunction. Careful monitoring of 25-OHD balance may help to prevent cardiovascular diseases in childhood ALL survivors, characterized by high cardiovascular risk.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'C-IMT', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Vascular ultrasound studies', 'Vitamin D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8813-3200'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 4.,"PURPOSE: Survivorship in children with cancer comes at a cost of developing chronic treatment-related complications. Yet, it is still an under-researched area in Asia, which shares the largest proportion of the global childhood cancer burden given its vast population. This systematic review summarizes existing literature on clinically ascertained health outcomes in Asian survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A search was conducted on Ovid Medline and EMBASE for studies that focused on survivors of childhood cancer from countries in East and Southeast Asia; adopted post-treatment clinical ascertainment of organ-specific toxicities or/and secondary malignancy. Studies were excluded if health outcomes were assessed during the acute treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies, enrolling a total of 13,442 subjects, were conducted on survivors of leukemia (34%), CNS tumor (14%), and cohorts of survivors with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses (52%). The studies used different medical evaluation methods to assess cardiovascular (15%), metabolic and infertility (32%), and neurological/neurocognitive (20%) outcomes in survivors. The collective findings suggest potential differences in the prevalence of certain late effects (e.g., secondary malignancy and obesity) among Asian and non-Asian populations, which may reflect differences in treatment regimens, practice, genetic variations, or/and socioeconomic disparity. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend developing collaborative initiatives to build a regional repository of systematically assessed health outcomes and biospecimens to investigate treatment, social-environmental and genetic predictors, and interventions for late effects in this population. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The existing types of chronic health problems identified in this review suggest the need for active screening, better access to survivorship care, and promotion of protective health behavior in Asia.",,PMC6548762,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asian', '*Childhood cancer', '*Late effects', '*Organ toxicity', '*Risk-based', '*Survivorship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes expression in AML patients and determine their diagnostic and prognostic significance. We determined the expression of SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes and serum E-cadherin levels in early diagnosed patients with AML. Sixty early diagnosed AML patients and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study, SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes expression was determined by Real-time PCR while E-Cadherin serum levels were determined by ELISA. The results of this study demonstrated that, all AML patients positively expressed the SNAI1 gene with fold change 2.6. While, the ZEB1 expression was positive in 56.7% of the patients with fold change 1.8. SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes were highly expressed in M5 subtype (FC = 13.8 and 9.3, respectively). On the other hand, serum E-cadherin concentrations of the AML patients showed decrease when compared with those of the control but the decrease was not reach to the significance level. The findings of this study suggest inclusion of SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes expression in the cluster of potential genetic biomarkers to be studied in AML cases as diagnostic and prognostic markers.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Diagnostic and prognostic significance', 'E-cadherin', 'SNAI1', 'ZEB1']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6342-8608', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1304-1373']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 4.,"The CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has been widely proved effective on relapsed and refractory (r/r) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Meanwhile, CAR-T therapy-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities, are drawing researchers' attention. In addition, our research team notices that coagulopathy and even disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are common problems during CAR-T therapy. In our phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT02965092), 53 r/r B-ALL patients underwent leukapheresis on day - 11 and received lymphodepleting chemotherapy on day - 7 to day - 5. Finally, they received split infusions of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells on day 0 to day 2. Plasma concentrations of tissue factor (TF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecular-1 (PECAM-1) were also measured to identify the mechanism of coagulation disorders. The overall 1-month remission rate of the 53 patients was 88.7%. During the treatment course, 19 patients experienced grade 3-4 CRS, 8 patients developed grade 2-3 neurological toxicities. Beyond that, 30 patients (30/53, 56.6%) suffered from coagulation disorders, and half of them should be diagnosed as DIC. Benefiting from replacement and anticoagulant therapy, 14 patients successfully got out of the conditions of DIC. Remarkably, the severity of coagulopathy was positively correlated with CRS grade. What is more, plasma TF and PECAM-1 levels indicated that vascular endothelial factors played key roles in the process of CRS-related coagulopathy. To conclude, coagulation disorders frequently happen during CAR-T therapy. TF and PECAM-1 are of great importance in the etiology and pathogenesis of coagulation problems. Early and proper interventions targeted at CRS-related coagulopathy contribute a lot to the control of side effects in CAR-T therapy.","['2018ACA141/Major Technological Innovation Special Project of Hubei Province of', 'China', '81770132/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81873434/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chimeric antigen receptor-T therapy', '*Coagulation', '*Cytokine release syndrome', '*Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecular-1', '*Tissue factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 3.,"DNA methylation plays significant roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes including mammalian development, genomic imprinting, retrotransposon silencing, and X-chromosome inactivation. Recent discoveries indicated that ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases can convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). The TET family includes three members: TET1, TET2, and TET3. With increasing evidence, more and more biological and pathological processes in which 5-hmC and TET family serve unparalleled biological roles are noticed, for example, DNA demethylation and transcriptional regulation of different target genes, which are involved in many human diseases, especially hematologic malignancies, resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and so on. In this review, we focus on the diverse functions of TET family and the novel epigenetic marks, 5-mC and 5-hmC, in hematologic malignancies. This review will provide valuable insights into the potential targets of hematologic malignancies. Further understanding of the normal and pathological functions of TET family may provide new methods to develop novel epigenetic therapies for treating hematologic malignancies.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-Hydroxymethylcytosine', '5-Methylcytosine', 'DNA methylation', 'Hematologic malignancies']",,"['(c) 2019 S.

The new KIs have also changed frequency and epidemiology of infections, that represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality of the disease. Hence, the great strides in the indications and use of new KIs need parallel amelioration of prophylaxis and supportive treatment for infections. Moving from the recognition that infection control represents an unmet need, the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE) convened a panel of experts who had published and/or expressed an interest in infection complications in CLL. The goal of the project was to provide practice recommendations for the management of the infectious complications of CLL during ibrutinib or idelalisib therapy. The present publication represents the results of a series of email correspondences and meetings held during 2017 and 2018. Three domains of infectious complications during KIs therapy for CLL were explored: risk assessment, risk management and risk monitoring. We hope these recommendations will help to minimize infectious adverse events, and we believe that an optimal management of them will be rewarded by better outcomes, and better quality of life.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Idelalisib', '*Infection', '*Recommendations, ibrutinib']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2019 Apr 27.,"Describing the prognosis of sub-groups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated in real world with current therapies is becoming increasingly relevant to estimate the benefit that new targeted drugs will bring in the field. This is particularly the case when novel drugs are registered on the basis of non-randomized studies. IDH2 inhibitors have recently emerged as promising drugs in patients with IDH2(R140) or IDH2(R172) mutations. Enasidenib, a first-in-class IDH2 inhibitor, has been approved following promising results of a phase 1-2 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory AML patients with IDH2 mutations. In this study, we described the characteristics, treatments and outcome of 75 IDH2 mutated patients both at diagnosis and relapse or refractory disease. Among the 33 relapsed/refractory AML patients with either IDH2(R140) or IDH2(R172), 28 (84.8%) patients received salvage therapy and 14 achieved a complete response (50%). Median duration of response was 15.2 months. Median, 1-y, 3-y and 5-y OS were 15.1 months (IQR, 4.6-37.7), 53.1% (95% CI, 33.2-69.5), 29.2% (95% CI, 12.6-48.1) and 24.4% (95% CI, 9.3-43.1), respectively. In responding patients, median OS was 37.7 months and 1-y, 3-y and 5-y OS was 85.7%, 57.1% and 47.6%, respectively. In non-responding patients, median OS was 5.0 months (IQR, 4.5-8.6) and 1-y and 3-y OS was 17.9% and 0%, respectively. Thus, a substantial number of R/R AML patients with IDH2 mutations can be salvaged by current treatments and benefit from prolonged survival. It is expected that novel targeted agents such as enasidenib will further improve efficacy and safety in the next future.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Enasidenib', '*IDH', '*Refractory', '*Relapse']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that cytotoxic medicinal plants with novel phytochemicals can overcome MDR and kill MDR-cells with similar efficacy as drug sensitive cells. PURPOSE: We evaluated plant extracts from an unexplored ecosystem in Egypt with unusual climate and nutrient conditions for their activity against sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS/STUDY DESIGN: Methylene chloride: methanol (1:1) and methanol: H2O (7:3) extracts of 40 plants were prepared resulting in a sum of 76 fraction containing compounds with varying polarity. The resazurin reduction assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these extracts on five matched pairs of drug-sensitive and their drug-resistant cell lines. Flow cytometry and Western blotting was used to determine cell cycle analyses, apoptosis, and autophagy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Extracts derived from Withania obtusifolia (WO), Jasonia candicans (JC), Centaurea lippii (CL), and Pulicaria undulata (PU) were the most active ones among 76 extracts from 40 Egyptian medicinal plants. They showed a significant reduction of cell viability on drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line with IC50 values less than 7microg/ml. Low cross-resistance degrees were observed in multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells towards CL (1.82-fold) and JC (6.09-fold). All other drug-resistant cell lines did not reveal cross-resistance to the four extracts. Further mechanistic assessment have been studied for these four extracts. CONCLUSION: The methylene chloride: methanol (1:1) fractions of WO, JC, CL, and PU are promising cytotoxic extracts that could be used to combat MDR cancer cells through different cell death pathways.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxicity', 'Egypt', 'Mode of action', 'Multidrug resistance', 'Wild medicinal plants']",,['Copyright (c) 2018.

The ability of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to survive chemotherapy is primarily responsible for relapse, and eliminating LSCs is ultimately essential for cure. We developed novel disulfide-crosslinked CLL1-targeting micelles (DC-CTM), which can deliver high concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) into both bulk leukemia cells and LSCs. Compared to free DNR, DC-CTM-DNR had a longer half-life, increased DNR area under the curve concentration by 11-fold, and exhibited a superior toxicity profile. In patient-derived AML xenograft models, DC-CTM-DNR treatment led to significant decreases in AML engraftment and impairment of secondary transplantation compared to control groups. Collectively, we demonstrate superior anti-LSC/AML efficacy, and preferable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of DC-CTM-DNR compared to free DNR. DC-CTM-DNR has the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce therapy-related morbidity and mortality for patients with AML.","['U54 CA233306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA232845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD086195/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA138464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201400042C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA199668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8237247,['NIHMS1530710'],['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CLL1', '*Daunorubicin', '*Leukemia stem cells', '*Nanoparticle']",,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in our country, both approaches are costly and time-consuming options. METHODS: Over the last few years, haploidentical modalities have been investigated as an alternative donor source, showing similar results to those obtained with identical HLA donors. We started using T-cell-replete haploidentical with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in 2012 and we presented our experience with patients undergoing haploidentical ransplantation compared to SIB. RESULTS: Since January 2012 to date, 91 allogeneic transplants have been performed, of which 49 were haploidentical and 42 were HLA identical. The mean age of the patients was 35 years (range: 17-62). The mean CD34/kgx10(6) infused per group was 5.93 and 5.89, respectively. Time to granulocyte and platelet engraftment was 11 and 15 days, respectively, for haploidentical, and 12 and 14 days, respectively, for HLA identical (p=0.10). The 100-day cumulative incidence of global acute GVHD was 34% for haploidentical and 29% for SIHLA identical (p=0.9). The 2-year overall global graft-versus-host disease was 43% for haploidentical and 41% for HLA identical (p=0.8). Overall survival, relapse, and transplant and relapse-related mortality were similar between both groups. CONCLUSION: Our experience showed that haploidentical has similar outcomes to those obtained with HLA idential and can be performed in our country safely.",,PMC7031104,,['NOTNLM'],"['Haploidentical transplantation', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Epub 2019 May 3.,"The clinical outcomes of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have improved over time. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that ASCT is associated with a lower relapse rate and acceptable nonrelapse mortality compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with AML. In addition, ASCT is also associated with comparable overall survival outcomes to those of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in some patients with AML. To date, age, cytogenetic and molecular risk stratification, and minimal residual disease (MRD) status have been shown to be closely related to clinical outcomes following ASCT. ASCT is recommended for patients with favorable-risk and intermediate-risk AML in first complete remission and patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia in second complete remission for whom a matched sibling donor is not available. MRD status pre-ASCT is the most important factor to consider when determining whether a patient is eligible for ASCT and can effectively predict clinical outcomes after ASCT. Advanced age is not an absolute contradiction for ASCT. In this review, we describe the literature and clinical trials evaluating the outcomes of ASCT in patients with AML and discuss the indications for ASCT therapy. Because the greatest concern in ASCT recipients is early relapse, important factors that should be monitored before ASCT and future perspectives in this area are also presented.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Clinical outcomes', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Stratification']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 3.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains as an incurable disease and, although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative approach, most patients ultimately relapse, and their treatment remains challenging. Because allo-HSCT can modify not only the biology of the disease, but also the immune system and the microenvironment, it can potentially enhance the response to rescue therapies. Information on the efficacy and safety of novel drugs in patients relapsing after allo-HSCT is lacking, however. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of rescue therapies in patients with MM who relapsed after allo-HSCT, as well as to compare their efficacy before and after allo-HSCT. This retrospective multicenter study included 126 consecutive patients with MM who underwent allo-HSCT between 2000 and 2013 at 8 Spanish centers. All patients engrafted. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 47%, and nonrelapse mortality within the first 100 days post-transplantation was 13%. After a median follow-up of 92 months, overall survival (OS) was 51% at 2 years and 43% at 5 years. The median progression-free survival after allo-HSCT was 7 months, whereas the median OS after relapse was 33 months. Patients relapsing in the first 6 months after transplantation had a dismal prognosis compared with those who relapsed later (median OS, 11 months versus 120 months; P < .001). The absence of chronic GVHD was associated with reduced OS after relapse (hazard ratio, 3.44; P < .001). Most patients responded to rescue therapies, including proteasome inhibitors (PIs; 62%) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs; 77%), with a good toxicity profile. An in-depth evaluation, including the type and intensity of PI- and IMiD-based combinations used before and after allo-HSCT, showed that the overall response rate and duration of response after allo-HSCT were similar to those seen in the pretransplantation period. Patients with MM who relapse after allo-HSCT should be considered candidates for therapy with new drugs, which can achieve similar response rates with similar durability as seen in the pretransplantation period. This pattern does not follow the usual course of the disease outside the transplantation setting, where response rates and time to progression decreases with each consecutive line of treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allo-HSCT', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Immunomodulatory drug', '*Multiple myeloma', '*Proteasome inhibitor']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Transplantation outcomes of AML-MRC (n=4091) were compared with those of AML-NOS (n=3964) in patients who underwent allo-SCT between 2003 and 2016 using a nationwide registration database. The 3-year overall survival (OS; 35.5% versus 50.6%) was lower and the relapse (42.3% versus 32.1%) and nonrelapse mortality (26.3% versus 22.0%) rates were higher in the AML-MRC group than in the AML-NOS group. Based on the hierarchical AML-MRC classification, myelodysplasia as the sole criterion was associated with better OS compared with AML-NOS, whereas monosomal or complex karyotype and -5/del(5q) were associated with poor OS. A history of myelodysplastic syndrome and -7/del(7q) did not affect OS. Accordingly, AML-MRC with complex karyotype or -5/del(5q) and that with monosomal karyotype were classified as intermediate and high risks, respectively, whereas the remaining cases were classified as low risk. The 3-year OS rates were 50.7%, 36.9%, and 13.8% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (P < .001). Risk classification, older age, and low performance status score were significant risk factors for survival in AML-MRC, independently of the disease status. Grades I to II acute graft-versus-host disease significantly reduced the 3-year relapse (24.7% versus 31.6%), leading to better survival (hazard ratio, .64). Our prognostic risk stratification can potentially aid in elucidating the diverse transplantation outcomes in patients with AML-MRC.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Clinical results in acute leukemia', '*Marrow/stem cell transplantation', '*Stem cell transplantation']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is usually CD23 negative, a feature helpful in distinguishing MCL from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, a subset of MCL cases can be CD23+. Limited data are available regarding the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with CD23+ MCL. In this study, we reviewed 798 cases of MCL and identified 103 (13%) that were CD23+ by flow cytometry, all of which were positive for cyclin D1 and/or associated with CCND1/IGH. In all cases of CD23+ MCL, CD23 expression was dim partial or dim, unlike moderate to bright CD23 expression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. The clinicopathological features and outcome of patients with CD23+ MCL were compared with 240 patients with typical MCL negative for CD23. Patients with CD23+ MCL more often had an elevated leukocyte count (33% versus 18%, P=.009), bone marrow involvement (89% versus 78%, P=.02), stage 4 disease (87% versus 77%, P=.03), and a leukemic presentation (42% versus 11%, P=.0001). CD23+ MCL was also more often positive for CD200 (17% versus. 4.6%, P=.0005) and less commonly positive for SOX11 (55% versus. 74%, P=.027). All other clinicopathological features were similar. With similar treatment regimens and observation times, patients with CD23+ MCL had a significant better overall survival (P=.02) and progression-free survival (P=.029). In conclusion, CD23 expression was observed in 13% of MCL cases and is associated with a better prognosis in patients with MCL. CD23 is associated with leukocytosis, a leukemic presentation, bone marrow involvement, CD200 expression, and a lower frequency of SOX11 positivity.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD200', '*CD23', '*Leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma', '*Mantle cell lymphoma', '*Prognosis', '*SOX11']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Cytarabine remains the backbone of therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ability to assess intracellular cytarabine triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels in patients receiving cytarabine represents a major goal in the prediction of treatment response. This study, conducted within a clinical setting, aimed to assess ara-CTP levels in circulating peripheral blasts from non-M3 AML patients receiving cytarabine at one of three dosing levels, using a novel biosensor assay. Results from the initial 72 hours post-commencement were correlated with day 28 remission status, with feasibility parameters concurrently assessed. Intracellular ara-CTP was detectable in ex vivo blasts post-treatment for standard-dose (SD) and high-dose (HD) patients (p < 0.05), and quantification revealed a 27-fold increase in intracellular steady-state concentration between the two dosing levels. For low-dose cytarabine, high rates of patient discharge and low intracellular concentrations limited analysis; however, assessment of intracellular ara-CTP concentration was achievable in a dwindling population of blasts for SD and HD treatment cohorts, with 4 hours post-treatment commencement potentially being most predictive of clinical response (r=-0.912, p=0.0113). Concurrent assessment of peripheral leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP)-positive cells revealed a decline in burden (0-72 hours), which correlated with remission status (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly high rates of night sampling led to challenges associated with sampling rates, but did not have an impact on patient compliance. Additional training of night staff improved feasibility substantially. Multiple peripheral sampling during the initial 72 hours of treatment is feasible in newly diagnosed patients, and ara-CTP is detectable over the initial 24 hours, facilitating prediction of chemosensitivity of leukemic blasts to cytarabine.",['MR/J005207/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2019 May 1.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid disorders characterized by peripheral cytopenias and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Inflammatory, auto-immune or syndromic symptoms can make the diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis is currently based on bone marrow cytology but cytogenetics and molecular features are currently overpassing their initial prognostic function (allowing early diagnosis and prediction of therapeutic response). The prognostic classification is based on the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System, which also provides guidance for therapeutic management. The treatment of low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes is based on the correction of cytopenias (erythropoiesis stimulating agents, transfusions, lenalidomide, etc.), whereas in high-risk group, the goal is the control of the leukemic clone (hypomethylating agents, allograft of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). Other molecules are used to manage complications of cytopenias or transfusion (anti-infectious prophylaxis and treatments, martial chelation). New molecules are being studied with some interesting results (luspatercept, venetoclax). This article aims to provide an update on the knowledge that an internist should know for the practical management of myelodysplastic syndromes in 2019.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Auto-immunity', 'Auto-immunite', 'Chelation', 'Chelation', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Review', 'Revue', 'Syndromes myelodysplasiques', 'Traitement', 'Treatment']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: From January 2015 to December 2016, >/=18-year-old patients with primary high perianal abscess who were treated at our department were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria: (1) recurrent perianal abscess; (2) complicated with anal fistula formation; (3) preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative physical therapy, and curettage treatment, negative pressure irrigation; (4) Crohn's disease-related perianal abscess; (5) with immunosuppressive status, such as transplant recipients; (6) co-existence of malignant tumors, such as leukemia; (7) with diabetes; (8) those who could not receive long-term follow-up and were not suitable to participate in this study. According to the random number table method, the patients were randomly divided into negative pressure irrigation and suction group and routine drainage group. All patients were clearly diagnosed and the location and size of the perianal abscess were marked before surgery. These two groups were treated as follows: (1) Negative pressure irrigation and suction group: the skin was incised at a diameter of 1-2 cm at the site where the abscess fluctuated most obviously. After the abscess was removed, a closed negative pressure irrigation and suction device was installed and the pressure of -200 to -100 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) was maintained to keep the abscess cavity collapsed. Generally, the irrigation was stopped 5 days later or when the drainage was clear. The closed vacuum suction was maintained for 2 additional days, before the wound was sutured. (2) Conventional drainage group: conventional incision and drainage was carried out. The skin was cut at a diameter of 8 to 10 cm at the site of abscess with most obvious fluctuation. After the abscess was removed, normal saline gauze was used for dressing. Dressing was changed regularly until the wound healed. The efficacy, operative time, intraoperative bleeding, incision length, frequency of dressing change, pain index (visual analogue score, VAS score), postoperative healing time, complications, recurrence rate of perianal abscess, anal fistula formation rate were observed. The t test and chi(2) test were used for comparison between the 2 groups. Results: There were both 40 patients in the negative pressure irrigation and suction group and the conventional drainage group. There were 28 males and 12 females in negative pressure irrigation and suction group with a mean age of (38.3+/-12.0) years and mean disease course of (6.6+/-2.1) days. The abscess in pelvic-rectal space accounted for 50.0% (20/40) and the mean diameter of abscess was (8.0+/-3.7) cm. There were 26 males and 14 females in the conventional drainage group with a mean age of (37.1+/-11.8) years and mean disease course of (6.4+/-2.5) days. The abscess in pelvic-rectal space accounted for 55.0% (22/40) and the diameter of abscess was (8.2+/-3.5) cm. The differences in baseline data between two groups were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). Both groups successfully completed the operation. There was no significant difference in operative time between two groups (P>0.05). As compared to conventional drainage group, intraoperative blood loss in negative pressure irrigation and suction group was less [(12.1+/-5.5) ml vs. (18.3+/-4.4) ml, t=5.606, P<0.001], incision length was shorter [(2.3+/-0.8) cm vs. (7.6+/-1.7) cm, t=17.741, P<0.001], postoperative VAS pain scores at 1-, 3-, 7-, and 14-day after operation were lower [3.7+/-1.4 vs. 7.6+/-1.8, t=10.816, P<0.001; 3.0+/-1.3 vs. 6.8+/-1.6, t=11.657, P<0.001; 2.7+/-0.9 vs. 5.1+/-1.1, t=10.679, P<0.001; 1.2+/-0.3 vs. 1.6+/-0.4, t=5.060, P=0.019], the dressing change within 7 days after operation was less (3.5+/-1.2 vs. 12.6+/-2.7, t=19.478, P<0.001), postoperative healing time was shorter [(10.4+/-3.0) d vs. (13.5+/-3.8) d, t=4.049, P<0.001] and postoperative complication rate was lower [17.5% (7/40) vs. 2.5% (1/40), chi(2)=5.000, P=0.025]. During follow-up of 12 to 36 (24+/-5) months, the recurrence rate of perianal abscess within 1 year after operation and anal fistula formation rate in negative pressure irrigation and suction group were lower than those in conventional drainage group [5.0% (2/40) vs. 20.0% (8/40), chi(2)=4.114, P=0.042 and 2.5% (1/40) vs. 17.5% (7/40), chi(2)=5.000, P=0.025, respectirely]. The one-time cure rate of negative pressure irrigation and suction group and conventional drainage group was 92.5% (37/40) and 62.5%(25/40), respectirely (chi(2)=10.323, P=0.001).

Epub 2019 May 1.,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) has been characterized as one of the most crucial negative regulator in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. However, there are few studies on the relationship between SOCS3 and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study analyzes the influence of SOCS3 expression on the risk and the progression of pediatric ALL and the underlying mechanism. The levels of SOCS3, p-JAK2, p-STAT3, SOCS3 methylation, CD4+CD25+CD127lowTreg were detected by PCR, laser confocal microscopy, western blot, bisulfite sequencing and flow cytometry at different progression of ALL. We found that the SOCS3 expression level at initial diagnosis (DG) of ALL patients was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (HC), while the expression of SOCS3 methylation was opposite. The expression of SOCS3 and SOCS3 methylation were returned to normal in the complete remission (CR) stage, and there were no difference between resistance, relapse and initial diagnosis. The expression of SOCS3 decreased and weakened the inhibition of pSTAT3 expression in DG, resistance and relapse groups. The levels of Treg cells in ALL children were significantly higher than those in the HC children. There was a positive correlation between the expression level of STAT3 and the expression level of Treg cells in children with ALL, while that was negatively correlated with the expression levels of Treg cells. Compared with high-level of SOCS3, the low-level of SOCS3 patients had more high risk factors, as higher WBC counts, LDH level and much more poor prognostic genes. SOCS3 methylation leads to low-expression of SOCS3, which can lead to continuous activation of JAK/STAT3 and increased expression of Treg cells, which in turn affects the anti-tumor immunological effect of the body. Taken together, our data show that monitoring the level of SOCS3 can contribute to the understanding of the state of illness and evaluate the risk of progression of ALL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Methylation', 'Pediatric', 'SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3', 'Treg']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2019 Apr 25.,"The impact of genetic aberrations on rituximab-based therapeutic regimens has been intensely studied in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). According to the current consensus chemoimmunotherapy consisting of rituximab and DNA-damaging drugs is not suitable for patients with TP53 defects. In our study, we focused on CLL patients with an intact TP53 gene and investigated four recurrently mutated genes in CLL, genomic aberrations by FISH, and IGHV status with the aim of analyzing their impact on progression-free survival (PFS) after front-line therapy with FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) or BR (bendamustine, rituximab) regimens. Using next-generation sequencing, we analyzed 120 patients treated with FCR and 57 patients treated with BR at a university hospital. We used a 10% cut-off for variant allele frequency and recorded the following mutation frequencies in the pre-therapy samples: ATM 23%, SF3B1 20%, NOTCH1 19% and BIRC3 11%. The data on cytogenetic aberrations (11q22, 13q14, trisomy 12) and IGHV mutation status were also considered in PFS analyses. In univariate analyses, we observed a negative impact of BIRC3 mutations and 11q22 deletion in both regimens, while the unmutated IGHV status was associated with a significantly shorter PFS only in the FCR-treated cohort. In a multivariate analysis, only deletion 11q22 in both regimens, and the unmutated IGHV in the FCR cohort maintained an independent association with the reduced PFS. Notably, sole 11q22 deletion, without an ATM mutation on the other allele, manifested the shortest PFS of all analyzed markers. Deletion 11q22 and IGHV status predict PFS in previously untreated CLL patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATM', '*BIRC3', '*Chemoimmunotherapy', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/CLL', '*Deletion 11q22', '*IGHV']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 May 1.,"The HOXA gene cluster is generally recognized as a pivotal mediator of positional identity in the skeletal system, expression of different orthologues conferring alternative locational phenotype of the vertebrate bone. Strikingly, however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate orthologue-specific expression of different HOXA cluster members in gestating osteoblasts remain largely obscure, but in analogy to the processes observed in acute lymphatic leukemia it is assumed that alternative methylation of HOXA promoter regions drives position specific expression patterns. In an effort to understand HOXA cluster gene expression in osteogenesis we characterize both expression and the epigenetic landscape of the HOXA gene cluster during in vitro osteoblast formation from mesenchymal precursors. We observe that osteoblast formation per se provokes strong upregulation of HOXA gene cluster expression, in particular of midcluster genes, and paradoxal downregulation of HOXA7 and HOXA10. These differences in expression appear related to promoter methylation. LnRNAs HOTAIR and HOTTIP, known to modulate HOXA expression, are also regulated by their promoter methylation processing, but do not correlate with HOXA cluster expression profile. We thus conclude that HOXA expression is profoundly regulated during osteoblast differentiation through canonical methylation-dependent mechanisms but not through the flanking lnRNAs.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone', '*Development', '*Differentiation', '*Hox genes', '*HoxA genes', '*Osteoblast']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Jun 5.,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic advances have improved survival after hematological cancers. In turn, patients may be at increased risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events. OBJECTIVES: To examine the risks of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and bleeding requiring hospital contact in patients with hematological cancers. METHODS: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study (2000-2013). We identified all adult hematological cancer patients and sampled a general population comparison cohort in a 1:5 ratio matched by age, sex, previous thromboembolic events, bleeding, and solid cancer. Ten-year absolute risks of thromboembolism and bleeding were calculated and hazard ratios (HRs) were computed, controlling for matching factors. RESULTS: Among 32 141 hematological cancer patients, the 10-year absolute risk of any thromboembolic or bleeding complication following hematological cancer was 19%: 3.3% for MI, 3.5% for ischemic stroke, 5.2% for VTE, and 8.5% for bleeding. Except among patients with myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, the risk of thromboembolic events surpassed that of bleeding. The hematological cancer cohort overall was at increased risk for MI [HR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.49], ischemic stroke (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.33), VTE (HR = 3.37, 95% CI: 3.13-3.64), and bleeding (HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 2.26-2.53) compared with the general population.

Epub 2019 May 3.,"OBJECTIVES: Epigenetic modifiers were important players in the development of haematological malignancies and sensitivity to therapy. Mutations of SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2), a methyltransferase that catalyses the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), were found in various myeloid malignancies. However, the detailed mechanisms through which SETD2 confers chronic myeloid leukaemia progression and resistance to therapy targeting on BCR-ABL remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The level of SETD2 in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells was examined by immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR. We analysed CD34(+) CD38(-) leukaemic stem cells by flow cytometry and colony formation assays upon SETD2 knockdown or overexpression. The impact of SETD2 expression alterations or small-molecule inhibitor JIB-04 targeting H3K36me3 loss on imatinib sensitivity was assessed by IC50, cell apoptosis and proliferation assays. Finally, RNA sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR were performed to verify putative downstream targets. RESULTS: SETD2 was found to act as a tumour suppressor in CML. The novel oncogenic targets MYCN and ERG were shown to be the direct downstream targets of SETD2, where their overexpression induced by SETD2 knockdown caused imatinib insensitivity and leukaemic stem cell enrichment in CML cell lines. Treatment with JIB-04, an inhibitor that restores H3K36me3 levels through blockade of its demethylation, successfully improved the cell imatinib sensitivity and enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our study not only emphasizes the regulatory mechanism of SETD2 in CML, but also provides promising therapeutic strategies for overcoming the imatinib resistance in patients with CML.","['16XJ11003/The Shanghai Youth Talent Support Program, School of Medicine, Shanghai', 'Jiao Tong University', 'Innovative research team of high-level local universities in Shanghai', '17QA1402100/Shanghai Rising-Star Program', '2017YFA0102900/National Key R&D Program of China', '81772743/NSFC', '20181706/Shanghai Municipal Education Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant', 'Support']",PMC6668982,,['NOTNLM'],"['SETD2', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'epigenetic regulator', 'imatinib resistance']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1989-4927', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0290-5527']",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 24.,"Parental occupational exposures to pesticides, animals and organic dust have been associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer based mostly on case-control studies. We prospectively evaluated parental occupational exposures and risk of childhood leukemia and central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium. We pooled data on 329,658 participants from birth cohorts in five countries (Australia, Denmark, Israel, Norway and United Kingdom). Parental occupational exposures during pregnancy were estimated by linking International Standard Classification of Occupations-1988 job codes to the ALOHA+ job exposure matrix. Risk of childhood (<15 years) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 129), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 31) and CNS tumors (n = 158) was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Paternal exposures to pesticides and animals were associated with increased risk of childhood AML (herbicides HR = 3.22, 95% CI = 0.97-10.68; insecticides HR = 2.86, 95% CI = 0.99-8.23; animals HR = 3.89, 95% CI = 1.18-12.90), but not ALL or CNS tumors. Paternal exposure to organic dust was positively associated with AML (HR = 2.38 95% CI = 1.12-5.07), inversely associated with ALL (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31-0.99) and not associated with CNS tumors. Low exposure prevalence precluded evaluation of maternal pesticide and animal exposures; we observed no significant associations with organic dust exposure. This first prospective analysis of pooled birth cohorts and parental occupational exposures provides evidence for paternal agricultural exposures as childhood AML risk factors. The different risks for childhood ALL associated with maternal and paternal organic dust exposures should be investigated further.","['G9815508/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '102215/2/13/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*agricultural exposures', '*animals', '*childhood brain tumors', '*childhood cancer', '*childhood leukemia', '*organic dust', '*parental occupation', '*pesticides']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0300-1917', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1294-1679', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8324-3873']",['(c) 2019 UICC.'],,,,,['International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 3.,"PURPOSE: High expression of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) has been associated with a poor prognosis in leukemia patients, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Aberrant expression of microRNAs plays critical roles in leukemia development. MiR-9 is a putative potential target of EVI1. We have investigated the regulating mechanism of miR-9 by EVI1 in leukemia cells. METHODS: We first examined the relationship between miR-9 and EVI1 expression levels in nine leukemia cell lines by RT-PCR. Then we forced high expression of EVI1 in UoCM1 and K562 cells to confirm the downregulation of miR-9 by EVI1. Methylation of the miR-9 promoter region was detected by DNA bisulfite sequencing. We treated the EVI1-overexpressing cells with the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) to reverse EVI1-induced hypermethylation of miR-9. RESULTS: EVI1 and miR-9 expression was negative related. Forced expression of EVI1 downregulated miR-9 by inducing hypermethylation of the miR-9 promoter. 5-AZA reversed high EVI1-induced hypermethylation of the miR-9 promoter and restored the expression of miR-9. 5-AZA induced extensive apoptosis and inhibited proliferation through cell cycle arrest in EVI1-overexpressing leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that EVI1 may be involved in leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis via the regulation of miR-9 promoter methylation. 5-AZA may represent a promising therapeutic option for EVI1-high leukemia patients.","['2013SY073/Advanced Suitable Technology Popularization Project of Shanghai Health', 'System']",,,['NOTNLM'],"[""5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", 'EVI1', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'miR-9']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6585-8452'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An EFSA-commissioned systematic review of pesticide epidemiological studies (Ntzani et al. in Literature review on epidemiological studies linking exposure to pesticides and health effects. EFSA supporting publication 2013:EN-497, 2013) revealed statistically significant associations, among others, between pesticide exposures, and Parkinson's disease and childhood leukemia. Thereafter, EFSA launched a project with a mandate for the plant protection products and their residues (PPR) Panel to set the ground for the use of epidemiological data in the risk assessment of pesticides, as requested by Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. The project culminated with the publication of two EFSA's scientific opinions on the potential contribution of experimental investigations and epidemiological studies in PPP risk assessment and with the scientific conference held on 20 November 2017, in Parma, Italy. The application of modern methodologies in exposure assessment, toxicology and epidemiology would improve the pesticide risk assessment process and support a mechanistic shift for the integration of these three disciplines under a novel paradigm in risk assessment. The application of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to this approach would contribute to gain insight into the biological plausibility of a hazard identified in epidemiological or experimental studies and would inform an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA) within a regulatory context.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adverse outcome pathway (AOP)', '*Epidemiology', '*Exposure', '*Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA)', '*Pesticides', '*Plant protection products', '*Risk assessment']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-3864'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show, through meta-analyses of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, that dasatinib is associated with high risk for glomerular toxicity that is uncoupled from hypertension, suggesting a direct link between dasatinib and podocytes. We further investigate the cellular effects of dasatinib and other comparable KIs with varying risks of nephrotoxicity. Dasatinib treated podocytes show significant changes in focal adhesions, actin cytoskeleton, and morphology that are not observed with other KIs. We use phosphoproteomics and kinome profiling to identify the molecular mechanisms of dasatinib-induced injury to the actin cytoskeleton, and atomic force microscopy to quantify impairment to cellular biomechanics. Furthermore, chronic administration of dasatinib in mice causes reversible glomerular dysfunction, loss of stress fibers, and foot process effacement. We conclude that dasatinib induces nephrotoxicity through altered podocyte actin cytoskeleton, leading to injurious cellular biomechanics.","['R01 DK118222/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK103022/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072853/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM116415/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 NS046593/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG008098/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD025047/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6499885,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1664-7314', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3608-5638', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6137-109X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models. To account for multiple testing, P < .01 for the donor/graft variable was considered statistically significant. Clinical characteristics were similar between UCB and 7/8 BM recipients, because most had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (62%), 64% received total body irradiation-based conditioning, and 60% received anti-thymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. Methotrexate-based GVHD prophylaxis was more common with 7/8 BM (79%) than with UCB (15%), in which mycophenolate mofetil was commonly used. The univariate estimates of GRFS and CRFS were 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16-29) and 27% (95% CI, 20-34), respectively, with 7/8 BM and 33% (95% CI, 31-36) and 38% (95% CI, 35-40), respectively, with UCB (P < .001).

However, the 7/8 BM group had a significantly higher risk for grade III-IV aGVHD (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16-2.48; P = .006) compared with the UCB group. UCB and 7/8 BM groups had similar outcomes, as measured by GRFS and CRFS.

Thus, the study of genetic alterations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying leukaemogenesis, to improve the prognosis and to increase the survival of these patients. However, there is no synthesis of evidence in the literature evaluating the quality of evidence and the risk of bias in the studies such that the results can be translated. Thus, this systematic review protocol aims to assess the impact of SNPs on genes involved in the metabolism of cytarabine and anthracyclines with respect to survival, treatment response and toxicity in patients with AML. METHODS: This systematic review protocol is based on PRISMA guidelines and includes searches in six electronic databases, contact with authors, repositories of clinical trials, and cancer research. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals will be included if they meet the eligibility criteria: (a) samples composed of individuals of any age, of both sexes, with a diagnosis of AML, regardless of the time of diagnosis of disease; (b) participants who have undergone or are undergoing cytarabine- and anthracycline-associated chemotherapy or cytarabine-only chemotherapy; and (c) in vivo studies. Studies that include patients with promyelocytic leukaemia (Fab type 3) will be excluded because this disease has different treatment. The process of study selection, data extraction, and evaluation/synthesis will be performed in duplicate. Assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias will be performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized clinical studies and the Downs-Black Checklist for cohort and case-control studies. The synthesis of evidence will include the level of evidence based on the GRADE protocol. A meta-analysis of the association between SNPs and outcomes may be performed based on Cochrane guidelines. DISCUSSION: It is expected that clinical decisions for AML patients will consider evidence-based practices to contribute to better patient management.

Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required to improve AML clinical outcomes. 4-Amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR), a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) derivative designed and synthesized by our team, has been proven to show biological anti-tumor characteristics in our previous studies. However, its potential effect on leukemia remains unknown. The present research aims to investigate the underlying mechanism of treating leukemia with ATPR in vitro. METHODS: In this study, the AML cell lines NB4 and THP-1 were treated with ATPR. Cell proliferation was analyzed by the CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle distribution and cell differentiation. The expression levels of cell cycle and differentiation-related proteins were detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The NBT reduction assay was used to detect cell differentiation. RESULTS: ATPR inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell differentiation and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, ATPR treatment induced a time-dependent release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway was downregulated 24 h after ATPR treatment, which might account for the anti-AML effects of ATPR that result from the ROS-mediated regulation of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations could help to develop new drugs targeting the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway for the treatment of AML.","['2011ZX09401/This work was supported by the National Major Scientific and', ""Technological Special Project for ''Significant New Drugs Development''""]",PMC6498685,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATPR', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Differentiation', 'PTEN/PI3K/AKT', 'Proliferation', 'ROS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this study we employed a two-stage approach to identify candidate sarcoma risk genes. First, we conducted whole exome sequencing in three multigenerational cancer families ascertained through a sarcoma proband (n = 19) in order to prioritize candidate genes for validation in an independent case-control cohort of sarcoma patients using family-based association and segregation analysis. The second stage employed a burden analysis of rare variants within prioritized candidate genes identified from stage one in 560 sarcoma cases and 1144 healthy ageing controls, for which whole genome sequence was available. RESULTS: Variants from eight genes were identified in stage one. Following gene-based burden testing and after correction for multiple testing, two of these genes, ABCB5 and C16orf96, were determined to show statistically significant association with cancer. The ABCB5 gene was found to have a higher burden of putative regulatory variants (OR = 4.9, p-value = 0.007, q-value = 0.04) based on allele counts in sarcoma cases compared to controls. C16orf96, was found to have a significantly lower burden (OR = 0.58, p-value = 0.0004, q-value = 0.003) of regulatory variants in controls compared to sarcoma cases. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these genetic association data we propose that ABCB5 and C16orf96 are novel candidate risk genes for sarcoma. Although neither of these two genes have been previously associated with sarcoma, ABCB5 has been shown to share clinical drug resistance associations with melanoma and leukaemia and C16orf96 shares regulatory elements with genes that are involved with TNF-alpha mediated apoptosis in a p53/TP53-dependent manner. Future genetic studies in other family and population cohorts will be required for further validation of these novel findings.",,PMC6499942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer cluster families', '*Genetic risk variants', '*Sarcoma', '*Whole exome sequencing', '*Whole genome sequencing']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7781-4465'],,,,,,['International Sarcoma Kindred Study'],,,,,,,,,,,

Synthetic modification of naringenin is of continuous interest. During this study our aim was to synthesize a compound library of oxime and oxime ether derivatives of naringenin, and to investigate their biological activities. Two oximes and five oxime ether derivatives were prepared; their structure has been elucidated by NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. The antiproliferative activity of the prepared compounds was evaluated by MTT assay against human leukemia (HL-60) and gynecological cancer cell lines isolated from cervical (HeLa, Siha) and breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) cancers. Tert-butyl oxime ether derivative exerted the most potent cell growth inhibitory activity. Moreover, cell cycle analysis suggested that this derivative caused a significant increase in the hypodiploid (subG1) phase and induced apoptosis in Hela and Siha cells, and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in MCF-7 cells. The proapoptotic potential of the selected compound was confirmed by the activation of caspase-3. Antioxidant activities of the prepared molecules were also evaluated with xanthine oxidase, DPPH and ORAC assays, and the methyl substituted oxime ether exerted the most promising activity.","['K119770/Nemzeti Kutatasi Fejlesztesi es Innovacios Hivatal', '20391-3/2018/FEKUSTRAT/Emberi Eroforrasok Miniszteriuma']",PMC6539930,,['NOTNLM'],"['antioxidant', 'antiproliferative', 'caspase activity', 'cell cycle analysis', 'naringenin derivative', 'naringenin-oxime', 'oxime ether']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3243-5300'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although berberine has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of several tumor cell lines, its poor absorption and moderate activity hamper its full therapeutic potential. Here, we describe the synthesis of a series of 9-O-substituted berberine derivatives with improved antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities. An analysis of novel berberine derivatives by EPR spectroscopy confirmed their similar photosensitivity and analogous behavior upon UVA irradiation as berberine, supporting their potential to generate ROS. Improved antitumor activity of novel berberine derivatives was revealed by MTT assay, by flow cytometry and by detection of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, respectively. We showed that novel berberine derivatives are potent inhibitors of growth of HeLa and HL-60 tumor cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 16.7 microM for HL-60 cells and 36 to >200 microM for HeLa cells after 48 h treatment. Further cell cycle analysis showed that the observed inhibition of growth of HL-60 cells treated with berberine derivatives was due to arresting these cells in the G2/M and S phases. Most strikingly, we found that berberine derivative 3 (9-(3-bromopropoxy)-10-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquino[3,2-a] isoquinolin-7-ylium bromide) possesses 30-fold superior antiproliferative activity with an IC50 value of 0.7 microM and 6-fold higher apoptosis-inducing activity in HL-60 leukemia cells compared to berberine.

Epub 2013 Apr 26.,"Tobacco addiction is among the top preventable health risks to combat cancer. Smoking is responsible for almost 30% of cancer deaths in Canada; it increases the risk of developing cancers of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, cervix, pancreas, esophagus, colon, rectum, kidney, and bladder and in acute myeloid leukemia. Nonsmokers exposed to second-hand smoke are also at higher risk of developing lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. More than 300 nonsmokers die from lung cancer each year due to second-hand smoke. Smoking cessation programs can improve overall health and quality of life for cancer survivors. Most cancer patients would like to quit smoking, but they find it difficult. Advice and support from health care professionals can increase success. A cancer diagnosis may be the impetus required for patients to make that positive change in their lives. Studies have shown that continued smoking while receiving radiation therapy limits treatment efficacy. Additionally, smoking interferes with chemotherapy and can negatively affect wound healing. Smoking cessation is an evidence-based program; patients who quit smoking are less likely to experience recurrence of disease or additional primary cancers. Even brief interventions may be what the patient needs to assess the benefits of quitting. Many cancer health care professionals do not feel prepared to discuss smoking cessation with their patients. A large number of cancer patients survive more than 5 years past their diagnosis, making smoking cessation an even more important focus in long-term disease management and improving the length and quality of life for these patients. The aim of this directed reading is to assist radiation therapists to support their patients who smoke and integrate smoking cessation into clinical practice.",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2011 Jun 8.,"Since the discovery of x-rays, many investigations of radiation effects on humans have taken place. From the discovery of severe x-ray dermatitis near the end of 1896, the multiple radiation burns endured by Thomas Edison's assistant, Clarence Dally, to the establishment of early radiation regulation in 1929, radiation exposure has been a continuing concern. Studies from the 1940s to the 1960s looked at effects such as leukemia and other cancers that appeared to be caused by exposure to radiation; outcomes of these studies resulted in increased regulation, establishment of dose tolerances and the development of the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP). Since the 1960s, similar studies have continued resulting in stricter dose limits. However, a recent resurgence of radiation exposure injuries led to this literature review that revealed a gap in the literature concerning the radiation practices and continued education of today's radiologic technologists. Through this review, recommendations for dose reduction strategies are included.",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Feb 12.,"INTRODUCTION: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often performed in leukemia and lymphoma patients with pulmonary infiltrates, mainly to rule out infection. However, malignant hematopoietic infiltrates are uncommon and a comprehensive cytologic study has not yet been performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all BAL samples from our institution for the past 22 years (November 1992-October 2014). RESULTS: There were 37 cases of hematologic malignancies identified on BAL specimens (21 female patients and 16 male patients, age 22-80 years). Eighteen patients (49%) had pneumonia-like symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis of their malignancy, including fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress/hypoxia, and cough. The biopsy-proven cases were 25 leukemia (12 acute myeloid leukemia, 6 acute promyelocytic leukemia, 2 acute monocytic leukemia, 2 acute myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase, 1 large granular leukemia, and 1 plasma cell leukemia), 11 lymphoma (8 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymphoma, 1 natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and 1 T-cell lymphoma), and 1 multiple myeloma. Chest X-ray findings included opacities, consolidation, and interstitial edema. Four patients had BAL specimens with concomitant microorganisms. Eighteen patients subsequently died (2 days to 4 years), 15 were alive (3 weeks to 8 years of follow-up), and 4 were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: BAL is especially important in distinguishing inflammatory/infectious processes from neoplastic disorders because many patients with hematologic malignancies can have pneumonia-like symptoms as part of their initial disease presentation. Causative pathogens are identified in only a minority of malignant BAL specimens from these patients. Lung involvement in patients with hematologic malignancies carries a poor prognosis.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bronchoalveolar lavage', 'Cytology', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Plasma cell myeloma']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society of Cytopathology.

Epub 2014 Oct 23.,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma (MS) in cytology samples is challenging, especially when these tumors occur prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. The aim of this study was to review our cytopathology service's experience with a series of MS cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archival records were searched from which 16 cytology cases of MS were identified and reviewed. Clinical findings, cytomorphology, and ancillary studies were analyzed. RESULTS: MS was secondary to acute myeloid leukemia in 14 cases, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis in 1 case, and myelodysplastic syndrome in another. Flow cytometry was supportive in 11 cases, immunostains were helpful when performed in 4 cases, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization in the CML case showed t(9;22). Cellularity was variable in all leukemia subtypes. Blasts had round or cleaved nuclei with indistinct nucleoli. Maturing granulocytes were present only in the patient with CML, or with peripheral blood contamination (4 cases). Other blood precursors were absent. Apoptosis and lymphoglandular bodies were present in almost one-half of the cases, which correlated with increased blasts. Mitoses were infrequent (6 cases) and necrosis was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of MS in cytology specimens can be made in cases with adequate cellularity and supportive ancillary studies in the correct clinical context. MS was harder to diagnose in cytology cases with low cellularity, blood contamination, and few blasts. Cytologic features that pose diagnostic pitfalls are lymphoglandular bodies suggestive of lymphoma and maturing or mixed granulocytes that mimic infection.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Blast', 'Cytopathology', 'Fine-needle aspiration', 'Leukemia', 'Myeloid sarcoma']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society of Cytopathology.

Epub 2015 Feb 9.,"INTRODUCTION: The cytopathologic diagnosis of the rare vascular tumor epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) in patients who have no previous history of EHE or who have a complicated and/or misleading disease history is challenging. Furthermore, few studies have described the cytopathology of EHE. Herein, we identify 14 cases of EHE from 10 patients, some of whom had a history of epithelial tumor, and provide a detailed report of the cytomorphology of EHE, discuss the tumor's differential diagnoses, and describe ancillary examinations that may be helpful in diagnosing EHE cytologically, especially in patients with a complex disease history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved the slides of 14 cases of EHE archived between 2002 and 2009 in our institution's cytology section. Conventional direct smears and cell block sections were prepared from most fine-needle aspiration samples and from all effusion samples. Cell block sections were subjected to immunostaining for vascular, mesothelial, and epithelial markers. RESULTS: EHE shared many morphologic features with other, more common tumors such as adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma. The defining cytologic feature of EHE was an intracellular lumen containing entrapped intact and degenerating erythrocytes, which was not present in every case. EHE cells were positive for the vascular markers CD34, CD31, factor VIII, and friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI-1) and negative for epithelial and mesothelial markers. Clinicians provided information important to the diagnosis of EHE. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully examining the smear and cell block sections for morphologic features indicative of EHE (eg, prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization, intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, and intracellular lumen containing entrapped intact and degenerating erythrocytes), confirming these findings with immunocytochemical staining, and communicating with clinicians are all important to correctly diagnosing EHE.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical information', 'Cytology', 'Differential diagnosis', 'Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma', 'Immunocytochemistry', 'Vascular markers']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society of Cytopathology.

Epub 2014 Sep 6.,"INTRODUCTION: Bladder infiltration by leukemia or lymphoma is rare and can mimic benign processes such as follicular cystitis (FC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight benign and malignant hematologic diseases encountered in urine cytology were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, radiographic, and cytologic findings. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 2 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 4 cases of FC. The most common presenting symptom was hematuria. Imaging findings included echogenic debris within the bladder or an adjacent soft tissue mass in acute myeloid leukemia cases and bladder wall thickening in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases. No FC cases had any imaging abnormalities. Cytologic material of the leukemia cases showed numerous myeloid blasts with markedly increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, centrally located nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, nuclear indentations, and some irregular nuclear membranes. The background showed sparse urothelial cells and histiocytes. Both lymphoma cases showed a discohesive population of atypical large lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear borders and prominent nucleoli. The FC cases had a background lymphoid cell population with a maturation spectrum from small lymphocytes to large lymphoid cells (immunoblasts) and histiocytes including tingible body macrophages. Additionally, there were many mature squamous cells and reactive urothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder leukemia, lymphoma, and FC are infrequently encountered on urine cytology. FC can be distinguished from a hematologic malignancy by the presence of a lymphocytic maturation spectrum and tingible body macrophages. Radiologic abnormalities are associated with malignant processes; however, discrete bladder masses are usually not identified.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bladder', 'Cytology', 'Follicular cystitis', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society of Cytopathology.

Epub 2019 May 29.,"Molecular genetic changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) play crucial roles in leukemogenesis, including recurrent chromosome translocations, epigenetic/spliceosome mutations and transcription factor aberrations. Six1, a transcription factor of the Sine oculis homeobox (Six) family, has been shown to transform normal hematopoietic progenitors into leukemia in cooperation with Eya. However, the specific role and the underlying mechanism of Six1 in leukemia maintenance remain unexplored. Here, we showed increased expression of SIX1 in AML patients and murine leukemia stem cells (c-Kit(+) cells, LSCs). Importantly, we also observed that a higher level of Six1 in human patients predicts a worse prognosis. Notably, knockdown of Six1 significantly prolonged the survival of MLL-AF9-induced AML mice with reduced peripheral infiltration and tumor burden. AML cells from Six1-knockdown (KD) mice displayed a significantly decreased number and function of LSC, as assessed by the immunophenotype, colony-forming ability and limiting dilution assay. Further analysis revealed the augmented apoptosis of LSC and decreased expression of glycolytic genes in Six1 KD mice. Overall, our data showed that Six1 is essential for the progression of MLL-AF9-induced AML via maintaining the pool of LSC.","[""2016YFA0100600/Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of"", 'China', ""2017YFA0103402/Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of"", 'China', ""2018YFA0107801/Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of"", 'China', '2016-I2M-1-017/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical', 'Sciences', '2017-I2M-3-015/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical', 'Sciences', '2017-I2M-3-018/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical', 'Sciences', '2018PT31003/Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities', '3332018199/Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities', '81629001/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81600136/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81670120/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770105/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81421002/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '17JCQNJC09800/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City', '18ZXDBSY00070/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City']",PMC6609858,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL-rearranged leukemia', 'Six1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'glycolysis', 'leukemia stem cell']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6239-1519', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8288-5022']","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 39 patients with MPN-AP/BP treated frontline with AZA at the standard dosage (75 mg/m(2) ). Median time from diagnosis to AP/BP evolution was 92.3 months (IR 29.9-180.1). All patients were evaluable for hematologic response: two patients (5.2%) died early after AZA initiation, 13 patients (33.3%) had a progressive or stable disease, nine (23.1%) had a hematologic improvement (HI), seven (17.9%) achieved a partial response (PR), and eight (20.5%) a complete response (CR). Overall, 24 patients achieved a clinical hematologic response (HI + PR + CR), with an overall response rate of 61.5%. Median overall survival (OS) from AZA start of the whole cohort was 13.5 months (95% CI, 8.2-18.7). There was no difference in median OS among patients with HI, PR, or CR (P = .908). These three subgroups as ""responders"" having been considered, a significantly better OS was observed in responder compared with nonresponder patients, with a median OS of 17.6 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.0) versus 4.1 months (95% CI, 0.4-10.0) (P = .001) Only female gender was significant for both achievement of response (.010) and OS duration (P = .002). In conclusion, AZA is useful for the management of MPN-AP/BP, with an overall response rate (HI + PR + CR) of 61.5% and a longer OS in responders.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['accelerated phase', 'azacytidine', 'blastic phase', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2876-4833', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7741-862X']","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and economic outcomes associated with the use of isavuconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk immunocompromised patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Retrospective, single-centre cohort study of patients who received isavuconazole prophylaxis. Outcomes assessed included breakthrough IFI, early discontinuation of isavuconazole for any reason and antifungal prophylaxis prescribed at discharge. The impact on inpatient drug expenditure was evaluated using current isavuconazole and posaconazole drug costs per observed isavuconazole days of therapy (DOT) during the study period. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight courses of isavuconazole prophylaxis were administered to 98 inpatients (2193 DOT). Relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukaemia was the indication for prophylaxis in over half (59.4%) of patients. Breakthrough IFI occurred in 8 (5.8%) courses. Suspected drug-related toxicities led to early discontinuation in 6 (4.3%) courses (five hepatotoxicity, one drug rash). At discharge, 24 (17.4%) courses lacked insurance coverage for isavuconazole. The formulary switch to isavuconazole prophylaxis resulted in an estimated mean drug cost savings of $128.25 per DOT relative to estimated posaconazole costs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Isavuconazole may be an option for antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk immunocompromised adults and has the potential to produce significant inpatient drug cost savings. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole in this role.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antifungal agents', 'isavuconazole', 'systemic infection']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0069-4594', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2965-1355']",['(c) 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jul 12.,"AIMS: Rituximab is standard care in a number of lymphoma subtypes, including follicular lymphoma (FL), although many patients are resistant to rituximab, or develop resistance with repeated treatment, and a high proportion relapse. Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with improved efficacy over rituximab. It is approved for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and for use with bendamustine in patients with rituximab-relapsed/refractory FL. METHODS: Using a previously described population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of obinutuzumab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL, we conducted an exposure-response analysis using data from 6 clinical trials in patients with CD20+ B-cell malignancies (CLL11, GADOLIN, GATHER, GAUDI, GAUGUIN and GAUSS) to describe the PK properties of obinutuzumab, identify covariates influencing exposure, and explore how exposure affects safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamics. RESULTS: A 2-compartment model with linear and time-dependent clearance described obinutuzumab PK. Disease type and subtype, body weight, baseline tumour size, and sex had the largest effects on PK. Obinutuzumab exposure was not associated with occurrence or severity of adverse events, but higher exposure appeared to be associated with greater efficacy, particularly longer progression-free survival. However, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, progression-free survival benefit in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine arm was independent of exposure. CONCLUSION: The updated population PK model reported here accurately describes the PK of obinutuzumab patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL. The selected obinutuzumab dosing regimen offers clinical benefit in a majority of rituximab-refractory FL patients treated with bendamustine, irrespective of variability in exposure, whilst minimising adverse events.",,PMC6710522,,['NOTNLM'],"['*drug exposure', '*follicular lymphoma', '*obinutuzumab', '*pharmacokinetics']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7018-9687'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Richter syndrome (RS) indicates the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma (mostly DLBCL). Richter syndrome is a rare complication with an aggressive clinical course, bearing an unfavorable prognosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for it. As a novel cellular-based immune therapy, chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CART) cells treatment is gradually used in treating hematological malignancies, especially in CD19(+) B-cell malignancy. Therefore, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CART-19) treatment is promising to be used as a new method for RS patients. In our study, one RS patient expressing high level of CD19 molecule was enrolled in clinical trial; he has received a series of treatments but did not achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect. The patient totally received 3.55 x 10(8) autologous CART-19 cells infusion. After CART-19 infusion, the mainly clinical side effect was repeated fever. The maximal duration period was 24 days and the highest temperature was 40.1 degrees C. Pancytopenia and significantly serum cytokines level rise were observed, including IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10. Before discharge, the level of cytokines reduced to normal levels. In addition, we detected the serum biochemical indices as like K(+) , Ca(2+) , creatinine, and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, all of these indices were normal. This showed that there was no tumor necrosis syndrome after treatment. The proportion of B cells in patient's peripheral blood decreased from 72% to 40.2% after infusion, co-occurring with reduction in lymph nodes and hematopoietic reconstitution. Based on the recent revolution in the therapeutic landscape for hematological malignancies including B-cell lymphomas, CART-CD19 cell therapy as a new therapeutic option for RS might be available in the coming years. It aims to reduce patient's tumor burden, prolong their survival time, and provide opportunities for other sequential therapy such as chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.",,PMC6558585,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CART-19: CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells', '*CART: chimeric antigen receptor-modified T', '*Richter syndrome', '*cytokines']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6760-0153'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The survival rate at 150 months was 82.02%, and we found that phase at diagnosis (beta: 0.447, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 0.088, 0.806; P = 0.015), prognostic scales (Sokal [P = 0.021] and Hasford [beta: 0.369, 95% CI: 0.049, 0.688; P = 0.024]) and hematological response at 3 months (beta: 0.717, 95% CI: 0.443, 0.991; P < 0.001), but not molecular response (P = 0.834 for 6 months, P = 0.927 for 12 months, P = 0.250 for 18 months), were independently associated with overall survival. Survival analysis in subsets, according to the initial phase (chronic, accelerated and blastic phase) did not show any effect according to prognostic scales (P > 0.05). Mexican patients with CML have repeatedly been diagnosed at earlier ages. Prognostic factors in CML may differ according to the ethnic or geographical context. We found that phase at diagnosis, prognostic scale and hematological response at 3 months were independent predictors of survival.",,PMC6558595,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*hispanic', '*overall survival', '*prognostic factors']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6517-156X'],['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Maintenance of a balanced expression of the two isoforms of the transcription factor GATA-1, the full-length protein (GATA-1FL ) and a shorter isoform (GATA-1 S ), contributes to control hematopoiesis, whereas their dysregulation can alter the differentiation/proliferation potential of hematopoietic precursors thereby eventually leading to a variety of hematopoietic disorders. Although it is well established that these isoforms play opposite roles in these remarkable processes, most of the molecular pathways involved remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GATA-1FL and GATA-1S are able to differently influence intracellular redox states and reactive oxygen species (ROS) compartmentation in the erythroleukemic K562 cell line, thus shedding novel mechanistic insights into the processes of cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance in myeloid precursors. Furthermore, given the role played by ROS signaling as a strategy to escape apoptosis and evade cell-mediated immunity in myeloid cells, this study highlights a mechanism through which aberrant expression of GATA-1 isoforms could play a role in the leukemogenic process.",,PMC6767011,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GATA-1', '*mitochondria remodeling', '*myeloid leukemia', '*oxidative stress', '*succinate dehydrogenase subunit C (SDHC)']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1664-1657'],"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Jul 25.,"BACKGROUND: The malignant mechanisms that control the development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are beginning to be identified. Recent evidence suggests that disturbances in specific intracellular signalling pathways, such as RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase, T-cell receptor (TCR)-phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CTCL. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanisms controlling disease development and progression in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common form of CTCL. METHODS: We collected 100 samples that were submitted for diagnosis of, or a second opinion regarding, MF between 2001 and 2018, 80% of which were in the early clinical stages of the disease. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were used for histological review and to measure the expression by immunohistochemistry of surrogate markers of activation of the TCR-PLCG1-NFAT, JAK-STAT and NF-kappaB pathways. Folliculotropism and large-cell transformation were also examined. RESULTS: NFAT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) markers showed a comparable activation status in early and advanced stages, while STAT3 activation was more frequent in advanced stages and was associated with large-cell transformation. Consistently with this observation, STAT3 activation occurred in parallel with MF progression in two initially MF-negative cases. A significant association of NFAT with NF-kappaB markers was also found, reflecting a common mechanism of activation in the two pathways. Genomic studies identified nine mutations in seven genes known to play a potential role in tumorigenesis in T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, including PLCG1, JAK3 and STAT3, which underlies the activation of these key cell-survival pathways. A higher mutational allele frequency was detected in advanced stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that STAT3 is activated in advanced cases and is associated with large-cell transformation, while the activation of NFAT and NF-kappaB is maintained throughout the disease. These findings could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. What's already known about this topic? Mycosis fungoides is characterized by a clonal expansion of T cells in the skin. The mechanisms controlling disease development and progression are not fully understood. What does this study add? An association of the nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor kappa B pathways was found, which could reflect a common mechanism of activation. These pathways were activated in early and advanced stages at the same level. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation was associated with large-cell transformation and was more frequent in advanced stages. A genomic analysis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated genes was performed. Nine mutations were detected. What is the translational message? These results could have important implications for the treatment of MF in the near future.","['SAF2013-47416-R/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'Plan Estatal I + D + I 2013-2016/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y', 'Competitividad/International', 'PI14/00221/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'PIE14/0064/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'PIE15/0081/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'PIE16/01294/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'FIS 17/0957/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad/International', 'Asociacion Espanola Contra el Cancer (AECC)/International', 'Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid and Instituto Formacion e', 'Investigacion/International', 'NVAL16/18/Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL)/International']",,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6641-2073', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6531-2062']",['(c) 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.'],,,,,,['Br J Dermatol. 2020 Jan;182(1):16-17.

We now have ample prospective data using targeted therapy to critically evaluate whether prior prognostic biomarkers remain relevant. High-risk features do not have the same magnitude of effect on clinical outcomes in the era of targeted therapy when compared to chemoimmunotherapy.

Flavonoid morin is known to inhibit growth of cancer cells, including lung cancer and breast cancer. Herein, we hypothesized that morin can inhibit cancer activities in melanoma by altering ROS generation. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of morin and its underlying mechanisms in melanoma cells. Effects of morin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined using standardized assays. Changes in pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins were analyzed by western blot analysis. Cellular ROS levels and mitochondrial function were evaluated by measuring DCF-DA fluorescence and rhodamine-123 fluorescence intensities, respectively. Morin induced ROS production and apoptosis, as presented by increased proportion of cells with Annexin V-PE(+) staining and sub-G0/G1 peak in cell cycle analysis. It also downregulated Sp1, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 but upregulated cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and PUMA.

BMF can be caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which results in an expansion of hypoxic regions in the BM. Because of this hypoxic presentation, there is potential for improved characterization of BMF through in vivo assessment of oxygenation in the BM cavity. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can provide local assessment of intravascular oxygen saturation (SO2), which has been shown to correlate with pimonidazole-assessed hypoxia. This study introduces an optimized PA imaging technique to assess SO2 within the femoral BM cavity through disease progression in a murine model of ALL.

Thrombosis typically occurs in small to medium vessels; thrombosis of large vessels is rare. Case Presentation: A 75-year-old woman with ET complicated by bilateral retinal vein occlusion was evaluated for fatigue, early satiety, and unintentional weight loss. Her hypertension was well controlled, and her chronic lower extremity claudication from peripheral artery disease was stable. She reported adherence to aspirin 81 mg and hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily, and her platelets (375 x 10(9)/L) were at goal. Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with ET without progression to myelofibrosis or leukemia. CT abdomen demonstrated complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta, extending into the common iliac arteries, with reconstitution of flow distally via collaterals. The addition of clopidogrel, for platelet inhibition, and cilostazol, for claudication, caused symptom improvement without further thrombosis or bleeding. Discussion: There are few published reports of ET complicated by aortic thrombosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of aortic thrombosis occurring in an ET patient with normal platelet count on antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapies. There is limited evidence to guide treatment, but medical management with triple antiplatelet therapy may be effective in selected patients.",,PMC6458875,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3479-9557', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1887-8869']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, subtype classification is important and indispensable in ALL diagnosis. In our previous study, we identified some marker genes in childhood ALL by means of microarray technology and, furthermore, detected the relative expression levels of 57 marker genes and built a comparatively convenient and cost-effective classifier with a prediction accuracy as high as 94% based on the advanced fragment analysis (AFA) technique. Methods: A more convenient improved AFA (iAFA) technique with one-step multiplex RT-PCR and an anti-contamination system was developed to detect 57 marker genes for ALL. Results: The iAFA assay is much easier and more convenient to perform than the previous AFA assay and has a prediction accuracy of 95.29% in ALL subtypes. The anti-contamination system could effectively prevent the occurrence of lab DNA contamination. We also showed that marker gene expression profiles in pediatric ALL revealed 2 subgroups with different outcomes. Most ALL patients (95.8%) had a good-risk genetic profile, and only 4.2% of ALL patients had a poor-risk genetic profile, which predicted an event-free survival (EFS) of 93.6 +/- 1.3% vs 18.8 +/- 9.8% at 5 years, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared to the previous AFA assay, the iAFA technique is more functional, time-saving and labor-saving.

Mutations of RUNX1 cause ~10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a particularly poor prognosis. The current paradigm for the leukemogenesis is that insufficient activity of wild-type (WT) RUNX1 impairs hematopoietic differentiation. The majority of mutant RUNX1 proteins lose the DNA-binding affinity and inhibit WT RUNX1 by depletion of CBFbeta. Here, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantitatively study the interactions of WT and three clinical mutant RUNX1, CBFbeta and DNA. Our data show that the binding of RUNX1 to DNA is enthalpy-driven, and the affinity decreases in the order of WT > S114L > R139Q >> K83E, which support previous observations and conclusion. To find potentially beneficial RUNX1 mutations that could increase the overall RUNX1 activity, K83R and H179K mutations of RUNX1 were designed, using structure-based computational modeling, and found to possess significantly higher DNA-binding affinities than does WT RUNX1. K83R and H179K mutant RUNX1 could therefore be protein-based RUNX1 activators.",,PMC6497270,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8141-3584'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the genetic composition of NPM1 mutated (NPM1(mut)) AML, we assess mutation status of five recurrently mutated oncogenes in 129 paired NPM1(mut) samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse. We find a substantial shift in the genetic pattern from diagnosis to relapse including NPM1(mut) loss (n = 11). To better understand these NPM1(mut) loss cases, we perform whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. At the time of relapse, NPM1(mut) loss patients (pts) feature distinct mutational patterns that share almost no somatic mutation with the corresponding diagnosis sample and impact different signaling pathways. In contrast, profiles of pts with persistent NPM1(mut) are reflected by a high overlap of mutations between diagnosis and relapse. Our findings confirm that relapse often originates from persistent leukemic clones, though NPM1(mut) loss cases suggest a second ""de novo"" or treatment-associated AML (tAML) as alternative cause of relapse.",,PMC6497712,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4759-5254'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the use of fertility preservation is very low among Chinese male cancer patients. Additionally, the cumulative rate of frozen sperm use is also low. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study by collecting available information at the Human Sperm Bank, National Research Institute for Family Planning from July 2006 to December 2017 to examine the data in China. RESULTS A total 145 male cancer patients underwent sperm cryopreservation. The patients were 29.3+/-6.9 years old, and 6.2% (9 out of 145) of the patients were adolescents under the age of 18 years old. As of June 2018, only 9.7% (14 out of 145) of patients returned to use their cryopreserved sperm for assisted reproduction technology (ART). Of the 33 ART cycles, conceptions were achieved in 51.5% (17 out of 33), and the rate of patients who had a baby was 71.4% (10 out of 14). The data indicate men with testicular cancer or leukemia had lower total sperm counts and recovery rate of progressive sperm than did men with other types of cancer, while men with sarcoma had the lowest progressive sperm. CONCLUSIONS The physician should make an effort to promote fertility preservation for male cancer patients in China. And patients with testicular cancer and leukemia require additional attention.",,PMC6511111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 2.,"The functional diversity of cells that compose myeloid malignancies, i.e., the respective roles of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in this diversity, remains poorly understood. This question is addressed in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a myeloid neoplasm in which clinical diversity contrasts with limited genetic heterogeneity. To generate induced pluripotent stem cell clones, we reprogrammed CD34(+) cells collected from a patient with a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in which whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood monocyte DNA had identified 12 gene mutations, including a mutation in KDM6A and two heterozygous mutations in TET2 in the founding clone and a secondary KRAS(G12D) mutation. CD34(+) cells from an age-matched healthy donor were also reprogrammed. We captured a part of the genetic heterogeneity observed in the patient, i.e. we analyzed five clones with two genetic backgrounds, without and with the KRAS(G12D) mutation. Hematopoietic differentiation of these clones recapitulated the main features of the patient's disease, including overproduction of granulomonocytes and dysmegakaryopoiesis. These analyses also disclosed significant discrepancies in the behavior of hematopoietic cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell clones with similar genetic background, correlating with limited epigenetic changes. These analyses suggest that, beyond the coding mutations, several levels of intraclonal heterogeneity may participate in the yet unexplained clinical heterogeneity of the disease.",['P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6939510,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2020.,"Deletion 5q or monosomy 5 (-5/5q-) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common high-risk feature that is referred to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, -5/5q- is frequently associated with other high-risk cytogenetic aberrations such as complex karyotype, monosomal karyotype, monosomy 7 (-7), or 17p abnormalities (abn (17p)), the significance of which is unknown. In order to address this question, we studied adult patients with AML harboring -5/5q- having their first allogeneic transplantation between 2000 and 2015. Five hundred and one patients with -5/5q- have been analyzed. Three hundred and thirty-eight patients (67%) were in first remission and 142 (28%) had an active disease at time of allogeneic transplantation. The 2-year probabilities of overall survival and leukemia-free survival were 27% and 20%, respectively. The 2-year probability of treatment-related mortality was 20%. We identified four different cytogenetic groups according to additional abnormalities with prognostic impact: -5/5q- without complex karyotype, monosomal karyotype or abn(17p), -5/5q- within a complex karyotype, -5/5q- within a monosomal karyotype and the combination of -5/5q- with abn(17p). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with worse overall survival and leukemia-free survival across the four groups were active disease, age, monosomal karyotype, and abn(17p).

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diag nostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to distinguish between 'normal', pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.",,PMC6886439,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 2.,"The BCL2 family plays important roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor, has received FDA approval for the treatment of AML. However, drug resistance ensues after prolonged treatment, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human AML, we identified genes whose inactivation sensitizes AML blasts to venetoclax. Genes involved in mitochondrial organization and function were significantly depleted throughout our screen, including the mitochondrial chaperonin CLPB. We demonstrated that CLPB is upregulated in human AML, it is further induced upon acquisition of venetoclax resistance, and its ablation sensitizes AML to venetoclax. Mechanistically, CLPB maintains the mitochondrial cristae structure via its interaction with the cristae-shaping protein OPA1, whereas its loss promotes apoptosis by inducing cristae remodeling and mitochondrial stress responses. Overall, our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial architecture may provide a promising approach to circumvent venetoclax resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen reveals genes involved in mitochondrial biological processes participate in the acquisition of venetoclax resistance. Loss of the mitochondrial protein CLPB leads to structural and functional defects of mitochondria, hence sensitizing AML cells to apoptosis. Targeting CLPB synergizes with venetoclax and the venetoclax/azacitidine combination in AML in a p53-independent manner.See related commentary by Savona and Rathmell, p. 831.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.","['R01 CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA202027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA228135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA216421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007491/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR023704/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD010582/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6606342,['NIHMS1528706'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6260-338X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9946-9498', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6319-8331', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7512-8477']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Cancer Discov. 2019 Jul;9(7):831-833.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"To study mechanisms underlying resistance to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify gene knockouts resulting in drug resistance. We validated TP53, BAX, and PMAIP1 as genes whose inactivation results in venetoclax resistance in AML cell lines. Resistance to venetoclax resulted from an inability to execute apoptosis driven by BAX loss, decreased expression of BCL2, and/or reliance on alternative BCL2 family members such as BCL2L1. The resistance was accompanied by changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular metabolism. Evaluation of TP53 knockout cells for sensitivities to a panel of small-molecule inhibitors revealed a gain of sensitivity to TRK inhibitors. We relate these observations to patient drug responses and gene expression in the Beat AML dataset. Our results implicate TP53, the apoptotic network, and mitochondrial functionality as drivers of venetoclax response in AML and suggest strategies to overcome resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: AML is challenging to treat due to its heterogeneity, and single-agent therapies have universally failed, prompting a need for innovative drug combinations. We used a genetic approach to identify genes whose inactivation contributes to drug resistance as a means of forming preferred drug combinations to improve AML treatment.See related commentary by Savona and Rathmell, p. 831.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.","['F30 CA239335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA108947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6606338,['NIHMS1528705'],,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8105-2440', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6400-3161', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8331-8206', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3783-1820', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2133-0960']",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective case series. Diagnosis of VIVCPP was confirmed by laryngoscopy in all children. RESULTS: Less than 20 cases of VIVCPP in children have been previously documented in the literature. Of the three children in our case series, one had unilateral vincristine-induced vocal cord paresis and two had bilateral VIVCPP. The first two patients each had two separate episodes of paresis, lasting 4 months and 1 month respectively. In the last patient, whose medical course was complicated by many additional factors, vocal cord paralysis persisted for over three years. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must evaluate children with suspected VIVCPP for concomitant symptoms and signs of vincristine neuropathies and examine the vocal cords via laryngoscopy. The effects of vincristine neurotoxicity can be waxing and waning, demonstrate delayed onset and persist well beyond drug cessation.

Epub 2019 Apr 29.,"The complex defense mechanism of the DNA damage response (DDR) developed by cells during long-term evolution is an important mechanism for maintaining the stability of the genome. Defects in the DDR pathway can lead to the occurrence of various diseases, including tumor development. Most cancer treatments cause DNA damage and apoptosis. However, cancer cells have the natural ability to repair this damage and inhibit apoptosis, ultimately leading to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, investigating the mechanism of DNA damage may contribute markedly to the future treatment of cancer. The CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex formed by B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) regulates apoptosis by activating NF-kappaB signaling. BCL10 is involved in the formation of complexes that antagonize apoptosis and contribute to cell survival after DNA damage, with cytoplasmic BCL10 entering the nucleus to promote DNA damage repair, including histone ubiquitination and the recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair factors. This article reviews the role of BCL10 in cell survival following DNA damage.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL10', 'DDR', 'HR', 'NF-kappaB', 'RNF8/RNF168']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Chronic leukoencephalopathy is a potential devastating late effect that can manifest as a range of neurological and neurocognitive sequelae. Survivors of the acute lymphocytic leukemia, central nervous system tumors, and stem cell transplant have frequently been exposed to cranial radiation, systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, which places them at risk of developing chronic leukoencephalopathy. Defining leukoencephalopathy and its neuroimaging characteristics, the population of survivors at risk, its long-term consequences, and identifying prevention and intervention strategies can potentially mitigate the morbidity of these survivors.

The purpose of this study was to describe leukemic retinal hemorrhages using multimodal imaging and to monitor their evolution longitudinally. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 eyes of 7 symptomatic leukemic patients with posterior segment hemorrhages. METHODS: Single-center study performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Symptomatic leukemic patients with posterior segment hemorrhages underwent serial dilated fundus examinations. The hemorrhages were documented longitudinally with color fundus photographs and spectral-domain (SD) OCT. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Microanatomic locations of leukemic retinal hemorrhages and their impact on vision and evolution over time. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients (71.4% men; 57.1% white, 28.6% black, and 14.3% Hispanic) were included, with 11 eyes showing posterior segment hemorrhages. The median age at presentation was 49.8 years. All patients had intraretinal hemorrhages; these involved the vitreous and sub-internal limiting membrane (ILM) space in 1 and 3 patients, respectively. The median total follow-up duration was 4.0 months. At the final follow-up visits, 4 of 6 patients showed complete resolution of hemorrhages on examination and color fundus photographs. The final SD-OCT images of all patients did not show any retinal thinning, disruption of the ellipsoid zone, disorganization of the retinal layers, intraretinal fluid, or subretinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic leukemic retinal hemorrhages are associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. These hemorrhages, including visually significant central sub-ILM hemorrhages, tend to be self-limiting and resolve within a few months with treatment of the underlying disease.",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Epub 2017 Aug 5.,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of ocular manifestations and the association of these manifestations with hematologic parameters among patients with leukemia attending a hemato-oncology unit at a tertiary care government hospital in South India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: All patients attending a hemato-oncology unit at a tertiary care government hospital in South India who were diagnosed with acute or chronic leukemia that was confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy. METHODS: Consecutive patients with leukemia presenting at the hematology clinic underwent standardized leukemia blood workup and comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation. Patient demographics, the type of leukemia, ophthalmic features, and hematological parameters such as hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, and platelet counts were recorded. The association between ophthalmic manifestations and blood counts was analyzed using multivariable regression analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study measured the prevalence of various ocular manifestations in different types of leukemias and their association with hematologic parameters. RESULTS: In total, 133 eyes of 133 patients were examined during the study period. The prevalence of leukemic ophthalmopathy was found to be 68% in cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 42% in cases of acute lymphoid leukemia, 33% in cases of chronic lymphoid leukemia, and 13% in cases of chronic myeloid leukemia. Vision-threatening complications such as subhyaloid hemorrhage involving the posterior pole (20%) and vitreous hemorrhage (10%) were seen exclusively in patients with acute leukemias. Multivariable logistic regression after adjusting for the type of leukemia, patient age, and white blood cell and platelet counts showed that the hemoglobin level was the only factor predictive of developing subhyaloid hemorrhage (every 1-g/L increment increase in hemoglobin level led to a 30% reduction in the likelihood of developing subhyaloid hemorrhage; 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.9; P = 0.02). The probability of developing subhyaloid hemorrhage was reduced by >50% when hemoglobin level improved from 5 to 7 g/L and when platelet count improved from 10 000 to 50 000 cells/mm(3) for both types of acute leukemia. There was no association between white blood cell counts and ophthalmic manifestations. CONCLUSION: Leukemic ophthalmopathy is more common in acute and myeloid cases and less common in chronic and lymphoid subtypes. It is predominantly due to secondary rheological changes. Blood transfusion should be considered when hemoglobin level and platelet count decrease below 7 g/L and 50 000 cells/mm(3), respectively, to prevent vision-threatening complications. Patients with acute leukemias should undergo ophthalmic screening at baseline and then periodically to prevent visual morbidity.",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Epub 2019 Apr 1.,"BCR/ABL(p210) fusion gene, the characteristic biomarker of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), contains two different transcription isoforms, e13a2 and e14a2, which lead to differences in the pathological features and response to targeted drug. At present, there is short of simple and fast technology to distinguish these two transcript isoforms. In this paper, RNA fusion-triggered rolling circle amplification (RF-RCA) strategy was developed to distinguish e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts directly from RNA extraction in one step. The simultaneous binding of dumbbell template and corresponding primer with target fused RNA can induce their proximal hybridization and trigger the RCA to produce lots of tandem repeat G-quadruplexes sequences for real time fluorescence readout with the interaction of Thioflavin T and G-quadruplex. The proposed strategy can detect as low as 0.1 aM target and discriminate e13a2 (0.01%) and e14a2 (0.1%) transcript isoforms directly from complex genomic RNA extraction, proving high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the RF-RNA was successfully applied to analyze BCR/ABL(p210) isoforms from clinical samples for accurately molecular subtyping and monitoring the response of imatinib treatment. The developed RF-RCA strategy presented an ultrasensitive, accurate and pragmatic toolbox to simple and rapid discriminate BCR/ABL(p210) fusion isoforms for promoting clinical research and personalized treatment of CML.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL(p210) fusion gene', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Real time fluorescence', 'Rolling circle amplification', 'Transcript isoforms']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Mar 6.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Leukaemia is a disease found worldwide; it is a type of cancer that originates in the bone marrow and is characterised by an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells (leukocytes). In order to correctly identify this abnormality, haematologists examine blood smears from patients. A diagnosis obtained by this method may be influenced by factors such as the experience and level of fatigue of the haematologist, resulting in non-standard reports and even errors. In the literature, several methods have been proposed that involve algorithms to diagnose this disease. However, no reviews or surveys have been conducted. This paper therefore presents an empirical investigation of computational methods focusing on the segmentation of leukocytes. METHODS: In our study, 15 segmentation methods were evaluated using five public image databases: ALL-IDB2, BloodSeg, Leukocytes, JTSC Database and CellaVision. Following the standard methodology for literature evaluation, we conducted a pixel-level segmentation evaluation by comparing the segmented image with its corresponding ground truth. In order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we performed an evaluation using six evaluation metrics: accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, kappa, Dice, and true positive rate. RESULTS: The segmentation algorithms performed significantly differently for different image databases, and for each database, a different algorithm achieved the best results. Moreover, the two best methods achieved average accuracy values higher than 97%, with an excellent kappa index. Also, the average Dice index indicated that the similarity between the segmented leukocyte and its ground truth was higher than 0.85 for these two methods This result confirms the high level of similarity between these images but does not guarantee that a method has segmented all leukocyte nuclei. We also found that the method that performed best segmented only 58.44% of all leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Of the techniques used to segment leukocytes, we note that clustering algorithms, the Otsu threshold, simple arithmetic operations and region growing are the approaches most widely used for this purpose. However, these computational methods have not yet overcome all the challenges posed by this problem.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Clustering algorithms', 'Leukocyte', 'Mathematical morphology', 'Otsu threshold', 'Segmentation']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Apr 17.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent of pediatric cancers. Neuroepithelial cell-transforming 1 (NET1) has been associated with malignancy in a number of cancers, but the role of NET1 in ALL development is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of NET1 gene in ALL cell proliferation and chemoresistance. We analyzed GEO microarray data comparing bone marrow expression profiles of pediatric B-cell ALL samples and those of age-matched controls. MTT and colony formation assays were performed to analyze cell proliferation. ELISA assays, Western blot analyses, and TUNEL staining were used to detect chemoresistance. We confirmed that NET1 was targeted by miR-206 using Western blot and luciferase reporter assays. We identified NET1 gene as one of the most significantly elevated genes in pediatric B-ALL. MTT and colony formation assays demonstrated that NET1 overexpression increases B-ALL cell proliferation in Nalm-6 cells. ELISA assays, Western blot analyses, and TUNEL staining showed that NET1 contributes to ALL cell doxorubicin resistance, whereas NET1 inhibition reduces resistance. Using the TargetScan database, we found that several microRNAs (miRNAs) were predicted to target NET1, including microRNA-206 (miR-206), which has been shown to regulate cancer development. To determine whether miR-206 targets NET1 in vitro, we transfected Nalm-6 cells with miR-206 or its inhibitor miR-206-in. Western blot assays showed that miR-206 inhibits NET1 expression and miR-206-in increases NET1 expression. Luciferase assays using wild-type or mutant 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of NET1 confirmed these findings. We ultimately found that miR-206 inhibits B-ALL cell proliferation and chemoresistance induced by NET1. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that NET1 enhances proliferation and chemoresistance in B-ALL cells and that miR-206 regulates these effects by targeting NET1. This study therefore not only contributes to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying B-ALL progression but also opens the possibility for developing curative interventions.",,PMC7848433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 17.,"Arylidene analogs are well proven for biological activities. FCY-302, a novel small molecule belonging to this class, was screened for its biological efficacy in leukemia and myeloma cells. FCY-302 selectively inhibited proliferation of cancer cells with GI50 values of 395.2 nM, 514.6 Nm, and 642.4 nM in HL-60, Jurkat, and RPMI-8226 cells, respectively. The compound also increased sub-G0 peak in the cancer cell cycle and favored apoptosis determined by annexin V assay. The compound decreased the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 levels and increased proapoptotic Bax proteins in leukemia and myeloma cell lines. FCY-302 attenuated the mitochondrial membrane-bound Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, Ca(2+) ATPase, and Mg(2+) ATPase enzyme activities and significantly decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GR, and GST in all the three cancer cells tested. Our findings suggest that FCY-302 inhibits the proliferation of leukemia and myeloma cancer cells by altering key mitochondrial and antioxidant enzymes, eventually driving them to apoptosis. These results drive focus on FCY-302 and its analogs to be developed as potential small molecules with bioactivities against cancer.",,PMC7848260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study with VRE molecular strain typing and gastrointestinal microbiome comparison. SETTING: A regional referral center for acute leukemia. PATIENTS: 342 consecutive patients admitted with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. METHODS: In September 2015, we changed our empiric antibiotic of choice for neutropenic fever from a carbapenem to the cycling regimen. We studied 214 consecutive patients during the carbapenem period and 128 during the cycling period. Surveillance for VRE stool colonization was conducted weekly. Representative stool samples were analyzed for VRE MLST types and changes in the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota. RESULTS: The change in empiric antibiotics was associated with a significant decrease in VRE colonization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.66), a switch in the dominant VRE MLST types on the unit, and some modifications in the gastrointestinal microbiome. There were no differences in total gram-positive or gram-negative BSIs. During the carbapenem period, we observed higher absolute numbers of Candida spp and fewer ESBL BSIs, but these did not reach statistical significance. Patients during the carbapenem period had longer lengths of stay and durations of severe neutropenia and 10% higher hospital cost. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-sparing empiric antibiotic regimens may have advantages related to VRE ecology, gastrointestinal dysbiosis, duration of neutropenia, cost and length of stay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recommended comprehensive neuropsychological testing can be time- and cost- intensive for both institutions and patients and their families. It is important to find quick and easily administered surveillance measures to identify those in need of evaluation. METHODS: We evaluated, individually and in combination, the sensitivity and specificity of the 1) Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning-Metacognition Index (BRIEF-MCI), and 2) CogState Composite Index (computerized assessment of cognition) in identifying below grade-level performance on state-administered tests of reading and mathematics among childhood cancer survivors. RESULTS: The 45 participants (39% female) were a mean age of 7.1 +/- 4.4 years at diagnosis, 14.0 +/- 3.0 at evaluation, with a history of leukemia (58%), lymphoma (9%), central nervous system tumors (20%), and other tumors (13%). Impairment on the BRIEF-MCI was associated with low sensitivity (26% reading, 41% mathematics) but stronger specificity (88% reading, 96% mathematics). We found similar associations for the CogState Composite Index with sensitivity of 26% for reading and 29% for mathematics and specificity of 92% for both reading and mathematics. Combining the two measures did not improve sensitivity appreciably (47% reading, 59% mathematics) while reducing specificity (84% reading, 88% mathematics). CONCLUSIONS: While individuals identified from the BRIEF-MCI or CogState Composite would likely benefit from a full neuropsychological evaluation given the strong specificity, use of these measures as screening tools is limited. With poor sensitivity, they do not identify many patients with academic difficulties and in need of a full neuropsychological evaluation. Continued effort is required to find screening measures that have both strong sensitivity and specificity.","['UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', ""Scholar's Award/St. Baldrick's Foundation""]",PMC6498488,,['NOTNLM'],"['Computerized assessment', 'Late effects', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological evaluation', 'Survivorship']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3703-2623'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological differences between MRD-positive and MRD-negative B ALL patients at the EOI are not known at present. This prospective study evaluated the association of ALC and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset percentage at the EOI with MRD. ALC was done at baseline, day 8, and day 15 and at EOI. Assessment for MRD and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset was done at EOI. In 2-year study duration, 197 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were recruited out of which 150 were analyzed. Peripheral lymphocyte subset percentage was available for 58 patients. We found that ALC at baseline, day 8, day 15, and EOI was not associated with MRD. Day 8 ALC was significantly higher in poor steroid responders (day 8 blasts > 1 x 10(9) cells/l) (p < 0.0001). At the EOI, CD4(-)CD8(+) cell percentage in peripheral blood were significantly higher in MRD-positive patients than MRD-negative patients (p = 0.01). Our study suggests that ALC at any point is not a surrogate marker for MRD. Immunologically MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients differ in CD4(-)CD8(+) cells. The role of CD8(+)T and TCRalphabetaCD3(+)T cells in eliminating residual leukemic cells need to be studied further by functional assays.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Absolute lymphocyte count', 'B ALL', 'minimal residual disease', 'peripheral blood lymphocyte', 'steroid response']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, drug screening efforts to identify novel antileukemic agents have been hampered by the lack of a suitable high-throughput screening platform for suspension cells that does not rely on flow-cytometry analyses. We report the development of a novel leukemia cell-based high-throughput chemical screening platform for the discovery of cell cycle phase specific inhibitors that utilizes chemical cell cycle profiling. We have used this approach to analyze the cell cycle response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells to each of 181420 druglike compounds. This approach yielded cell cycle phase specific inhibitors of leukemia cell proliferation. Further analyses of the top G2-phase and M-phase inhibitors identified the leukemia specific inhibitor 1 (Leusin-1). Leusin-1 arrests cells in G2 phase and triggers an apoptotic cell death. Most importantly, Leusin-1 was more active in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells than other types of leukemias, non-blood cancers, or normal cells and represents a lead molecule for developing antileukemic drugs.","['P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6884739,['NIHMS1057541'],,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2158-889X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, rank in the top five among genes that were mutated in CHIP. This review focuses on mechanisms by which mutant p53 promotes CHIP progression and drives the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: TP53 was frequently mutated in individuals with CHIP. Although clinical studies suggest that expansion of HSCs with TP53 mutations predisposes the elderly to hematological neoplasms, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which TP53 mutations promote HSC expansion. Recent findings suggest that several cellular stressors, including hematopoietic transplantation, genotoxic stress, and inflammation, promote the expansion of HSCs with TP53 mutations. Further, TP53 mutations identified in CHIP cooperate with genetic and/or epigenetic changes in leukemogenesis. SUMMARY: TP53 mutations identified in CHIP are associated with increased risks of de novo and therapy-related hematological neoplasms. Thus, targeting mutant p53 and related pathways holds great potential in preventing CHIP progression and treating hematological malignancies.",['R56 DK119524/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD is characterized by activation, expansion, cytokine production and migration of alloreactive donor T cells, and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allo-HCT. Hence, strategies to limit oxidative stress in GVHD are highly desirable. Thioredoxin1 (Trx1) counteracts oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulating other enzymes that metabolize H2O2. The present study sought to elucidate the role of Trx1 in the pathophysiology of GVHD. Using murine and xenograft models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) and genetic (human Trx1-transgenic, Trx1-Tg) as well as pharmacologic (human recombinant Trx1, RTrx1) strategies; we found that Trx1-Tg donor T cells or administration of the recipients with RTrx1 significantly reduced GVHD severity. Mechanistically, we observed RTrx1 reduced ROS accumulation and cytokine production of mouse and human T cells in response to alloantigen stimulation in vitro. In allo-BMT settings, we found that Trx1-Tg or RTrx1 decreased downstream signaling molecules including NFkappaB activation and T-bet expression, and reduced proliferation, IFN-gamma production and ROS accumulation in donor T cells within GVHD target organs. More importantly, administration of RTrx1 did not impair the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.

Recently, immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox has been introduced to improve the prognosis in relapsed and refractory HCL. Areas covered: This review discusses the mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy of moxetumomab pasudotox in HCL patients. A literature review of the MEDLINE database for articles in English concerning immunotoxins, moxetumomab pasudotox, and hairy cell leukemia was conducted via PubMed. Publications from 2000 through December 2018 were scrutinized. The search terms used were immunotoxins and moxetumomab pasudotox in conjunction with hairy cell leukemia. Conference proceedings from the previous five years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association and American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. Results/conclusion: Moxetumomab pasudotox, a novel recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin, was well tolerated and active in the previous phase 1 and 3 studies in patients with HCL. The drug has been approved in 2018 by the FDA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory HCL who had at least two prior systemic therapies including at least one purine nucleoside analog. Expert opinion: The use of moxetumomab pasudotox is a promising new strategy for the treatment of HCL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anti-CD22 antibody', '*CAT-8015', '*HCL variant', '*cladribine', '*hairy cell leukemia', '*immunotoxin', '*moxetumomab pasudotox', '*pentostatin', '*refractory', '*relapsed', '*rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Construct validity data for the CF-Concerns are few. To add to the literature, an analysis of criterion validity for cognitive complaints (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Cognitive Functioning subscale [EORTC-CF]) and cognitive performance (neuropsychological tests of memory [NIH Toolbox Auditory Verbal Learning Test] and verbal fluency [Controlled Oral Word Association Test]) and discriminant validity (self-reports of negative emotions of anxiety, depression, negative mood) are provided. A two-group comparison design was used. METHOD: Forty-four patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 44 age- and gender-matched noncancer controls completed self-report measures and neuropsychological tests. Spearman's rank correlations (rs) and independent-samples t tests were used. RESULTS: Regarding criterion validity, PROMIS(R)-CF-Concerns significantly correlated with the EORTC-CF (rs = 0.77, p < .001), although not with tests of memory (-0.19) or verbal fluency (0.16). As expected, patients with CLL performed lower than did controls on neuropsychological tests (ps < .05) yet did not differ from controls on PROMIS(R)-CF-Concerns. PROMIS(R)-CF-Concerns was reliably and significantly correlated with negative emotions, with rs ranges across measures of -0.42 to -0.69 for the CLL group and -0.53 to -0.78 for controls. CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS(R)-CF-Concerns exhibited high internal consistency. Criterion validity was evidenced for cognitive complaints though not for cognitive performance as assessed here. In summary, the analysis supports the criterion validity of PROMIS(R)-CF-Concerns for cognitive complaints. It also covaries with self-reports of co-occurring anxiety, depression, and negative mood.

Epub 2019 May 2.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the major causes of brain cancer-related mortality worldwide. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an important agent against GBM. Acquired TMZ-resistance severely limits the chemotherapeutic effect and leads to poor GBM patient survival. To study the underlying mechanism of drug resistance, two TMZ resistant GBM cell lines, A172 and U87, were generated. In this study, the TMZ resistant cells have less apoptosis and cell-cycle change in response to the TMZ treatment. Western blot results revealed that cyclin E1 was upregulation in TMZ resistant cells. Inhibition or depletion of cyclin E1 re-sensitized the resistant cells to the TMZ treatment, which indicated the induction of cyclin E1 is the cause of TMZ resistance in GBM cells. Furthermore, we also found the expression of cyclin E1 stabilized the expression of Mcl-1, which contributes to the TMZ resistance in GBM cells. Finally, our in vivo xenograft data showed that the combination of flavopiridol, a cyclin E1/CDK2 inhibitor, overcomes the TMZ resistant by inducing higher apoptosis. Overall, our data provided a rationale to overcome the TMZ resistant in GBM treatment by inhibiting the cyclin E1 activity.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1', '*cyclin E1', '*glioblastoma', '*temozolomide']",,"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the expression of TMEFF2 in human pancreatic cancer tissue and the effects of knockdown of TMEFF2 on cell, proliferation, and apoptosis in human pancreatic cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-five samples of human pancreatic tissue and adjacent normal pancreatic tissue, and five human pancreatic cancer cell lines, CAPAN1, ASPC1, BXPC3, SW1990, and CFPAC were studied. RNA expression, protein expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and fl ow cytometry, respectively. A co-immunoprecipitation assay evaluated protein interactions. RESULTS TMEFF2 expression was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissue compared with normal pancreas. In human pancreatic cancer cell lines, overexpression of TMEFF2 suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, suppressed the expression of p-STAT3, MCL1, VEGF and increased the expression of the tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase, SHP-1. The co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that TMEFF2 interacted with SHP-1. Knockdown of expression of TMEFF2 resulted in the increased expression of p-STAT3, MCL1, and VEGF, increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis, which were reversed by overexpression of SHP-1. CONCLUSIONS In pancreatic cancer, TMEFF2 exerted as a tumor suppressor effect by regulating p-STAT3, MCL1, and VEGF via SHP-1.",,PMC6510056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 1.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease regarding morphology, immunophenotyping, genetic abnormalities, and clinical behavior. The overall survival rate of pediatric AML is 60% to 70%, and has not significantly improved over the past two decades. Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk of developing acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), which can be preceded by a transient myeloproliferative disorder during the neonatal period. Intensification of current treatment protocols is not feasible due to already high treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Instead, more targeted therapies with less severe side effects are highly needed. PROCEDURE: To identify potential novel therapeutic targets for myeloid disorders in children, including DS-AMKL and non-DS-AML, we performed an unbiased compound screen of 80 small molecules targeting epigenetic regulators in three pediatric AML cell lines that are representative for different subtypes of pediatric AML. Three candidate compounds were validated and further evaluated in normal myeloid precursor cells during neutrophil differentiation and in (pre-)leukemic pediatric patient cells. RESULTS: Candidate drugs LMK235, NSC3852, and bromosporine were effective in all tested pediatric AML cell lines with antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and differentiation effects. Out of these three compounds, the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor NSC3852 specifically induced growth arrest and apoptosis in pediatric AML cells, without disrupting normal neutrophil differentiation. CONCLUSION: NSC3852 is a potential candidate drug for further preclinical testing in pediatric AML and DS-AMKL.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DS-AMKL', '*HDACi', '*NSC3852', '*epigenetic treatment', '*pediatric AML']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6633-1468', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2054-4120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1353-9166', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1869-0957', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8775-1939', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9685-1755']","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 1.,"Eradicating the malignant stem cell is the ultimate challenge in the treatment of leukaemia. Leukaemic stem cells (LSC) hijack the normal haemopoietic niche, where they are mainly protected from cytotoxic drugs. The anti-leukaemic effect of L-asparaginase (ASNase) has been extensively investigated in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but only partially in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We explored the susceptibility of AML-LSC to ASNase as well as the role of the two major cell types that constitute the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, i.e., mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and monocytes/macrophages. Whilst ASNase was effective on both CD34(+) CD38(+) and CD34(+) CD38(-) LSC fractions, MSC and monocytes/macrophages partially counteracted the effect of the drug. Indeed, the production of cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, by BM monocytic cells and by AML cells classified as French-American-British M5 is related to the inactivation of ASNase. Our work demonstrates that, while MSC and monocytes/macrophages may provide a protective niche for AML cells, ASNase has a cytotoxic effect on AML blasts and, importantly, LSC subpopulations. Thus, these features should be considered in the design of future clinical studies aimed at testing ASNase efficacy in AML patients.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*asparaginase', '*bone marrow microenvironment', '*cathepsin B', '*leukaemic stem cells']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2407-236X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8105-6476']",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 2019 Aug;186(3):397-399.

Epub 2019 May 15.,"Considering the role played by the heat shock protein of 70 kDa (HSP70) in cancer, we characterized this protein and its major regulator, the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found both HSP70 and HSF1 overexpressed in CLL patients, correlated to poor prognosis and abnormally localized in the nucleus of leukemic B cells. The two proteins were strictly correlated each other and their levels decreased consensually in those patients responding to in vivo therapeutic regimens. HSP70 and HSF1 inhibition was proved to be effective in inducing a dose-dependent in vitro apoptosis of CLL B cells. Considering that HSF1 is finely regulated by kinases belonging to pathways triggered by rat sarcoma (RAS), we benefited from a previous proteomic study performed in CLL patients aiming to assess the activation/expression of key signaling proteins. We found that patients showing high levels of HSP70 also expressed high Akt-Ser473, thus activating HSF1. Inhibition of PI3K, which activates AKT, reduced the expression of HSF1 and HSP70. By contrast, HSP70-low patients displayed high activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, known to negatively regulate HSF1. These data demonstrate that the HSP70 expression is regulated by the modulation of HSF1 activity through the activation of RAS-regulated pathways and suggest the HSP70/HSF1 interplay as an interesting target for antileukemic therapies. Finally, inhibition of PI3K, that activates AKT, reduced the expression of HSF1 and HSP70.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HSF1', '*HSP70', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*inhibition', '*signal transduction']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7093-2493', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8712-9656']",['(c) 2019 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 1.,"Recent clinical findings in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients suggest that the number and function of immune effector cells are modulated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment. There is further evidence that the success or failure of treatment cessation at least partly depends on the patients immunological constitution. Here, we propose a general ODE model to functionally describe the interactions between immune effector cells with leukemic cells during the TKI treatment of CML. In total, we consider 20 different sub-models, which assume different functional interactions between immune effector and leukemic cells. We show that quantitative criteria, which are purely based on the quality of model fitting, are not able to identify optimal models. On the other hand, the application of qualitative criteria based on a dynamical system framework allowed us to identify nine of those models as more suitable than the others to describe clinically observed patterns and, thereby, to derive conclusion about the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, including aspects of early CML onset, we can demonstrate that certain critical parameters, such as the strength of immune response or leukemia proliferation rate, need to change during CML growth prior to diagnosis, leading to bifurcations that alter the attractor landscape. Finally, we show that the crucial parameters determining the outcome of treatment cessation are not identifiable with tumor load data only, thereby highlighting the need to measure immune cell number and function to properly derive mathematical models with predictive power.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bifurcations', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Immunological control', '*Mathematical modeling', '*Ordinary differential equations', '*Treatment-free remission']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3634-0061'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) observations, along with modeling to further explore the interaction between ibrutinib and rituximab. METHODS: 578 subjects were randomized to ibrutinib or placebo with BR (6 cycles). Ibrutinib PK samples and tumor measurements were obtained from all subjects; a subset was evaluated for bendamustine and rituximab PK. Population rituximab PK was assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: Dose-normalized plasma concentration-time bendamustine data were comparable between the arms. Systemic rituximab exposure was higher with BR-I versus BR; mean trough serum concentrations were 2- to 3-fold higher in the first three cycles and 1.2- to 1.7-fold higher subsequently. No relevant safety differences were observed. In the modeling, including treatment arm as a categorical covariate and tumor burden as a continuous time-varying covariate on overall rituximab clearance significantly improved fitting of the data. CONCLUSIONS: BR-I led to higher dose-normalized systemic rituximab exposure versus BR and more rapid steady-state achievement. The modeling data suggest that rituximab disposition is, at least in part, target mediated. Determining the clinical significance of these findings requires further assessments.

Recent studies have suggested that UTX mutations promote MDS and AML by blocking the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we performed an epigenetic drug library screening for small molecules able to release the differentiation block on HSPCs induced by UTX deficiency. We found that SP2509, a selective inhibitor of LSD1, specifically promoted the differentiation of Utx-null HSPCs while sparing wild-type HSPCs. Transcriptome profiling showed that Utx loss reduced the expression of differentiation-related and tumor suppressor genes, correlating with their potential roles in HSPC self-renewal and leukemogenesis. In contrast, SP2509 treatment reversed these changes in gene expression in Utx-null HSPCs. Accordingly, Utx loss decreased H3K4 methylation level probably through the COMPASS-like complex, while LSD1 inhibition by SP2509 partially reversed the reduction of H3K4 methylation in Utx-deficient HSPCs. Further, SP2509 promoted the differentiation of Utx-null AML cells in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, extended the survival of these leukemic mice. Thus, our study identified a novel strategy to specifically target both premalignant and malignant cells with Utx deficiency for differentiation therapy and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Utx in regulating HSPCs and related diseases.",,PMC6483994,,['NOTNLM'],['*Cancer'],,,,,,,,['Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2019 Apr 26;4:12.

Currently, the application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the Bcr-Abl is the primary therapy for CML patients. However, acquired resistance to TKIs that develops overtime in the long-term administration renders TKIs ineffective to patients with advanced CML. Therefore, increasing studies focus on the amplified expression or activation of Bcr-Abl which is proposed to contribute to the advanced phase. Here, we show that S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) acts as a co-regulator of Bcr-Abl by mediating its K63-linked ubiquitination and activation. Further investigations show that USP10 as a novel deubiquitinase of SKP2 amplifies the activation of Bcr-Abl via mediating deubiquitination and stabilization of SKP2 in CML cells. Moreover, inhibition of USP10 significantly suppresses the proliferation of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, which likely depends on SKP2 status. This findings are confirmed in primary CML cells because these cells are over-expressed with USP10 and SKP2 and are sensitive to a USP10 inhibitor. Taken together, the present study not only provides a novel insight into the amplified activation of Bcr-Abl in CML, but also demonstrates that targeting the USP10/SKP2/Bcr-Abl axis is a potential strategy to overcome imatinib resistance in CML patients.",,PMC6488640,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Drug development']",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that the signaling resulting from the expression of this marker plays an essential role in the development of leukemia and lymphoma, evaluating the expression of this marker is of paramount importance. Therefore, our goal in this study was to investigate the prognostic importance of CD5 expression in B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We evaluate CD5 expression in normal and leukemic B-cells by identifying relevant literature through a PubMed search (1998-2018) of English language papers using the terms: 'CD5,' 'B-cell,' 'Leukemia,' and 'Lymphoma.' We are doing this thorough comparison of results from CD5 positive and negative cases to make a correct decision about prognostic importance of CD5 expression in these malignancies. In a number of B-cell malignancies, CD5 is expressed in varying degrees. Due to the different origins and characteristics of these malignancies, the results of CD5 expression evaluations are heterogeneous and impossible to generalize. However, CD5 expression is sometimes associated with clinicopathologic findings, more invasive clinical course, and even resistance to treatment (specifically in DLBCL) among CD5- positive patients, which appears to be a function of CD5 signaling and its downstream factors such as STAT3. Depending on the type of malignancy, CD5 expression is associated with good or bad prognosis, which can be used as an auxiliary prognostic factor to assess the clinical course of B-cell malignancies. Moreover, the difference in expression levels of CD5 in a variety of B-cell malignancies allows for differential diagnosis of these malignancies, which can be helpful when diagnosis is difficult.",,PMC6478005,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD5', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'prognosis']",,,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JOSD1 has been recognized as a deubiquitinase, but its biological functions remain largely unknown, especially in the context of cancer. Here we established a chemoresistant xenograft model and acquired chemoresistant cell lines to mimic the establishment of acquired chemoresistance. We identified that JOSD1 is the most upregulated DUB during the development of chemoresistance. JOSD1 depletion led to severe apoptosis in gynaecological cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that JOSD1 deubiquitinated and stabilized MCL1 to suppress mitochondrial apoptotic signalling. JOSD1 overexpression caused chemoresistance in gynaecological cancer by upregulating the MCL1 protein. Importantly, high JOSD1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis among ovarian cancer patients, and serum JOSD1 levels could be a marker for clinical diagnosis. Our study showed that JOSD1 is a novel and critical oncogene that contributes to the acquisition of chemoresistance by inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic signalling via MCL1 stabilization. We also suggest that JOSD1 is an ideal therapeutic target and a promising diagnostic marker.",,PMC7206032,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-033X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic T cells express several adhesion receptors of the beta1 integrin subfamily with which they interact with ECM. However, the role of beta1 integrins in chemoresistance of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is still ill defined. In this study, we demonstrate that interactions of human T-ALL cell lines and primary blasts with three-dimensional matrices including Matrigel and collagen type I gel promote their resistance to doxorubicin via beta1 integrin. The blockade of beta1 integrin with a specific neutralizing antibody sensitized xenografted CEM leukemic cells to doxorubicin, diminished the leukemic burden in the bone marrow and resulted in the extension of animal survival. Mechanistically, Matrigel/beta1 integrin interaction enhanced T-ALL chemoresistance by promoting doxorubicin efflux through the activation of the ABCC1 drug transporter. Finally, our findings showed that Matrigel/beta1 interaction enhanced doxorubicin efflux and chemoresistance by activating the FAK-related proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) as both PYK2 inhibitor and siRNA diminished the effect of Matrigel. Collectively, these results support the role of beta1 integrin in T-ALL chemoresistance and suggest that the beta1 integrin pathway can constitute a therapeutic target to avoid chemoresistance and relapsed-disease in human T-ALL.",['MOP-136819/CIHR/Canada'],PMC6494825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Jul 15.,"The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has been causing epidemic outbreaks on a global scale. Virus infection can result in severe disease in humans, including microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Here, we characterized monoclonal antibodies isolated from a patient with an active Zika virus infection that potently neutralized virus infection in Vero cells at the nanogram-per-milliliter range. In addition, these antibodies enhanced internalization of virions into human leukemia K562 cells in vitro, indicating their possible ability to cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. Escape variants of the ZIKV MR766 strain to a potently neutralizing antibody, AC10, exhibited an amino acid substitution at residue S368 in the lateral ridge region of the envelope protein. Analysis of publicly availably ZIKV sequences revealed the S368 site to be conserved among the vast majority (97.6%) of circulating strains. We validated the importance of this residue by engineering a recombinant virus with an S368R point mutation that was unable to be fully neutralized by AC10. Four out of the 12 monoclonal antibodies tested were also unable to neutralize the virus with the S368R mutation, suggesting this region to be an important immunogenic epitope during human infection. Last, a time-of-addition infection assay further validated the escape variant and showed that all monoclonal antibodies inhibited virus binding to the cell surface. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the lateral ridge region of the envelope protein is likely an immunodominant, neutralizing epitope.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global health threat causing severe disease in humans, including microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Here, we analyzed the human monoclonal antibody response to acute ZIKV infection and found that neutralizing antibodies could not elicit Fc-mediated immune effector functions but could potentiate antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. We further identified critical epitopes involved with neutralization by generating and characterizing escape variants by whole-genome sequencing. We demonstrate that the lateral ridge region, particularly the S368 amino acid site, is critical for neutralization by domain III-specific antibodies.","['R21 AI130299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI110819/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI133649/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI120998/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007280/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6600209,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Zika virus', '*antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*neutralizing antibodies', '*prM-E', '*whole-genome sequencing']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that high pre-HCT ATG area under the curve (AUC) would be associated with a low incidence of relapse, whereas high post-HCT AUC would be associated with a high incidence of relapse. We measured serum levels of ATG capable of binding to mononuclear cells (MNCs), lymphocytes, T cells, CD4 T cells, or CD33 cells. We estimated pre- and post-HCT AUCs in 152 adult recipients of myeloablative conditioning and blood stem cells. High pre-HCT AUCs of MNC- and CD33 cell-binding ATG were associated with a low incidence of relapse and high relapse-free survival (RFS). There was a trend toward an association of high post-HCT AUC of lymphocyte-binding ATG with a high incidence of relapse and low RFS. High pre-HCT AUCs were also associated with faster engraftment and had no impact on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or fatal infections. High post-HCT AUCs were associated with a low risk of GVHD, seemed associated with an increased risk of fatal infections, and had no impact on engraftment. In conclusion, pre-HCT AUC seems to have a positive, whereas post-HCT AUC seems to have a negative, impact on relapse.",,PMC6517658,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0585-1264', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2137-9307', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0301-5139']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 17.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have demonstrated impressive initial response rates in hematologic malignancies. However, relapse rates are significant, and robust efficacies in other indications, such as solid tumors, will likely require novel therapeutic strategies and CAR designs. To that end, we sought to develop simple, highly selective targeting domains (D domains) that could be incorporated into complex, multifunctional therapeutics. Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of D domains specific for CD123, a therapeutic target for hematologic malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). CARs comprised of these D domains mediate potent T cell activation and cytolysis of CD123-expressing target cells and induce complete durable remission in two AML xenograft models. We describe a strategy of engineering less immunogenic D domains through the identification and removal of putative T cell epitopes and investigate the binding kinetics and affinity requirements of the resultant D domain CARs. Finally, we extended the utility of D domains by generating functional, bi-specific CARs comprised of a CD123-specific D domain and a CD19-specific scFv. The properties of D domains suggest that this class of targeting domain may facilitate the development of multi-functional CARs where conventional, scFv-based designs may be suboptimal.",,PMC6612629,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cell', '*CD123', '*D domain', '*acute myelogenous leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor']",,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate the cellular and molecular effects of NT157 and OSI-906 in ALL cells. NT157 and OSI-906 treatment reduced viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression in ALL cell lines. Similarly, in primary samples of patients with ALL, both OSI-906 and NT157 reduced viability, but only NT157 induced apoptosis. NT157 and OSI-906 did not show cytotoxicity in primary samples from healthy donor. NT157 and OSI-906 significantly decreased Jurkat cell migration, but did not modulate Namalwa migration. Consistent with the more potent effect of NT157 on cells, NT157 significantly modulated expression of 25 genes related to the MAPK signaling pathway in Jurkat cells, including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Both compounds inhibited mTOR and p70S6K activity, but only NT157 inhibited AKT and 4-EBP1 activation. In summary, in ALL cells, NT157 has cytotoxic activity, whereas OSI-906 is cytostatic.

Epub 2015 Nov 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary thyroid lymphoma is a rare neoplasm accounting for 1% to 5% of thyroid malignancies. We study the efficacy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in diagnosing thyroid lymphoma. METHODS: Pathology databases from our three institutions were searched for thyroid FNA biopsies having a diagnosis of lymphoma or atypical lymphoproliferative cells, or a corresponding tissue diagnosis of thyroid lymphoma having a prior FNA biopsy. RESULTS: Sixty-eight cases were retrieved from 64 patients; 67 cases with histologic confirmation. Forty-six specimens were from women (68%), ages 21 to 87 years (mean = 60). Forty-seven aspirates were diagnosed as lymphoma (n = 29) or suspicious (n = 18) for lymphoma (sensitivity = 73%), 11 atypical, 7 benign, 2 unsatisfactory, and 1 suspicious for carcinoma. Follow-up surgical diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 43), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (5), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (5), and other cases (11). Only 12 of 64 patients (13 specimens) had a known diagnosis of lymphoma prior to FNA. Light chain restriction was detected in 34 specimens (by flow cytometry [FCM] in 32 cases or polymerase chain reaction, in 2 cases). FCM was polyclonal (n = 7) or inconclusive (2) with 25 cases not having FCM performed or not having enough viable cells for evaluation. Four cases showed lymphocytic thyroiditis on surgical follow-up with 2 of these cases having a small monoclonal lymphoid population detected by FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common lymphoma in this series (63%). The sensitivity of FNA with the optional use of FCM was 71% with a specificity of 99%.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'Flow cytometry', 'Lymphocytic thyroiditis', 'MALT lymphoma', 'Thyroid lymphoma']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society of Cytopathology.

CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of ATLL outside of endemic areas can be difficult, requiring a high index of clinical suspicion with careful evaluation of the patient's clinical history.

Epub 2019 Apr 30.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the leading cause of blindness in adults with diabetes mellitus. Numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to modulate the pathogenesis of DR. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential roles of miR-455-5p in high glucose (HG)-treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and underlying mechanisms. Our present investigation discovered that the expression of miR-455-5p was apparently downregulated in ARPE-19 cells stimulated with HG. In addition, forced expression of miR-455-5p markedly enhanced cell viability and restrained HG-induced apoptosis accompanied by decreased BCL2-associated X protein (Bax)/B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) ratio and expression of apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 during HG challenged. Subsequently, augmentation of miR-455-5p remarkably alleviated HG-triggered oxidative stress injury as reflected by decreased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content as well as NADPH oxidase 4 expression, concomitant with enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and GPX stimulated with HG. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-455-5p effectively ameliorated HG-stimulated inflammatory response as exemplified by repressing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in ARPE-19 cells challenged by HG. Most importantly, we successfully identified suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) as a direct target gene of miR-455-5p, and miR-455-5p negatively regulated the expression of SOCS3. Mechanistically, restoration of SOCS3 abrogated the beneficial effects of miR-455-5p on apoptosis, accumulation of ROS, and inflammatory factors production in response to HG. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that miR-455-5p relieved HG-induced damage through repressing apoptosis, oxidant stress, and inflammatory response by targeting SOCS3. The study gives evidence that miR-455-5p may serve as a new potential therapeutic agent for DR treatment.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MiR-455-5p', '*SOCS3', '*apoptosis', '*diabetic retinopathy', '*inflammatory response', '*oxidative stress']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5474-3577'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of CSF3R mutations in patients with CEBPA(dm) was 19.80% (20/101). Patients with CSF3R mutations were associated with a lower platelet (u = 2.728, P = 0.006) and higher leukocytes (u = 3.178, P = 0.001) compared with those with wide-type CSF3R gene. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 18.7% in patients with CSF3R mutations, which was significantly lower than those with wide-type CSF3R (31.8%) (P = 0.015). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was also significantly different between patients with and without CSF3R mutations (17.5% versus 57.4%, P = 0.019). The prevalence of CSF3R mutations was high in AML patients with CEBPA(dm), which indicated a poor prognosis, and CSF3R mutations may be a new potential candidate for prognostically re-stratifying AML patients with CEBPA(dm).",['LCFYJJ2017005/Clinical Research Foundation of First Hospital of Jilin University'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA double mutations', 'CSF3R mutations', 'Chinese population', 'Prognoses']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1090-5802'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a key enzyme in the detoxification of 5AC. We investigated whether the CDA expression could predict response to 5AC in MDS. Among leukemia-derived cell lines, MDS-L, an MDS-derived cell line with a relatively low CDA expression level, was found to be the most sensitive to 5AC. Combination with tetrahydrouridine, an inhibitor of CDA, synergistically potentiated the cytotoxic effect of 5AC. Treatment with 5AC markedly enhanced the expression level of CDA mRNA and showed demethylation at CpG sites in the 5'-flanking region of the CDA gene. We further compared the protein expression levels of CDA in matched clinical samples before and after treatment with 5AC in bone marrow cells from 8 MDS patients by an immunohistochemical analysis. The CDA expression level showed an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 5AC treatment in 3 of these cases, and these three patients with relatively higher CDA expression levels after 5AC treatment all showed better clinical responses to 5AC. In contrast, the 5 remaining patients, whose CDA expression showed no augmentation, observed no clinical benefit. Taken together, the optimized determination of the CDA expression levels before and after 5AC treatment, and the methylation status at CpG sites of 5'-flanking region of the CDA gene, may contribute to the development of precise 5AC therapy for MDS.",,PMC6481348,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'DNA methylation', 'cytidine deaminase', 'hypomethylating agent', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in SRSF2 gene are frequently reported in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is imperative to understand how these mutations affect SRSF2-mediated splicing and cause MDS. In this study, we characterized MDS-associated SRSF2 mutants (P95H, P95L, and P95R). We found that those mutants and wild-type SRSF2 proteins showed nuclear localization in HeLa cells. In vitro splicing reaction also revealed that mutant proteins associated with both precursor and spliced mRNAs, suggesting that the mutants directly participate in splicing. We established the human myeloid leukemia K562 cell lines that stably expressed myc-tagged wild-type or mutant SRSF2 proteins, and then performed RNA-sequence to analyze the splicing pattern of each cell line. The results revealed that both wild-type and mutants affected splicing of approximately 3,000 genes. Although splice site sequences adjacent to the affected exons showed no significant difference compared to the total exons, exonic motif analyses with both inclusion- and exclusion-enhanced exons demonstrated that wild-type and mutants have different binding sequences in exons. These results indicate that mutations of SRSF2 in MDS change binding properties of SRSF2 to exonic motifs and this causes aberrant splicing.",,PMC6476956,,['NOTNLM'],"['EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2)', 'SRSF2', 'aberrant splicing', 'exonic splicing enhancer', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'splicing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Procedure: We prospectively collected clinical data on incidence, diagnostic procedures, management and outcome of IFD in children treated for hematological malignancies or undergoing HSCT in three major European pediatric cancer centers. Results: A total of 304 children (median age 6.0 years) who underwent 360 therapies (211 chemotherapy treatments, 138 allogeneic HSCTs and/or 11 investigational chemotherapeutic treatments) were included in the analysis. Nineteen children developed proven/probable IFD, mostly due to Aspergillus (n = 10) and Candida spp. (n = 5), respectively. In patients receiving chemotherapy, 11 IFDs occurred, all during induction or re-induction therapy. None of these patients died due to IFD, whereas IFD was lethal in 3 of the 8 HSCT recipients with IFD. Significant differences among centers were observed with regard to the use of imaging diagnostics and the choice, initiation and duration of antifungal prophylaxis.

Several target drug delivery systems (DDSs) including nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed as an important strategy to deliver classical medicine. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the application of novel daunorubicin (DNR)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly-l-lysine-polyethylene glycol-transferrin (Tf) nanoparticles (DNR-loaded NPs) in hematologic malignancies in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: DNR-loaded NPs were prepared by the modified double-emulsion solvent evaporation/diffusion method, and its microscopic form was observed under scanning electron microscope. Intracellular distribution of DNR was directly detected by fluorescence microscopy. After establishment of a tumor xenograft model by injecting K562 cells into the left leg of nude mice, the therapeutic effect of the DNR-loaded NPs on the growth of tumors was measured by calculating the tumor size, and the relative expression of Caspase-3 protein was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, intracellular concentration of DNR and the extent of cell apoptosis in primary leukemia cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Results: DNR-loaded NPs had a spherical shape of about 180 nm in diameter. DNR-loaded NP group showed a significant enhancement of cellular uptake in K562 cells compared with DNR group. Tumor inhibition rate was higher in DNR-loaded NP group in comparison with DNR group, and the relative expression of Caspase-3 protein was upregulated in DNR-loaded NP group compared with DNR group. Furthermore, DNR-loaded NPs obviously increased intracellular concentration of DNR in primary leukemia cells compared with DNR group, but there was no significant difference in primary cell apoptosis between the two groups.

In this study, we report novel functions of CBFA2T3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. CBFA2T3 regulates cell-fate genes to establish gene expression signatures associated with leukemia stem cell (LSC) transformation and relapse. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that CBFA2T3 expression marks LSC signatures in primary AML samples. Analysis of paired primary and relapsed samples showed that acquisition of LSC gene signatures involves cell type-specific activation of CBFA2T3 transcription via the NM_005187 promoter by GCN5. Short hairpin RNA-mediated downregulation of CBFA2T3 arrests G1/S cell cycle progression, diminishes LSC gene signatures, and attenuates in vitro and in vivo proliferation of AML cells. We also found that the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein transcriptionally represses NM_005187 to confer t(8;21) AML patients a natural resistance to relapse, whereas lacking a similar repression mechanism renders non-core-binding factor AML patients highly susceptible to relapse. These studies show that 2 related primary AML-associated factors, the expression level of CBFA2T3 and the ability of leukemia cells to repress cell type-specific CBFA2T3 gene transcription, play important roles in patient prognosis, providing a paradigm that differential abilities to repress hematopoietic coregulator gene transcription are correlated with patient-specific outcomes in AML.","['R01 HL093195/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA178513/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008306/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6517668,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7966-7005', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2409-3999', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5875-1534', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8798-7316']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 27.,"Attaining complete remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) correlates with better post-transplant outcomes. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), an anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, has shown significantly higher rates of remission, minimal residual disease negativity, and HSCT versus standard chemotherapy in treating relapsed/refractory (R/R) ALL. We investigated the role of previous transplant and proceeding directly to HSCT after remission as factors in determining post-transplant survival in the setting of InO treatment for R/R ALL. The analyzed population comprised InO-treated patients who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT in 2 clinical trials (phase 1/2: NCT01363297 and phase 3: NCT01564784). Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from HSCT to death (any cause). Of 236 InO-treated patients, 101 (43%) proceeded to allogeneic HSCT and were included in this analysis. Most received InO as first salvage (62%); 85% had no previous HSCT. Median (95% confidence interval [CI]) post-transplant OS was 9.2 months (5.1, not evaluable) with 2-year survival probability (95% CI) of 41% (32% to 51%). In first-HSCT patients (n=86), median (95% CI) post-transplant OS was 11.8 months (5.9, not evaluable) with 2-year survival probability (95% CI) of 46% (35% to 56%); some patients relapsed and needed additional treatment before HSCT (n=28). Those who went directly to first HSCT upon remission with no additional salvage/induction treatment (n=73) fared best: median post-transplant OS was not reached with a 2-year survival probability (95% CI) of 51% (39% to 62%). In patients with R/R ALL, InO followed by allogeneic HSCT provided an optimal long-term survival benefit among those with no previous HSCT who went directly to transplant after remission.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic transplantation', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*Relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Apr 27.,"Hemoglobinopathies, such as beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (SCD) are caused by abnormal structure or reduced production of beta-chains and affect millions of people worldwide. Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is a condition which is naturally occurring and characterized by a considerable elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adult red blood cells. Individuals with compound heterozygous beta-thalassemia or SCD and HPFH have milder clinical symptoms. So, HbF reactivation has long been sought as an approach to mitigate the clinical symptoms of beta-thalassemia and SCD. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing strategy, we deleted a 200bp genomic region within the human erythroid-specific BCL11A (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A) enhancer in KU-812, KG-1, and K562cell lines. In our study, deletion of 200bp of BCL11A erythroid enhancer including GATAA motif leads to strong induction of gamma-hemoglobin expression in K562cells, but not in KU-812 and KG-1cells. Altogether, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 as a precision genome editing tool for treating beta-thalassemia. In addition, our data indicate that KU-812 and KG-1cell lines are not good models for studying HbF reactivation through inactivation of BCL11A silencing pathway.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11A', 'Beta-thalassemia', 'CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tool', 'Fetal hemoglobin', 'K562cell line', 'gamma-globin']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Apr 30.,"BACKGROUND: Data on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) prevalence are scarce. Here we provide an estimation of the prevalence of CML in France for the year 2014 using French national health insurance data. METHODS: We selected patients claiming reimbursement for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or with hospital discharge diagnoses for CML, BCR/ABL-positive or with full reimbursement of health care expenses for myeloid leukemia. We built an algorithm which we validated on a random sample of 100 potential CML patients by comparing the results obtained using the algorithm and the opinion of two hematologists who reviewed the patient demographics and sequence of care abstracted from claims data (internal validity). For external validity, we compared the number of incident CML patients identified using the algorithm with those recorded in French population-based cancer registries in departments covered by such a registry. RESULTS: We identified 10 789 prevalent CML patients in 2014, corresponding to a crude prevalence rate of 16.3 per 100 000 inhabitants [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.0-16.6]: 18.5 in men [18.0-19.0] and 14.2 in women [13.8-14.6]. The crude CML prevalence was less than 1.6 per 100 000 [1.2-2.0] under age 20, increasing to a maximum of 48.2 [45.4-51.2) at ages 75-79. It varied from 10.2 to 23.8 per 100 000 across French departments. The algorithm showed high internal and external validity. Concordance rate between the algorithm and the hematologists was 96%, and the numbers of incident CML patients identified using the algorithm and the registries were 162 and 150, respectively. CONCLUSION: We built and validated an algorithm to identify CML patients in administrative healthcare databases. In addition to prevalence estimation, the algorithm could be used for future economic evaluations or pharmaco-epidemiological studies in this population.",,PMC6558491,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer registries', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*epidemiology', '*insurance claims database', '*prevalence']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0213-0736', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0455-6749']",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We also investigate the association of 12p chromosomal on the expression of HOTAIR, miRNA-193a, and c-kit gene as targeting genes for HOTAIR in AML. METHODS: AML patients with 12p chromosomal abnormalities were recruited and compared to AML with other chromosomal abnormalities rather than 12p. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ""HOTAIR,"" miR-193a, and c-Kit genes expression were measured in bone marrow samples using Syber green based real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found a significant difference for the expression levels of HOTAIR, c-kit, and miR-193a between 12p abnormalities associated AML and those without. The survival analysis revealed that patient's with low expression levels of HOTAIR and c-kit had significantly better survival and leukemia free survival. In contrast, miR-193a was associated with better overall survival but not leukemia free survival. CONCLUSION: 12p abnormalities associated AML were associated with worse prognosis. Our results proved that HOTAIR, miR-193a, and c-kit genes are independent prognostic predictors in 12p chromosomal associated AML; therefore it may represent a novel therapeutic application in AML in the future.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*12p aberrations', '*12p deletion', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*c-KIT', '*homeobox transcript antisense RNA', '*miR-193a']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6646-4674'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To design and synthesize novel 1-(4-flourophenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives as bioisosters of roscovitine with potential cytotoxic and CDK2 inhibitory activity. METHODS: A series of novel 1-(4-flourophenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines were designed and synthesized. Structural elucidation for all the newly synthesized compounds was achieved through performing MS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and IR spectral techniques. Eight compounds were screened for their cytotoxic activity by National Cancer Institute (USA) against 60 different human cancer cell lines. Compounds 2a, 4, 6, 7b, 8a and 8b were further studied through the determination of their IC50 values against the most sensitive cell lines. The inhibitory activities of compounds 2a and 4 were evaluated against CDK2 enzyme. RESULTS: Compound 4 exhibited the most prominent broad-spectrum cytotoxic activity against 42 cell lines representing all human cancer types showing growth inhibition percentages from 53.19 to 99.39. Compound 2a showed promising selectivity against several cell lines. Moreover, all the test compounds exhibited potent cytotoxic activity in nanomolar to micromolar range with IC50 values ranging from 0.58 to 8.32muM. Compound 2a showed significant cytotoxic activity against CNS (SNB-75), lung (NCI-H460) and ovarian (OVCAR-4) cancer cell lines with IC50 values 0.64, 0.78 and 1.9muM, respectively. Compound 4 showed promising potency against leukemia (HL-60) and CNS (SNB-75) cell lines (IC50 = 0.58 and 0.94muM, sequentially). Moreover, the antiproliferative activities of compounds 2a and 4 appeared to correlate well with their ability to inhibit CDK2 at sub-micromolar level (IC50 = 0.69 and 0.67muM, respectively) that were comparable to roscovitine (IC50=0.44muM). The Molecular docking results revealed that compound 4 interacted with the same key amino acids as roscovitine in the active site of CDK2 enzyme with a marked docking score (-14.1031 kcal/mol).

METHODS: RQ-PCR method was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 53 AML patients with AML1/ETO(+), ELISA was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 protein in peripheral blood, and the correlations of galectin-3 expression with clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of galectin-3 were significantly higher in newly diagnosed AML1/ETO(+) AML patients compared with the control ( P<0.001). Galectin-3 mRNA and protein expressions were positively correlated (r=0.732, P<0.001). Galectin-3 protein was significantly decreased during the period of complete remission (CR)( P<0.001). The mRNA expression of galectin-3 was negatively correlated with the count of white blood cells ( P=0.014), and positively correlated with CD34 expression and additional cytogenetic aberrations (ACA) ( P=0.001, P=0.026). There was no significant difference in CR, partial remission (PR), induction death (early mortality) between galectin-3 high-expression group and low-expression group ( P>0.05), but there was significant difference in recurrence rate between the two groups ( P=0.029). The median overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate were shortened in the high-expression group ( P=0.007, P=0.015) and the cumulative incidence of relapse was increased ( P=0.045), but there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of CM(155mm]mortality ( P>0.05).

Epub 2019 Apr 29.,"Cementum regeneration is an important and challenging stage in periodontal tissue engineering and regeneration. Pathosis of the periodontium, including cementum, is important in precision diagnosis and obstinate treatment of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, leukemia, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Here, we found that during periodontium development, transcription factor 7-like 2 (Tcf7l2) was widely expressed in the periodontium and dental sac. In mouse cementoblast cell line (OCCM-30), the activation of NF-kappaB and cementoblast mineralization was significantly reduced when Tcf7l2 gene was silenced. Moreover, Tcf7l2 has a positive effect on NF-kappaB and cementoblast mineralization. Therefore, Tcf7l2 promotes cementum formation through the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, we found a decreased expression of phosphorylated p65 and a thin layer of cementum in Tcf7l2(fl/fl) mice. These results suggest that Tcf7l2, which accelerates cementum formation by activating NF-kappaB, has great potential in the treatment of periodontitis and provide guidance for periodontal tissue regeneration.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NF-kappaB signal pathway', '*Tcf7l2', '*cementoblast', '*dental cementum', '*signal transduction']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4223-9522'],"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Apr 30.,"Survivin is one of the major members of Inhibitory Apoptotic Proteins (IAP) family. The functional anti-apoptotic and regulatory role of Survivin in the cell cycle had made it as an interesting candidate for tumor studies. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is one of the most common malignancies of children that accounts for 30% of all the childhood malignancies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic importance of Survivin level in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients of Iran in four different steps of disease in order to follow up its impact on various treatment ways, the development of the disease, and the response to treatment in the patients. The expression level of Survivin was evaluated in 85 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 85 healthy controls using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Also, western blot analysis was done to confirm the results. Based on our findings, the expression of Survivin showed a significant up-regulation in patients compared to controls. Therefore, a correlation between Survivin expression and the development pattern of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a strong diagnostic efficiency (AUC-ROC, 0.8562) was observed. Therefore, it can be introduced as a potential marker for prognosis B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the future.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptotic proteins', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction', 'Survivin']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9170-9343', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4555-634X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5351-3577', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5553-0768', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5763-5064']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most frequent adult leukaemia in the Western world. In this study, we have evaluated basal CIN in untreated patients with CLL by measuring chromosome aberrations (CAs) and micronucleus (MN) frequency and their association with different prognostic factors. Seventy-two patients and 21 normal controls were analysed. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies were performed. IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region) mutational status was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. An increased number of CA in patients compared with controls (P = 0.0001) was observed. Cases with abnormal karyotypes showed increased CA rate than those with normal karyotypes (P = 0.0026), with a particularly highest frequency in cases with complex karyotypes. Among FISH risk groups, a significant low frequency of CA was found in patients with no FISH alterations compared to those with del13q14 and >/=2 FISH alterations (P = 0.0074). When mean CA value (6.7%) was considered, significant differences in the distribution of low and high CA frequency between cases with normal and abnormal karyotypes (P = 0.002) were observed. By MN analysis, higher frequency in patients compared to controls (P = 0.0001) was also found, as well as between cases with >/=2 FISH abnormalities and those with no FISH alterations (P = 0.026). Similarly, significant differences were observed when patients were divided according to mean MN frequency (2.2%; P </= 0.04). Interestingly, patients with high MN frequency had shorter time to first treatment than those with low frequency (P = 0.024). Cases with mutated and unmutated IGHV status showed increased CA and MN frequencies compared to controls (P </= 0.0007), but no differences between both groups were found. Our results support the strong interaction between CIN and genomic complexity as well as their influence on poor outcome in this pathology.",,,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.
