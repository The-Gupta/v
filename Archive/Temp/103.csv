Rat pancreatic acinar cells are known to transdifferentiate into functional beta cells, with recapitulation of several pancreas developmental features. Considering the inhibitory functions of hedgehog signalling in early and mid-stage pancreatic development, we questioned whether it also operates in transdifferentiating acinar cells and whether its modulation would influence postnatal beta cell neogenesis in vitro. METHODS: Rat exocrine cells were precultured in suspension for 4 days and then incubated with EGF and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 72 h. The hedgehog signalling pathway was modulated during this, and its effects analysed by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and western blot. RESULTS: Our data indicate induction of Dhh and Ihh, but not Shh, expression during acinar cell culture, resulting in activation of hedgehog targets (Ptc1, Gli1). Exposure of the metaplastic cells to EGF and LIF induced beta cell differentiation without affecting endogenous hedgehog activity. Whereas blocking endogenous hedgehog only slightly increased beta cell neogenesis, exposure to embryoid body-conditioned medium activated hedgehog signalling as well as other pathways such as Notch, resulting in severe blockade of beta cell neogenesis. Interestingly, this effect was partially rescued by treatment with the hedgehog inhibitor, 3-keto-N-(aminoethyl-aminocaproyl-dihydrocinnamoyl)-cyclopamine (KAAD-cyclopamine), alone. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We report here Dhh/Ihh-dependent activation of hedgehog targets during pancreatic exocrine cell metaplasia in vitro and a persistent inhibitory function of hedgehog signalling in a model of postnatal beta cell differentiation.","['Mfopou, J K', 'Baeyens, L', 'Bouwens, L']","['Mfopou JK', 'Baeyens L', 'Bouwens L']","['Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120112,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (Dhh protein, rat)', '0 (Gli1 protein, rat)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Ihh protein, rat)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Patched Receptors)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)', '0 (Ptch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ptch1 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Shh protein, rat)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Acinar Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pancreas, Exocrine/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Patched Receptors', 'Patched-1 Receptor', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00125-011-2434-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2012 Apr;55(4):1024-34. doi: 10.1007/s00125-011-2434-8.

To further study the role of PRC2 in T-ALL, we used NOTCH1-dependent mouse models of the disease, as well as human T-ALL samples, and combined locus-specific and global analysis of NOTCH1-driven epigenetic changes. These studies demonstrated that activation of NOTCH1 specifically induces loss of the repressive mark Lys27 trimethylation of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by antagonizing the activity of PRC2. These studies suggest a tumor suppressor role for PRC2 in human leukemia and suggest a hitherto unrecognized dynamic interplay between oncogenic NOTCH1 and PRC2 function for the regulation of gene expression and cell transformation.","['Ntziachristos, Panagiotis', 'Tsirigos, Aristotelis', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Nedjic, Jelena', 'Trimarchi, Thomas', 'Flaherty, Maria Sol', 'Ferres-Marco, Dolors', 'da Ros, Vanina', 'Tang, Zuojian', 'Siegle, Jasmin', 'Asp, Patrik', 'Hadler, Michael', 'Rigo, Isaura', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Patel, Jay', 'Huynh, Tien', 'Utro, Filippo', 'Poglio, Sandrine', 'Samon, Jeremy B', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Brown, Stuart', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Dominguez, Maria', 'Ferrando, Adolfo', 'Aifantis, Iannis']","['Ntziachristos P', 'Tsirigos A', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Nedjic J', 'Trimarchi T', 'Flaherty MS', 'Ferres-Marco D', 'da Ros V', 'Tang Z', 'Siegle J', 'Asp P', 'Hadler M', 'Rigo I', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Patel J', 'Huynh T', 'Utro F', 'Poglio S', 'Samon JB', 'Paietta E', 'Racevskis J', 'Rowe JM', 'Rabadan R', 'Levine RL', 'Brown S', 'Pflumio F', 'Dominguez M', 'Ferrando A', 'Aifantis I']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120206,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Suz12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/03/30 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2651 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2651 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Med. 2012 Feb 6;18(2):298-301. doi: 10.1038/nm.2651.,"['R01 CA105129-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-AI057158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA16087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141399-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 AI057158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA155743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA16087-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01LM010140-01/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM010140/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3274628,"['GEO/GSE34554', 'GEO/GSE34954']",['NIHMS345806'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, IL7R, JAK3, JAK1, SH2B3 and BRAF), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; GATA3, ETV6, RUNX1, IKZF1 and EP300) and histone-modifying genes (48%; EZH2, EED, SUZ12, SETD2 and EP300). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including DNM2, ECT2L and RELN. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL.","['Zhang, Jinghui', 'Ding, Li', 'Holmfeldt, Linda', 'Wu, Gang', 'Heatley, Sue L', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Easton, John', 'Chen, Xiang', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Rusch, Michael', 'Lu, Charles', 'Chen, Shann-Ching', 'Wei, Lei', 'Collins-Underwood, J Racquel', 'Ma, Jing', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Ulyanov, Anatoly', 'Becksfort, Jared', 'Gupta, Pankaj', 'Huether, Robert', 'Kriwacki, Richard W', 'Parker, Matthew', 'McGoldrick, Daniel J', 'Zhao, David', 'Alford, Daniel', 'Espy, Stephen', 'Bobba, Kiran Chand', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Roberts, Stefan', 'Barbato, Michael I', 'Campana, Dario', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Kleppe, Maria', 'Cools, Jan', 'Shimano, Kristin A', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Doulatov, Sergei', 'Eppert, Kolja', 'Laurenti, Elisa', 'Notta, Faiyaz', 'Dick, John E', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Wood, Brent', 'Winter, Stuart', 'Dunsmore, Kimberley P', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Fulton, Lucinda L', 'Hong, Xin', 'Harris, Christopher C', 'Dooling, David J', 'Ochoa, Kerri', 'Johnson, Kimberly J', 'Obenauer, John C', 'Evans, William E', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Naeve, Clayton W', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Downing, James R', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Zhang J', 'Ding L', 'Holmfeldt L', 'Wu G', 'Heatley SL', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Easton J', 'Chen X', 'Wang J', 'Rusch M', 'Lu C', 'Chen SC', 'Wei L', 'Collins-Underwood JR', 'Ma J', 'Roberts KG', 'Pounds SB', 'Ulyanov A', 'Becksfort J', 'Gupta P', 'Huether R', 'Kriwacki RW', 'Parker M', 'McGoldrick DJ', 'Zhao D', 'Alford D', 'Espy S', 'Bobba KC', 'Song G', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Roberts S', 'Barbato MI', 'Campana D', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Raimondi SC', 'Kleppe M', 'Cools J', 'Shimano KA', 'Hermiston ML', 'Doulatov S', 'Eppert K', 'Laurenti E', 'Notta F', 'Dick JE', 'Basso G', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Devidas M', 'Wood B', 'Winter S', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Fulton RS', 'Fulton LL', 'Hong X', 'Harris CC', 'Dooling DJ', 'Ochoa K', 'Johnson KJ', 'Obenauer JC', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH', 'Naeve CW', 'Ley TJ', 'Mardis ER', 'Wilson RK', 'Downing JR', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120111,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Reelin Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (RELN protein, human)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Child', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics', 'Reelin Protein', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10725 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10725 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 Jan 11;481(7380):157-63. doi: 10.1038/nature10725.,"['CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3267575,"['GENBANK/JF736506', 'GEO/GSE28703', 'GEO/GSE33315']",['NIHMS348037'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promise in the treatment of carcinomas and are currently under intense research. To make better use of HDACi in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), HDAC isoenzyme levels were studied. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for HDAC isoenzyme was measured in 32 patients with CLL and compared with 17 normal volunteer controls. ZAP-70, CD38 and CD44 were also assayed and correlated to HDAC isoenzyme levels. RESULTS: The results showed: (1) HDAC isoenzyme levels in CLL were significantly increased in class I including HDAC1 and HDAC3, in class II including HADC6, HDAC7, HDAC9 and HDAC10, and in class III including SIRT1 and SIRT6; (2) higher expression of HDAC isoenzyme levels was found in ZAP-70+ compared to ZAP-70- patients, and CD44 expression levels were correlated with HDAC isoenzyme expression levels in the majority of HDAC classes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest: (1) in CLL, elevated HDAC isoenzyme activity is not restricted to one class, and therefore, HDACi therapy may need to be directed to more than one specific class of HDAC; (2) higher HDAC expression activity may indicate a poor prognosis and more advanced disease stage (through indirect evidence), since higher values were found in patients with ZAP-70+ and higher CD44 expression levels.","['Wang, J C', 'Kafeel, M I', 'Avezbakiyev, B', 'Chen, C', 'Sun, Y', 'Rathnasabapathy, C', 'Kalavar, M', 'He, Z', 'Burton, J', 'Lichter, S']","['Wang JC', 'Kafeel MI', 'Avezbakiyev B', 'Chen C', 'Sun Y', 'Rathnasabapathy C', 'Kalavar M', 'He Z', 'Burton J', 'Lichter S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11212, USA. jcwang5@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120110,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/06/28 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000334577 [pii]', '10.1159/000334577 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2011;81(5-6):325-9. doi: 10.1159/000334577.

To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.","['Ding, Li', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Larson, David E', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Koboldt, Daniel C', 'Welch, John S', 'Ritchey, Julie K', 'Young, Margaret A', 'Lamprecht, Tamara', 'McLellan, Michael D', 'McMichael, Joshua F', 'Wallis, John W', 'Lu, Charles', 'Shen, Dong', 'Harris, Christopher C', 'Dooling, David J', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Fulton, Lucinda L', 'Chen, Ken', 'Schmidt, Heather', 'Kalicki-Veizer, Joelle', 'Magrini, Vincent J', 'Cook, Lisa', 'McGrath, Sean D', 'Vickery, Tammi L', 'Wendl, Michael C', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Watson, Mark A', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'Shannon, William D', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Kulkarni, Shashikant', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Ding L', 'Ley TJ', 'Larson DE', 'Miller CA', 'Koboldt DC', 'Welch JS', 'Ritchey JK', 'Young MA', 'Lamprecht T', 'McLellan MD', 'McMichael JF', 'Wallis JW', 'Lu C', 'Shen D', 'Harris CC', 'Dooling DJ', 'Fulton RS', 'Fulton LL', 'Chen K', 'Schmidt H', 'Kalicki-Veizer J', 'Magrini VJ', 'Cook L', 'McGrath SD', 'Vickery TL', 'Wendl MC', 'Heath S', 'Watson MA', 'Link DC', 'Tomasson MH', 'Shannon WD', 'Payton JE', 'Kulkarni S', 'Westervelt P', 'Walter MJ', 'Graubert TA', 'Mardis ER', 'Wilson RK', 'DiPersio JF']","['The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120111,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genome, Human/drug effects/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutagenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10738 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10738 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 Jan 11;481(7382):506-10. doi: 10.1038/nature10738.,"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079-10/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3267864,,['NIHMS341298'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 307 patients with myotonic dystrophy identified from medical records of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from January 1, l993, through May 28, 2010, was retrospectively analyzed. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of specific cancers for patients with myotonic dystrophy compared with age- and sex-specific cancer incidences of the general population. Age-dependent cumulative risks were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 53 cancers were observed at a median age at diagnosis of 55 years. Patients with myotonic dystrophy had an increased risk of thyroid cancer (SIR, 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-12.93; P=.001) and choroidal melanoma (SIR, 27.54; 95% CI, 3.34-99.49; P<.001). They may also have an increased risk of testicular cancer (SIR, 5.09; 95% CI, 0.62-18.38; P=.06) and prostate cancer (SIR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.95-4.35; P=.05). The estimated cumulative risks at age 50 years were 1.72% (95% CI, 0.64%-4.55%) for thyroid cancer and 1.00% (95% CI, 0.25%-3.92%) for choroidal melanoma. There was no statistical evidence of an increased risk of brain, breast, colorectal, lung, renal, bladder, endometrial, or ovarian cancer; lymphoma; leukemia; or multiple myeloma. CONCLUSION: Patients with myotonic dystrophy may have an increased risk of thyroid cancer and choroidal melanoma and, possibly, testicular and prostate cancers.","['Win, Aung Ko', 'Perattur, Promilla G', 'Pulido, Jose S', 'Pulido, Christine M', 'Lindor, Noralane M']","['Win AK', 'Perattur PG', 'Pulido JS', 'Pulido CM', 'Lindor NM']","['Centre for Molecular, Environmental, Genetic and Analytic Epidemiology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120110,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Records/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Myotonic Dystrophy/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)00028-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Feb;87(2):130-5. doi: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.09.005.

Only one case of Burkitt's lymphoma presenting with toothache, paresthesia, and Horner's syndrome has been described and no case reports of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as the etiology of Horner's syndrome currently exist in the literature. In addition, lymphoid neoplasms have rarely been reported to occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 despite an increased risk of many types of cancer in such cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old Thai man presented with a progressively enlarged left supraclavicular mass together with a significant weight loss and night sweating for four months. He also noticed hoarseness and ptosis of his left eye associated with double vision for two months. Physical examination revealed large supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis) on the left side of his face. A large mediastinal mass was clearly detected by chest X-ray and computed tomography and subsequent lymph node biopsy provided a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Interestingly, the patient was also definitely diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 from multiple cafe au lait macules, axillary freckles, three neurofibromas, multiple Lisch nodules, and a history of affected family members. He subsequently received chemotherapy with a good response. Twenty-seven cases of various types of lymphoid neoplasms previously reported to occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients were also extracted from the literature. All cases were non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the major subtype was T-cell. Only nine cases were B-cell lymphoma. The majority of cases were young with a median age at lymphoma diagnosis of 9.4 years (range 1.1 to 77 years). Two-thirds of the cases were boys or men. Other concomitant malignancies were brain tumor, colorectal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: We describe for the first time a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that occurred in a neurofibromatosis type 1 patient with Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome can be an initial manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients who present with a classical triad of Horner's syndrome should always be fully investigated for lymphomatous involvement, especially in the thorax. The exact molecular mechanism for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma development in neurofibromatosis type 1 cases remains to be elucidated.","['Lueangarun, Saoraya', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Lueangarun S', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 2 Prannok Road, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. chirayuaue@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120111,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/01/13 06:01,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-8 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Jan 11;6:8. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-8.,,PMC3314538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results also suggest that induction of p21 and subsequent disturbance of Bax/Bcl-2 balanced ratio as well as decreased telomerase activity may be rational mechanisms for the potent/direct short-term cytotoxicity of high doses of BIBR1532 against NB4 cells.","['Bashash, D', 'Ghaffari, S H', 'Zaker, F', 'Hezave, K', 'Kazerani, M', 'Ghavamzadeh, A', 'Alimoghaddam, K', 'Mosavi, S A', 'Gharehbaghian, A', 'Vossough, P']","['Bashash D', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Zaker F', 'Hezave K', 'Kazerani M', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Mosavi SA', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Vossough P']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Aminobenzoates)', '0 (BIBR 1532)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/13 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07357907.2011.629378 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2012 Jan;30(1):57-64. doi: 10.3109/07357907.2011.629378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This clinical case points out the utility of flow cytometry in the characterization of AML-M7 in a 3-year-old German Shepherd dog. Flow cytometry investigation has established megakaryocytic lineage involvement by showing the presence of two megakaryocyte/platelet associated antigens (CD9 and CD61). In human medicine CD9 may be used as a platelet and megakaryocyte marker. There is an evidence of cross-reactivity of human anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody with canine samples.

Potential association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome has attracted broad interests in this topic. Although recent studies have indicated that XMRV is unlikely a human pathogen, further understanding of XMRV xenoinfection would allow in vivo modeling of the initial steps of gammaretroviral interspecies transmission, evolution and dissemination in a new host population. In this study, we monitored the long-term consequences of XMRV infection and its possible vertical transmission in a permissive foreign host, wild-derived Mus pahari mice. One year post-infection, XMRV-infected mice showed no notable pathological changes, while proviral DNA was detected in three out of eight mice. XMRV-infected mice remained seropositive throughout the study although the levels of gp70 Env- and p30 capsid-specific antibodies gradually decreased. When vertical XMRV transmission was assessed, no viremia, humoral immune responses nor endogenization were observed in nine offspring from infected mothers, yet one offspring was found PCR-positive for XMRV-specific sequences. Amplified viral sequences from the offspring showed several mutations, including one amino acid deletion in the receptor binding domain of Env SU. Our results therefore demonstrate long-term asymptomatic infection, low incidence of vertical transmission and limited evolution of XMRV upon transspecies infection of a permissive new host, Mus pahari.","['Sakuma, Toshie', 'Tonne, Jason M', 'Malcolm, Jessica A', 'Thatava, Tayaramma', 'Ohmine, Seiga', 'Peng, Kah-Whye', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiro']","['Sakuma T', 'Tonne JM', 'Malcolm JA', 'Thatava T', 'Ohmine S', 'Peng KW', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mothers', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*transmission', 'Time Factors', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/immunology/*pathogenicity']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029682 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15883 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e29682. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029682.

Many of these CLL/SLL susceptibility loci are located in non-coding or intergenic regions, posing a significant challenge to determine their potential functional relevance. Here, we review the literature of all CLL/SLL GWAS and validation studies, and apply eQTL analysis to identify putatively functional SNPs that affect gene expression that may be causal in the pathogenesis of CLL/SLL. We tested 12 independent risk loci for their potential to alter gene expression through cis-acting mechanisms, using publicly available gene expression profiles with matching genotype information. Sixteen SNPs were identified that are linked to differential expression of SP140, a putative tumor suppressor gene previously associated with CLL/SLL. Three additional SNPs were associated with differential expression of DACT3 and GNG8, which are involved in the WNT/beta-catenin- and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, respectively, that have been previously implicated in CLL/SLL pathogenesis. Using in silico functional prediction tools, we found that 14 of the 19 significant eQTL SNPs lie in multiple putative regulatory elements, several of which have prior implications in CLL/SLL or other hematological malignancies. Although experimental validation is needed, our study shows that the use of existing GWAS data in combination with eQTL analysis and in silico methods represents a useful starting point to screen for putatively causal SNPs that may be involved in the etiology of CLL/SLL.","['Sille, Fenna C M', 'Thomas, Reuben', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Conde, Lucia', 'Skibola, Christine F']","['Sille FC', 'Thomas R', 'Smith MT', 'Conde L', 'Skibola CF']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Computational Biology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029632 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19661 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e29632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029632.

Marked differences were observed compared to pharmacokinetic parameters for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) obtained previously: in CLL, time-varying clearance at time zero (CL(2)) was faster, volumes of distribution (V(1) and V(2)) were larger, and rate of change (K(des)) from the targetmediated clearance pathway to catabolic elimination was lower than NHL. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide disposition showed no apparent change when co-administered with rituximab. A positive correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response was observed, supporting the use of the higher rituximab dose of 500 mg/m(2) in CLL patients (vs 375 mg/m(2) in NHL) to achieve an effective clinical response.","['Li, Jing', 'Zhi, Jianguo', 'Wenger, Michael', 'Valente, Nancy', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Mangat, Ranvir', 'Joshi, Amita', 'Visich, Jennifer']","['Li J', 'Zhi J', 'Wenger M', 'Valente N', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Robak T', 'Mangat R', 'Joshi A', 'Visich J']","['Clinical Pharmacology, MS 463a, Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. li.jing@gene.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20120110,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2012/01/12 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0091270011430506 [pii]', '10.1177/0091270011430506 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;52(12):1918-26. doi: 10.1177/0091270011430506.

We prospectively measured total and specific serum IgE, eosinophils, and ECP before and 28, 100, and 180 days after HSCT. We included 30 children (age 2-17 years) undergoing HSCT. Nine patients had a history of previous atopy without being associated with pulmonary complications after HSCT until day +360. Specific IgE levels showed a decline after HSCT, associated with the absence of allergy symptoms, suggesting a reduction of atopy. Elevated total serum IgE levels occurred in seven patients on day +28 after HSCT. This elevation did not coincide with allergy symptoms. ECP showed no correlation with total allergy symptoms, eosinophilia, IgE levels, or pulmonary complications. There was a significant correlation (p = 0.0367) between ECP levels on day +28 and concurrent acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).

Recurrent minimally deleted regions (MDRs) were identified at 7q36.1 (7.7%), 9q21.32 (5%), 11p13 (2.3%), and 17q11.2 (2%). Approximately one-half of the 7q deletions were detectable only by single-nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis because of their limited size. Sequence analysis of MLL3, contained within the 7q36.1 MDR, in 46 diagnostic samples revealed one truncating mutation in a leukemia lacking a 7q deletion. Recurrent focal gains were identified at 8q24.21 (4.7%) and 11q25 (1.7%), both containing a single noncoding RNA.

Azacitidine (AZA) up-regulates the expression of tumor Ags on leukemic blasts in vitro and expands the numbers of immunomodulatory T regulatory cells (Tregs) in animal models. Reasoning that AZA might selectively augment a GVL effect, we studied the immunologic sequelae of AZA administration after allogeneic SCT. Twenty-seven patients who had undergone a reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia were treated with monthly courses of AZA, and CD8(+) T-cell responses to candidate tumor Ags and circulating Tregs were measured. AZA after transplantation was well tolerated, and its administration was associated with a low incidence of GVHD. Administration of AZA increased the number of Tregs within the first 3 months after transplantation compared with a control population (P = .0127). AZA administration also induced a cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell response to several tumor Ags, including melanoma-associated Ag 1, B melanoma antigen 1, and Wilm tumor Ag 1.

Loss of one Stat5a/b allele resulted in a decrease in BCR-ABL1-induced CML-like MPN and the appearance of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas complete deletion of Stat5a/b prevented the development of leukemia in primary recipients. However, BCR-ABL1 was expressed and active in Stat5-null leukemic stem cells, and Stat5 deletion did not prevent progression to lymphoid blast crisis or abolish established B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. JAK2(V617F) failed to induce polycythemia in recipients after deletion of Stat5a/b, although the loss of STAT5 did not prevent the development of myelofibrosis. These results demonstrate that STAT5a/b is essential for the induction of CML-like leukemia by BCR-ABL1 and of polycythemia by JAK2(V617F), and validate STAT5a/b and the genes they regulate as targets for therapy in these MPNs.","['Walz, Christoph', 'Ahmed, Wesam', 'Lazarides, Katherine', 'Betancur, Monica', 'Patel, Nihal', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Zaleskas, Virginia M', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Walz C', 'Ahmed W', 'Lazarides K', 'Betancur M', 'Patel N', 'Hennighausen L', 'Zaleskas VM', 'Van Etten RA']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20120110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Genes, abl/genetics/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation, Missense/physiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phenylalanine/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Valine/genetics']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49144-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-397554 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 12;119(15):3550-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-397554.

Our experiments demonstrate that miR-650 expression is regulated by coupled expression with its host gene for IgLlambda. This coupling provides a unique yet unobserved mechanism for microRNA gene regulation. We determine that higher expression of miR-650 is associated with a favorable CLL prognosis and influences the proliferation capacity of B cells.

Now in the era of improved conventional treatment and better prognostication of long-term outcome, a review of autologous and allogeneic HSCT in CLL treatment is warranted. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite an improved disease-free survival in some patients, multiple, prospective, randomized autologous HSCT CLL trials fail to demonstrate an overall survival benefit as compared to conventional therapy. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, although limited by donor availability, can successfully eradicate CLL with adverse prognostic features. In the older CLL patients, nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplants are better tolerated than myeloablative transplants. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplants are less effective in heavily diseased burdened patients. SUMMARY: Outside of a clinical protocol, autologous HSCT for CLL cannot be justified. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation should be considered in high-risk populations early in the disease process, when disease burden is most easily controlled. Alternative donor selection using haploidentical donors and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide has the potential to vastly increase the availability of curative therapy in CLL while retaining a low treatment-related toxicity.","['Gladstone, Douglas E', 'Fuchs, Ephraim']","['Gladstone DE', 'Fuchs E']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic modality for ALL, and this review describes the recent studies and current practice patterns concerning the who, when, and how of allo-HCT in the management of ALL. RECENT FINDINGS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ALL after first relapse and is also recommended for high-risk patients in first complete remission (CR1). Minimal residual disease evaluation and monitoring is developing as an important prognostic factor and could guide physicians in determining which patients, especially those with standard risk, might require transplant. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy allows a much higher proportion of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL patients to attain remission and proceed to transplant with improved results; posttransplant TKI maintenance therapy may also provide survival benefit. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are a reasonable alternative for patients who would otherwise be ineligible for transplant because of age or comorbidity. SUMMARY: For patients with high-risk features, there is general agreement that allo-HCT in CR1 is a potentially curative option; however, there is no consensus on early transplant for standard-risk patients.","['Khaled, Samer K', 'Thomas, Sandra H', 'Forman, Stephen J']","['Khaled SK', 'Thomas SH', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834f5c41 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2012 Mar;24(2):182-90. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834f5c41.,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3520484,,['NIHMS422643'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently the patient had extensive disseminated disease which was recognized as myeloid sarcoma but patient succumbed to the disease soon. The second case was a 25-year-old boy who presented with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction since 6 months. An endoscopy revealed diffuse gastric wall thickening which on biopsy was recognized as myeloid sarcoma but patient developed intestinal obstruction and required ileal resection for symptomatic relief, postoperative patient never recovered and succumbed to the disease. Both patients had marrow involvement by acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2) with a normal leukocyte count in peripheral blood.

The protein encoded by one of these less potent genes, BCL2L10/BCLb, was recently shown to vary dramatically in many primary human cancers by immunohistochemistry, and the protein levels were inversely correlated with survival in patients with several cancer types. We examined BCLb mRNA in a panel of human cancer cell lines and did not observe the extensive variation in mRNA that would be required to explain the vast differences in protein levels. We found that the levels of BCLb protein diminish quickly after inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, so we searched for interacting proteins that might affect posttranslational stability of BCLb. Using a variety of approaches, including immunoaffinity and mass spectrometry, we identified a protein, Ubiquilin1 (Ubqln), that specifically interacts with BCLb, and not with other anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins. Ubqln stabilizes BCLb protein, while also promoting monoubiquitination on multiple lysine residues and relocation to the cytosol. Furthermore, primary lung adencarcinomas have more Ubqln mRNA than normal adjacent lung tissue, and higher Ubqln mRNA levels are associated with shorter survival of lung cancer patients, suggesting that potentiation of the anti-apoptotic potential of BCLb through regulation of its stability by Ubqln may be an important factor in tumor progression.","['Beverly, Levi J', 'Lockwood, William W', 'Shah, Parag P', 'Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye', 'Varmus, Harold']","['Beverly LJ', 'Lockwood WW', 'Shah PP', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Varmus H']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Section, Cancer Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

However, expression of Bcl-2 proteins may be different among melanomas. Thus correlations among expression of Bcl-2-related proteins and in vivo melanoma progression, and resistance to combination therapies, was investigated. METHODS: Human A375 melanoma was injected s.c. into immunodeficient nude mice. Protein expression was studied in tumor samples obtained by laser microdisection. Transfection of siRNA or ectopic overexpression were applied to manipulate proteins which are up- or down-regulated, preferentially, during melanoma progression. Anti-bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides and chemoradiotherapy (glutathione-depleting agents, paclitaxel protein-binding particles, daunorubicin, X rays) were administered in combination. RESULTS: In vivo A375 cells down-regulated pro-apoptotic bax expression; and up-regulated anti-apoptotic bcl-2, bcl-xl, and mcl-1, however only Bcl-2 appeared critical for long-term tumor cell survival and progression in vivo. Reduction of Bcl-2, combined with partial therapies, decreased melanoma growth. But only Bcl-2 targeting plus the full combination of chemoradiotherapy eradicated A375 melanoma, and led to long-term survival (> 120 days) without recurrence in 80% of mice. Tumor regression was not due to immune stimulation. Hematology and clinical chemistry data were within accepted clinical toxicities. CONCLUSION: Strategies to target Bcl-2, may increase the effectiveness of antitumor therapies against melanomas overexpressing Bcl-2 and likely other Bcl-2-related antiapoptotic proteins.","['Mena, Salvador', 'Rodriguez, Maria L', 'Ortega, Angel', 'Priego, Sonia', 'Obrador, Elena', 'Asensi, Miguel', 'Petschen, Ignacio', 'Cerda, Miguel', 'Brown, Bob D', 'Estrela, Jose M']","['Mena S', 'Rodriguez ML', 'Ortega A', 'Priego S', 'Obrador E', 'Asensi M', 'Petschen I', 'Cerda M', 'Brown BD', 'Estrela JM']","['Department of Physiology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120110,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel)', '0 (Albumins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel', 'Albumins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Melanoma/blood/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-10-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-10-8 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2012 Jan 10;10:8. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-10-8.,,PMC3268086,,,['(c) 2012 Mena et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib is approximately 325-fold more active than imatinib in inhibiting wild-type BCR-ABL kinase in vitro and is active against a wide variety of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, except for T315I. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of dasatinib in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL, as well as summarizing its pharmacologic properties. In clinical trials, oral dasatinib was effective in achieving major or complete cytogenetic responses in both newly diagnosed and imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was likewise effective in achieving major or overall hematologic responses in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL. Responses were rapidly achieved within 1-3 months and were durable over 1-5 years of follow-up. The majority of adverse events with dasatinib were of mild or moderate severity. Fluid retention (including pleural effusion) was the most common adverse event. Hematologic abnormalities were common and cytopenias were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events. Dasatinib 100 mg administered once daily was as effective as dasatinib 70 mg administered twice daily, and was better tolerated, being associated with lower incidences of pleural effusion and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, in particular. Dasatinib was more effective than high-dose imatinib in the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML and was more effective than standard dosages of imatinib, as well as being associated with less frequent fluid retention, in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was generally equally effective in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations at baseline. Therefore, oral dasatinib is a highly effective, once-daily therapy for the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML, as well as for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic- and advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL.","['McCormack, Paul L', 'Keam, Susan J']","['McCormack PL', 'Keam SJ']","['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,2012/01/12 06:00,2012/01/12 06:01,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['1 [pii]', '10.2165/11207640-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2012 Feb 1;26(1):61-4. doi: 10.2165/11207640-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2011 Sep 10;71(13):1771-95.

In this scenario, telomere shortening ultimately results in telomere dysfunction, fusion and genomic instability, creating the large-scale rearrangements that are characteristic of these tumours. It is now becoming apparent that this paradigm may also apply to haematological malignancies; indeed these conditions have provided some of the most convincing evidence of telomere dysfunction in any malignancy. Telomere length has been shown in several malignancies to provide clinically useful prognostic information, implicating telomere dysfunction in disease progression. In these malignancies extreme telomere shortening, telomere dysfunction and fusion have all been documented and correlate with the emergence of increased genomic complexity. Telomeres may therefore represent both a clinically useful prognostic tool and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","['Jones, Ceri H', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Baird, Duncan M']","['Jones CH', 'Pepper C', 'Baird DM']","['Department of Haematology,School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120111,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Telomere/*physiology', 'Telomere Shortening/genetics']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.09022.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Mar;156(5):573-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.09022.x.

It could enhance adriamycin (doxorubicin) induced intrinsic apoptosis pathway and rectify cell cycle and some apoptosis related proteins in human breast resistant cancer MCF-7/ADM cells. This study detected Rh123 accumulation to assess the effect of HZ08 on P-glycoprotein function in human chronic leukaemia cell line K562/A02. Moreover, mitochondria membrane potential, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity were analyzed for HZ08 treatment with or without vincristine. Since pretreatment with HZ08 could also reverse the multidrug resistance to vincristine in K562/A02 cells, the individual influence of HZ08 was further detected on apoptotic regulator like Bcl-2, Bax, p53, cell cycle checkpoints and proliferation regulatory factors like survivin, hTERT, c-Myc, c-Fos, c-Jun. Finally, it revealed that HZ08 increased vincristine induced activation in intrinsic apoptosis pathway by inhibition of P-gp mediated efflux. In addition, the outstanding reversal effect of HZ08 should also attribute to its individual effect on apoptosis and proliferation related regulatory factors. It renders HZ08 possibility of application in pretreatment to reverse multidrug resistance while avoiding unexpected drug interactions and accumulative toxicity.","['Cen, Juan', 'Zhu, Yi-Lin', 'Yang, Yu', 'Zhu, Jun-Rong', 'Fang, Wei-Rong', 'Huang, Wen-Long', 'Li, Yun-Man', 'Tao, Yi-Fu']","['Cen J', 'Zhu YL', 'Yang Y', 'Zhu JR', 'Fang WR', 'Huang WL', 'Li YM', 'Tao YF']","['Department of Physiology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0', ""(N-cyano-1-((3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl)-3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-N'-octyl-2(1H)"", '-isoquinoline-carboximidamide)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2012/01/12 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2012/01/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1300565 [doi]'],ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 2011;61(11):622-30. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1300565.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological and pathological role of these pregnancy-induced immunological events is only understood in part. However, anti-IPA immunity in the mother persists for many decades after delivery and may reduce relapse in offspring with leukemia after HLA-haploidentical transplantation of maternal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We hypothesized that maternal anti-IPA immune elements cross the placenta and might confer a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect when cord blood (CB) is used in unrelated HSC transplantation. In a retrospective study of single-unit CB recipients with all grafts provided by the New York Blood Center, we show that patients with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 845) who shared one or more HLA-A, -B, or -DRB1 antigens with their CB donor's IPAs had a significant decrease in leukemic relapse posttransplantation [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.38, P < 0.001] compared with those that did not. Remarkably, relapse reduction in patients receiving CB with one HLA mismatch (HR = 0.15, P < 0.001) was not associated with an increased risk of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (HR = 1.43, P = 0.730). Our findings may explain the unexpected low relapse rate after CB transplantation, open new avenues in the study of leukemic relapse after HSC transplantation (possibly of malignancies in general), and have practical implications for CB unit selection.","['van Rood, Jon J', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Stevens, Cladd E']","['van Rood JJ', 'Scaradavou A', 'Stevens CE']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA, Leiden, The Netherlands. vanrood@europdonor.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120109,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Female', 'Fetal Blood/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1119541109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1119541109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 14;109(7):2509-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119541109.

All retroviruses, except foamy viruses, package two copies of unspliced genomic RNA into their progeny viruses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of retroviral genome packaging will aid the design of new anti-retroviral drugs targeting the packaging process and improve the efficacy of retroviral vectors. Retroviral genomes have to be specifically recognized by the cognate nucleocapsid domain of the Gag polyprotein from among an excess of cellular and spliced viral mRNA. Extensive virological and structural studies have revealed how retroviral genomic RNA is selectively packaged into the viral particles. The genomic area responsible for the packaging is generally located in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), and contains dimerization site(s). Recent studies have shown that retroviral genome packaging is modulated by structural changes of RNA at the 5' UTR accompanied by the dimerization. In this review, we focus on three representative retroviruses, Moloney murine leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2, and describe the molecular mechanism of retroviral genome packaging.","['Miyazaki, Yasuyuki', 'Miyake, Ariko', 'Nomaguchi, Masako', 'Adachi, Akio']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Miyake A', 'Nomaguchi M', 'Adachi A']","['Department of Microbiology, Institute of Health Biosciences, The University of Tokushima Graduate School Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111229,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/01/11 06:00,2012/01/11 06:01,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2011.00264 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2011 Dec 29;2:264. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2011.00264. eCollection 2011.,,PMC3247676,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NC', 'RNA', 'dimerization', 'genome', 'packaging', 'retrovirus', 'structure']",,,,,,,,,

Clinically, CML has a chronic phase that eventually evolves into an accelerated stage and blast crisis. A CML-specific immune response is thought to contribute to the control of disease. Whether the immune system can also promote disease progression is not known. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that the TNF receptor family member CD27 is present on leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and mediates effects of the immune system on CML. In a mouse model of CML, BCR/ABL+ LSCs and leukemia progenitor cells were found to express CD27. Binding of CD27 by its ligand, CD70, increased expression of Wnt target genes in LSCs by enhancing nuclear localization of active beta-catenin and TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK). This resulted in increased proliferation and differentiation of LSCs. Blocking CD27 signaling in LSCs delayed disease progression and prolonged survival. Furthermore, CD27 was expressed on CML stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow of CML patients, and CD27 signaling promoted growth of BCR/ABL+ human leukemia cells by activating the Wnt pathway. Since expression of CD70 is limited to activated lymphocytes and dendritic cells, our results reveal a mechanism by which adaptive immunity contributes to leukemia progression.

Human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, the effects of PGI(2) analog on human mDCs are unknown. In the present study, circulating mDCs were isolated from six healthy subjects. The effects of PGI(2) analogs iloprost and treprostinil on cytokine production, maturation and T-cell stimulatory function of human mDCs were investigated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of costimulatory molecules was investigated by flow cytometry. T-cell stimulatory function was investigated by measuring interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-13 and IL-10 production by T cells cocultured with iloprost-treated mDCs. Intracellular signaling was investigated by Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We found that iloprost and treprostinil induced IL-10, but suppressed TNF-alpha production in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-stimulated mDCs. This effect was reversed by the I-prostanoid (IP), E-prostanoid (EP) receptor antagonists or intracellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) chelator. Forskolin, an adenyl cyclase activator, conferred a similar effect. Iloprost and treprostinil increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, and iloprost also increased intracellular Ca(2+). Iloprost suppressed poly I:C-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phospho-p38 and phospho-activating transcription factor (ATF)2 expression. Iloprost downregulated poly I:C-induced histone H3K4 trimethylation in the TNFA gene promoter region via suppressing translocation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4)-specific methyltransferases MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) and WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5). Iloprost-treated mDCs inhibited IL-13, IFN-gamma and IL-10 production by T cells. In conclusion, PGI(2) analogs enhance IL-10 and suppress TNF-alpha expression through the IP/EP2/EP4 receptors-cAMP and EP1 receptor-Ca(2+) pathway. Iloprost suppressed TNF-alpha expression via the MAPK-p38-ATF2 pathway and epigenetic regulation by downregulation of histone H3K4 trimethylation.","['Kuo, Chang-Hung', 'Lin, Ching-Hsiung', 'Yang, San-Nan', 'Huang, Ming-Yii', 'Chen, Hsiu-Lin', 'Kuo, Po-Lin', 'Hsu, Ya-Ling', 'Huang, Shau-Ku', 'Jong, Yuh-Jyh', 'Wei, Wan-Ju', 'Chen, Yi-Pin', 'Hung, Chih-Hsing']","['Kuo CH', 'Lin CH', 'Yang SN', 'Huang MY', 'Chen HL', 'Kuo PL', 'Hsu YL', 'Huang SK', 'Jong YJ', 'Wei WJ', 'Chen YP', 'Hung CH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120509,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (PTGIR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'RUM6K67ESG (treprostinil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epoprostenol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/*pharmacology', 'Methylation', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'PPAR alpha/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00193 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00193 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2012 May 9;18:433-44. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00193.,,PMC3356435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated apoptotic signaling pathways that are involved in the inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients with uneventful outcome as well as in those with sepsis development. DNA fragmentation in peripheral blood neutrophils showed an inverse correlation with the organ dysfunction at d 10 after trauma in all patients, supporting the important role of neutrophil apoptosis regulation for patient's outcome. The expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein members A1 and Mcl-1 were found to be diminished in the septic patients at d 5 and d 10 after trauma. This decrease was also linked to an impaired intrinsic apoptosis resistance, which has been previously shown to occur in neutrophils during systemic inflammation. In patients with sepsis development, delayed neutrophil apoptosis was found to be associated with a disturbed extrinsic pathway, as demonstrated by reduced caspase-8 activity and Bid truncation. Notably, the expression of Dad1 protein, which is involved in protein N-glycosylation, was significantly increased in septic patients at d 10 after trauma. Taken together, our data demonstrate that neutrophil apoptosis is regulated by both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, depending on patient's outcome. These findings might provide a molecular basis for new strategies targeting cell death pathways in apoptosis-resistant neutrophils during systemic inflammation.","['Paunel-Gorgulu, Adnana', 'Kirichevska, Tamara', 'Logters, Tim', 'Windolf, Joachim', 'Flohe, Sascha']","['Paunel-Gorgulu A', 'Kirichevska T', 'Logters T', 'Windolf J', 'Flohe S']","['Department of Trauma and Hand Surgery, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120509,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (DAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Multiple Trauma/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Sepsis/*metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00380 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00380 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2012 May 9;18:325-35. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00380.,,PMC3356414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we prospectively assessed the outcomes of early enteral nutrition (EN) in a paediatric cohort. From 2003 to 2010, all 65 consecutive children undergoing MAC allo-SCT at our referral centre began EN the day after transplantation. Post-transplant and nutritional outcomes of patients receiving only EN (EN group, n=50) were compared with those of patients requiring additional PN (EN-PN group, n=15). In the EN group time to platelet recovery (P=0.01) and length of hospitalisation (P<0.001) were shorter, while in the EN-PN group the proportion of unrelated donors (P=0.02) and the frequency of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD; P=0.004) were higher. All patients were alive at day 100. PN was started 14 days after transplant because of poor digestive tolerance to EN or severe gut aGVHD. The body mass index Z-score in the EN-PN group decreased from transplant to discharge (P=0.02). In only 23% of cases was PN required for severely ill patients.

EP300 is one of the key genes of the innate immune system (IIS). We evaluated the influence of gene variant A>G rs20551 in EP300 in donor and/or recipient on clinical results after HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT. Patients with AA gene variant had a lower relapse incidence (31 vs 48%, P=0.025; odds ratio (OR)=1.6, P=0.05), attained better disease-free survival (AA: 53% vs AG+GG: 24%, P=0.001; OR=1.8, P=0.01), and better OS (AA: 53% vs AG+GG: 34%, P=0.001; OR=1.9, P=0.007). This beneficial association was more evident when AA gene variant was present in both donor and patient. In healthy individuals, AA gene variant was associated with lower IL2 production after a mitogenic stimuli, higher CD4+ cell response after CMV infection, and higher expression of innate immune genes (IRF-3 and MIF), cell cycle genes (AURKB, CCNA2 and CCNB1), lymphocyte survival genes (NFAT5 and SLC38A2), and with a lower expression of P53 compared with recessive GG gene variant.

In this report, we show that the signal-transducing adaptor protein-2 (STAP-2) is involved in BCR-ABL activity. We demonstrate that STAP-2 bound to BCR-ABL, and BCR and ABL proteins, depending on the STAP-2 Src homology 2-like domain. BCR-ABL phosphorylates STAP-2 Tyr250 and the phosphorylated STAP-2 in turn upregulated BCR-ABL phosphorylation, leading to enhanced activation of downstream signaling molecules including ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), BCL-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large) and BCL-2(B-cell lymphoma 2). In addition, STAP-2 interacts with BCR-ABL to alter chemokine receptor expression leading to downregulation of CXCR4 and upregulation of CCR7. The interaction between STAP-2 and BCR-ABL plays a crucial role in conferring a growth advantage and resistance to imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, as well as tumor progression. Notably, mice injected with BCR-ABL/STAP-2-expressing Ba/F3 cells developed lymph node enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly. Moreover, suppression of STAP-2 in K562 CML cells resulted in no tumor formation in mice. Our results demonstrate a critical contribution of STAP-2 in BCR-ABL activity, and suggest that STAP-2 might be an important candidate for drug development for patients with CML. Furthermore, the expression of STAP-2 provides useful information for estimating the characteristics of individual CML clones.","['Sekine, Y', 'Ikeda, O', 'Mizushima, A', 'Ueno, Y', 'Muromoto, R', 'Yoshimura, A', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Oritani, K', 'Matsuda, T']","['Sekine Y', 'Ikeda O', 'Mizushima A', 'Ueno Y', 'Muromoto R', 'Yoshimura A', 'Kanakura Y', 'Oritani K', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120109,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (STAP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism']",2012/01/11 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011604 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.604 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Oct 4;31(40):4384-96. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.604.

Hence, any mutation or error that occurs along the way can result in extensive damage, which is expressed in various ways in the embryo and can result in immune pathogenesis, including immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases, when lymphocyte development is altered. A number of studies have been carried out to look at the genes regulating transcription in tissue differentiation, including the transcription factors Pbx1. This gene is of particular interest to us as we have identified that it is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility (Cuda et al., in press).

These mice exhibit many features of MPNs, including thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, Epo-independent colony formation, characteristic bone marrow histology, expansion of stem and progenitor compartments, and spontaneous transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The MPN phenotype is transplantable to secondary recipient mice. NF-E2 can alter histone modifications, and NF-E2 transgenic mice show hypoacetylation of histone H3. Treatment of mice with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC-I) vorinostat restored physiological levels of histone H3 acetylation, decreased NF-E2 expression, and normalized platelet numbers. Similarly, MPN patients treated with an HDAC-I exhibited a decrease in NF-E2 expression. These data establish a role for NF-E2 in the pathophysiology of MPNs and provide a molecular rationale for investigating epigenetic alterations as novel targets for rationally designed MPN therapies.","['Kaufmann, Kai B', 'Grunder, Albert', 'Hadlich, Tobias', 'Wehrle, Julius', 'Gothwal, Monika', 'Bogeska, Ruzhica', 'Seeger, Thalia S', 'Kayser, Sarah', 'Pham, Kien-Binh', 'Jutzi, Jonas S', 'Ganzenmuller, Lucas', 'Steinemann, Doris', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Wagner, Julia M', 'Jung, Manfred', 'Will, Britta', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Aumann, Konrad', 'Werner, Martin', 'Gunther, Thomas', 'Schule, Roland', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Pahl, Heike L']","['Kaufmann KB', 'Grunder A', 'Hadlich T', 'Wehrle J', 'Gothwal M', 'Bogeska R', 'Seeger TS', 'Kayser S', 'Pham KB', 'Jutzi JS', 'Ganzenmuller L', 'Steinemann D', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Wagner JM', 'Jung M', 'Will B', 'Steidl U', 'Aumann K', 'Werner M', 'Gunther T', 'Schule R', 'Rambaldi A', 'Pahl HL']","['Department of Experimental Anaesthesiology, Center for Clinical Research, University Hospital Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120109,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Phenotype']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110540 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110540 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2012 Jan 16;209(1):35-50. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110540.

We analyzed their value in the routine clinical setting in 131 patients with chronic phase CML in whom imatinib was applied as first- or second-line treatment. A total of 1,118 measurements were obtained by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay in patients treated with daily dose of imatinib ranging from 100 to 800 mg. Samples were obtained from 1 to 96 h after drug ingestion. High inter (36%) and intraindividual variability (9-33%) of IPL was observed. For analysis of correlation of IPL with treatment response, two sets of samples were selected according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria. The first set consisted of 241 samples taken 24 +/- 2 h after dosing in 54 patients, and the second one consisted of 329 samples taken 24 +/- 4 h after imatinib ingestion in 84 patients. In both sets, only patients treated with 400 mg imatinib once daily for at least 18 months were included. From multiple measurements in individual patients, mean IPL were used.

We believe that this was due to the differences in patients' compliance, leukemia biology, and other variables that are difficult to eliminate in the routine clinical practice.

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations are associated with acquired imatinib resistance, but their role in primary resistance is uncertain. Using highly sensitive ligation-PCR and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we identified baseline TKD mutations in 21% and 42% of imatinib-naive patients with newly diagnosed (n=26) or recurrent (n=65) Ph+ ALL, respectively (P=ns). Within 4 weeks of starting the imatinib treatment, absolute levels of mutant bcr-abl transcripts increased significantly in patients with advanced, but not with de novo, Ph+ ALL. The net expansion of pre-existing mutant clones during imatinib treatment resulted in the rapid appearance of initially undetectable TKD mutations, which after 4 weeks were detectable in 70% of patients with advanced disease. There was a high degree of concordance between the type of mutations detected at relapse and during initial imatinib treatment. The profoundly different outgrowth dynamics of leukemic clones with bcr-abl mutations in imatinib-treated patients who differ in their disease history, provides clinical-translational evidence for a contributory role of non-mutational resistance mechanisms, possibly induced by prior chemotherapy. Moreover, the prevalence of pre-existing, clinically relevant TKD may have been underestimated in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive patients with Ph+ ALL.","['Pfeifer, H', 'Lange, T', 'Wystub, S', 'Wassmann, B', 'Maier, J', 'Binckebanck, A', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Stelljes, M', 'Schmalzing, M', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Wunderle, L', 'Serve, H', 'Bruck, P', 'Schmidt, A', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Ottmann, O G']","['Pfeifer H', 'Lange T', 'Wystub S', 'Wassmann B', 'Maier J', 'Binckebanck A', 'Giagounidis A', 'Stelljes M', 'Schmalzing M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Wunderle L', 'Serve H', 'Bruck P', 'Schmidt A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20125 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1475-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.5.

Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, a family of anti-apoptotic proteins, have an important role in evasion of apoptosis, as they can both block apoptosis-signaling pathways and promote survival. High expression of IAP proteins is observed in multiple cancers, including hematological malignancies, and has been associated with unfavorable prognosis and poor patients' outcome. Therefore, IAP proteins are currently considered as promising molecular targets for therapy. Indeed, drug-discovery approaches over the last decade aiming at neutralizing IAP proteins have resulted in the generation of small-molecule inhibitors or antisense oligonucleotides that demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities in preclinical studies. As some of these strategies have already entered the stage of clinical evaluation, for example, in leukemia, an update on this promising molecular-targeted strategy to interfere with apoptotic pathways is of broad interest.","['Fulda, S']",['Fulda S'],"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Drug Discovery', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20124 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1155-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.4.

METHODS: The mRNA levels of MMSA-1 and DKK1 genes were detected by RT-PCR in patients with MM, leukemia, non-tumor diseases and in the healthy donors, respectively. Then, their correlation was analyzed. The effects of Ibandronate Sodium on the cell cycle and early apoptosis of 8226 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the effect on its protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Construct MMSA-1 eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Myc-MMSA-1, and antibody immunohistochemistry was applied to study the cellular localization of the protein. RESULTS: MMSA-1 gene was expressed in all of the specimens described above, and the mRNA level in MM was much higher than that in the others, just like DKK1 gene. More than that, their expression exhibited a significant positive correlation. Ibandronate Sodium could inhibit cell proliferation by a cell-cycle arrest in S-phase. By reducing cell maturation promoting factor release, it stopped the cell cycle, promoted their early apoptosis and decreased the protein expression of MMSA-1. MMSA-1 protein principally distributed on cell membranes, however, there are a small quantity in cytalplasm.

Dovitinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and tigatuzumab, a novel humanized anti-human death receptor 5 (DR5) agonistic antibody, are both under clinical investigations in HCC. Here, we report that dovitinib sensitizes resistant HCC cells to TRAIL- and tigatuzumab-induced apoptosis through inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Our data indicate that HCC cells showed significant resistance to TRAIL- and tigatuzumab-induced apoptosis. The combination of dovitinib and tigatuzumab restored the sensitivity of HCC cells to TRAIL- and tigatuzumab-induced apoptosis. Dovitinib down-regulated phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (p-STAT3) and subsequently reduced the protein levels of STAT3-regulated proteins, Mcl-1, survivin and cylcin D1, in TRAIL-treated HCC cells. Knockdown of STAT3 by RNA-interference overcame apoptotic resistance to TRAIL in HCC cells, and ectopic expression of STAT3 in HCC cells abolished the sensitizing effect of dovitinib on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Importantly, silencing SHP-1 by RNA-interference reduced the effects of dovitinib and TRAIL on p-STAT3 and apoptosis, whereas co-treatment of TRAIL and dovitinib increased the activity of SHP-1. Moreover, in vivo the combination of tigatuzumab and dovitinib inhibited Huh-7 xenograft tumor growth. In conclusion, dovitinib sensitizes resistant HCC cells to TRAIL- and tigatuzumab-induced apoptosis through a novel machinery: SHP-1 dependent STAT3 inhibition.","['Chen, Kuen-Feng', 'Chen, Hui-Ling', 'Liu, Chun-Yu', 'Tai, Wei-Tien', 'Ichikawa, Kimihisa', 'Chen, Pei-Jer', 'Cheng, Ann-Lii']","['Chen KF', 'Chen HL', 'Liu CY', 'Tai WT', 'Ichikawa K', 'Chen PJ', 'Cheng AL']","['Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. kfchen1970@ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120102,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0', '(4-amino-5-fluoro-3-(5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinolin-2(1', 'H)-one)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '237GB6IDKO (tigatuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00951-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Mar 15;83(6):769-77. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.035.

No data is available on Tregs in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a disease entity characterized by less than 5000/microL circulating clonal B-cells in absence of other features of lymphoproliferative disorders. We used multicolour flow cytometry to evaluate the number of circulating Tregs in 56 patients with &#x0022;clinical&#x0022; MBL, 74 patients with previously untreated CLL and 40 healthy subjects. MBL patients showed a lower absolute number of Tregs, compared to CLL patients, but slightly higher than controls. Moreover, the absolute cell number of Tregs directly correlated both with more advanced Rai/Binet clinical stages and peripheral blood B-cell lymphocytosis. Of note, the absolute number of Tregs was found lower in MBL patients than in CLL patients staged as 0/A Rai/Binet. The study showed that Treg increase gradually from normal subjects to &#x0022;clinical&#x0022; MBL patients and are significantly higher in CLL patients as compared to MBL patients. Moreover, a significant direct relationship was found between higher Treg values and a higher tumor burden expressed by B-lymphocytosis or more advanced clinical stages. In light of this data, MBL seems to be a preliminary phase preceding CLL. The progressive increase of Treg numbers might contribute both to the clinical evolution of MBL to overt CLL and to CLL progression.","[""D'Arena, G"", 'Rossi, G', 'Minervini, M M', 'Savino, L', ""D'Auria, F"", 'Laurenti, L', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Deaglio, S', 'Biagi, A', 'De Martino, L', 'De Feo, V', 'Statuto, T', 'Musto, P', 'Del Poeta, G']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Rossi G', 'Minervini MM', 'Savino L', ""D'Auria F"", 'Laurenti L', 'Del Principe MI', 'Deaglio S', 'Biagi A', 'De Martino L', 'De Feo V', 'Statuto T', 'Musto P', 'Del Poeta G']","['Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy. giovannidarena@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10 [pii]', '10.1177/039463201102400410 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2011 Oct-Dec;24(4):915-23. doi: 10.1177/039463201102400410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors are experiencing tremendous clinical benefits from targeted therapies in the form of kinase inhibitors. These drugs marked a revolution in cancer treatment, not only for their safety and efficacy, but also because they continue to expand our knowledge of the pathophysiology of cancer. OBJECTIVE: To provide a summary of the biologic predictors of gastrointestinal stromal tumor behavior and response to targeted therapies that currently help guide clinical decision making. DATA SOURCES: Published articles pertaining to the diagnosis, molecular genetics, prognostication, clinical behavior, and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as experiences in a multidisciplinary sarcoma clinic. CONCLUSIONS: In gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the strongest predictor of response to targeted therapies is the mutational status of KIT or PDGFRA. Patients whose tumors harbor a KIT exon 11 mutation benefit the most from imatinib mesylate therapy, in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Conversely, tumors without detectable mutations in either gene (""wild-type"" gastrointestinal stromal tumors) are generally not responsive to imatinib mesylate.","['Marrari, Andrea', 'Wagner, Andrew J', 'Hornick, Jason L']","['Marrari A', 'Wagner AJ', 'Hornick JL']","['Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120109,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2011-0082-RA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2012 May;136(5):483-9. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2011-0082-RA.

It was previously reported that Mashhad, in northeastern Iran, is a new endemic region of HTLV-I. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of HTLV-I in Sabzevar, located in the southeast of Mashhad. In this cross-sectional study 1445 individuals were selected by multistage cluster sampling. Serum samples were screened for anti-HTLV-I antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); all of the ELISA-positive samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Long terminal repeat (LTR) sequencing was carried out to determine the type of HTLV-I in Sabzevar. In the primary screening by ELISA, 26/1445 (1.8%) of those sampled were reactive for HTLV-I antibody. Twenty-four out of 26 samples were confirmed HTLV-I infection by PCR (24/1445). The overall prevalence of HTLV-I infection in Sabzevar is 1.66%. The prevalence of the virus infection in men and women was 2.42% (11/455) and 1.31% (13/989), respectively. Seroprevalence was associated with age, increasing significantly among those older than 30 years (p=0.015), and a history of surgery (p=0.002), imprisonment (p=0.018), and hospitalization (p=0.005). Three out of 24 positive HTLV-I samples were selected for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of LTR. The results showed that HTLV-I in Sabzevar belonged to the cosmopolitan subtype. The present study showed Sabzevar is a new endemic area for HTLV-I infection. Our study emphasizes that systemic HTLV-I screening of blood donors in Sabzevar and other cities in Khorasan province is important and should be taken into account.","['Azarpazhooh, Mahmoud Reza', 'Hasanpour, Kazem', 'Ghanbari, Mohsen', 'Rezaee, S A Rahim', 'Mashkani, Baratali', 'Hedayati-Moghaddam, Mohammad Reza', 'Valizadeh, Narges', 'Farid Hosseini, Reza', 'Foroghipoor, Mohsen', 'Soltanifar, Azadeh', 'Sahebari, Maryam', 'Azadmanesh, Keyhan', 'Hassanshahi, Gholahossein', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Azarpazhooh MR', 'Hasanpour K', 'Ghanbari M', 'Rezaee SA', 'Mashkani B', 'Hedayati-Moghaddam MR', 'Valizadeh N', 'Farid Hosseini R', 'Foroghipoor M', 'Soltanifar A', 'Sahebari M', 'Azadmanesh K', 'Hassanshahi G', 'Rafatpanah H']","['Department of Neurology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Endemic Diseases/statistics & numerical data', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/12/28 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/AID.2011.0248 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2012 Sep;28(9):1095-1101. doi: 10.1089/AID.2011.0248.

RECENT ADVANCES: This essay summarizes a few paradigmatic examples of redox regulation and signal modulation that emerged from, or were confirmed by, studies on the development, differentiation and function of B cells. CRITICAL ISSUES: While a role for intra- and intercellular redox signaling has been firmly established for differentiating B cells, many fundamental questions remain open, including the cellular sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the spatial and temporal constraints of ROS signaling, and the functional role of the antioxidant response.

METHOD OF STUDY: Early pregnant rats were randomized into normal group (N), group treated with mifepristone (M), acupuncture treatment group (A), and progestin treatment group (P). The model of blastocyst implantation obstacle in groups M, A, and P was established with mifepristone. Bilateral 'Housanli' and 'Sanyinjiao' were needled in group A. The expression of interleukin (IL)-12, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), LIFR protein, and mRNA in endometrium were detected. RESULTS: Positivity of the protein expression of IL-12, LIF, and LIFR in the endometrium was significantly higher in groups N, A, and P; positivity of the mRNA of IL-12 and LIF in the endometrium was significantly higher in groups N, A, and P. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could improve the poor receptive state of endometrium by promoting LIF and IL-12 secretion to improve blastocyst implantation.","['Gui, Juan', 'Xiong, Fan', 'Yang, Wei', 'Li, Jing', 'Huang, Guangying']","['Gui J', 'Xiong F', 'Yang W', 'Li J', 'Huang G']","['Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120109,Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Progestins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal/pharmacology', '*Acupuncture Therapy', 'Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Endometrium/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Progestins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism']",2012/01/11 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01097.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2012 May;67(5):383-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01097.x.

Histopathologically, osteosarcoma is characterized by complex mixtures of different cell types with bone formation. The role of environmental factors in the formation of such a complicated tissue structure as osteosarcoma remains to be elucidated. Here, a newly established murine osteosarcoma model was used to clarify the roles of environmental factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (Fgf2) or leukemia-inhibitory factor (Lif) in the maintenance of osteosarcoma cells in an immature state. These factors were highly expressed in tumor environmental stromal cells, rather than in osteosarcoma cells, and they potently suppressed osteogenic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation revealed that the hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 induced by these factors affected in the process of osteosarcoma differentiation. In addition, Fgf2 enhanced both proliferation and migratory activity of osteosarcoma cells and modulated the sensitivity of cells to an anticancer drug. The results of the present study suggest that the histology of osteosarcoma tumors which consist of immature tumor cells and pathologic bone formations could be generated dependent on the distribution of such environmental factors. The combined blockade of the signaling pathways of several growth factors, including Fgf2, might be useful in controlling the aggressiveness of osteosarcoma.","['Shimizu, Takatsune', 'Ishikawa, Tomoki', 'Iwai, Sayaka', 'Ueki, Arisa', 'Sugihara, Eiji', 'Onishi, Nobuyuki', 'Kuninaka, Shinji', 'Miyamoto, Takeshi', 'Toyama, Yoshiaki', 'Ijiri, Hiroshi', 'Mori, Hajime', 'Matsuzaki, Yumi', 'Yaguchi, Tomonori', 'Nishio, Hiroshi', 'Kawakami, Yutaka', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Saya, Hideyuki']","['Shimizu T', 'Ishikawa T', 'Iwai S', 'Ueki A', 'Sugihara E', 'Onishi N', 'Kuninaka S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Toyama Y', 'Ijiri H', 'Mori H', 'Matsuzaki Y', 'Yaguchi T', 'Nishio H', 'Kawakami Y', 'Ikeda Y', 'Saya H']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120106,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-11-0347 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0347 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2012 Mar;10(3):454-68. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0347.

However, most cultured HSPCs are actively cycling, and show a homing and engraftment defect compared with the predominantly quiescent noncultured HSPCs. We previously showed that HSPCs make contact with osteoblasts in vitro via a polarized membrane domain enriched in adhesion molecules such as tetraspanins. Here we show that increased cell cycling during ex vivo culture of HSPCs resulted in disruption of this membrane domain, as evidenced by disruption of polarity of the tetraspanin CD82. Chemical disruption or antibody-mediated blocking of CD82 on noncultured HSPCs resulted in decreased stromal cell adhesion, homing, and engraftment in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency IL-2gamma(null) (NSG) mice compared with HSPCs with an intact domain. Most leukemic blasts were actively cycling and correspondingly displayed a loss of domain polarity and decreased homing in NSG mice compared with normal HSPCs. We conclude that quiescent cells, unlike actively cycling cells, display a polarized membrane domain enriched in tetraspanins that mediates homing and engraftment, providing a mechanistic explanation for the homing/engraftment defect of cycling cells and a potential new therapeutic target to enhance engraftment.","['Larochelle, Andre', 'Gillette, Jennifer M', 'Desmond, Ronan', 'Ichwan, Brian', 'Cantilena, Amy', 'Cerf, Alexandra', 'Barrett, A John', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Lippincott-Schwartz, Jennifer', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Larochelle A', 'Gillette JM', 'Desmond R', 'Ichwan B', 'Cantilena A', 'Cerf A', 'Barrett AJ', 'Wayne AS', 'Lippincott-Schwartz J', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Kangai-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Tetraspanins/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46042-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-371583 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 23;119(8):1848-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-371583.

Walsh and Kaiser (Radiat Environ Biophys 50:21-35, 2011) advocate a weighted averaging of the models, where the weights are a function of overall model goodness of fit and degrees of freedom. They apply this method to analyses of radiation-leukemia mortality associations among Japanese A-bomb survivors. We caution against such an approach, noting that the proposed model averaging approach prioritizes the inclusion of covariates that are strong predictors of the outcome, but which may be irrelevant as confounders of the association of interest, and penalizes adjustment for covariates that are confounders of the association of interest, but may contribute little to overall model goodness of fit. We offer a simple illustration of how this approach can lead to biased results. The proposed model averaging approach may also be suboptimal as way to handle competing model forms for an exposure-response association of interest, given adjustment for the same set of confounders; alternative approaches, such as hierarchical regression, may provide a more useful way to stabilize risk estimates in this setting.","['Richardson, David B', 'Cole, Stephen R']","['Richardson DB', 'Cole SR']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Comment']",20120107,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-011-0395-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2012 Mar;51(1):93-5; discussion 97-100. doi: 10.1007/s00411-011-0395-4.

The resulting PML-RARalpha oncogene product interferes with multiple regulatory pathways associated with myeloid differentiation, including normal PML and RARalpha functions. The standard treatment for APL includes anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic agents plus the RARalpha agonist all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Relapse, which is often accompanied by ATRA resistance, occurs in an appreciable frequency of treated patients. One potential mechanism suggested by model experiments featuring the selection of ATRA-resistant APL cell lines involves ATRA-resistant versions of the PML-RARalpha oncogene, where the relevant mutations localize to the RARalpha ligand-binding domain (LBD). Such mutations may act by compromising agonist binding, but other mechanisms are possible. Here, we studied the molecular consequence of ATRA resistance by use of circular dichroism, protease resistance, and fluorescence anisotropy assays employing peptides derived from the NCOR nuclear corepressor and the ACTR nuclear coactivator. The consequences of the mutations on global structure and cofactor interaction functions were assessed quantitatively, providing insights into the basis of agonist resistance. Attenuated cofactor switching and increased protease resistance represent features of the LBDs of ATRA-resistant PML-RARalpha, and these properties may be recapitulated in the full-length oncoproteins.","['Farris, Mindy', 'Lague, Astrid', 'Manuelyan, Zara', 'Statnekov, Jacob', 'Francklyn, Christopher']","['Farris M', 'Lague A', 'Manuelyan Z', 'Statnekov J', 'Francklyn C']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Vermont, Health Sciences Complex, Burlington, Vermont 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120107,United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorescence Polarization/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry', 'Proteolysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*chemistry', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/pharmacology']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/22 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/prot.24010 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2012 Apr;80(4):1095-109. doi: 10.1002/prot.24010.

The most common cytogenetic abnormalities with independent prognostic significance in CLL are 13q14, ATM and TP53 deletions and trisomy 12. However, CLL displays a great genetic and biological heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to analyze the genomic imbalances in CLL cytogenetic subsets from both genomic and gene expression perspectives to identify new recurrent alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The genomic imbalances and expression levels of 67 patients were analyzed. The novel recurrent abnormalities detected with bacterial artificial chromosome array were confirmed by FISH and oligonucleotide microarrays. In all cases, gene expression profiling was assessed. RESULTS: Copy number alterations were identified in 75% of cases. Overall, the results confirmed FISH studies for the regions frequently involved in CLL and also defined a new recurrent gain on chromosome 20q13.12, in 19% (13/67) of the CLL patients. Oligonucleotide expression correlated with the regions of loss or gain of genomic material, suggesting that the changes in gene expression are related to alterations in copy number. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the presence of a recurrent gain in 20q13.12 associated with overexpression of the genes located in this region, in CLL cytogenetic subgroups.","['Rodriguez, A E', 'Robledo, C', 'Garcia, J L', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Hernandez, J A', 'Sandoval, V', 'Garcia de Coca, A', 'Recio, I', 'Risueno, A', 'Martin-Nunez, G', 'Garcia, E', 'Fisac, R', 'Conde, J', 'de Las Rivas, J', 'Hernandez, J M']","['Rodriguez AE', 'Robledo C', 'Garcia JL', 'Gonzalez M', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Hernandez JA', 'Sandoval V', 'Garcia de Coca A', 'Recio I', 'Risueno A', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'Garcia E', 'Fisac R', 'Conde J', 'de Las Rivas J', 'Hernandez JM']","['IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca.', 'IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca.', 'Instituto de Estudios de Ciencias de la Salud de Castilla y Leon (IECSCYL)-HUSAL, Castill y Leon.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Infanta Leonor, Madrid.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Virgen Blanca, Leon.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valladolid.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles, Avila.', 'Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia.', 'Genomics and Proteomics Unit, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital del Rio Hortega, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca.', 'IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca; Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca.

Central venous catheter (CVC) removal for occult septic thrombophlebitis challenges current strategy in neutropenic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated infection-related mortality in 100 acute leukemia patients, with CVC-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) after chemotherapy, who systematically underwent ultrasonography to identify the need for catheter removal. Their infection-related mortality was compared with that of a historical cohort of 100 acute leukemia patients, with CRBSI after chemotherapy, managed with a clinically driven strategy. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was administered in all patients analyzed. RESULTS: In the prospective series, 30/100 patients required catheter removal for ultrasonography-detected septic thrombophlebitis after 1 median day from BSI onset; 70/100 patients without septic thrombophlebitis retained their CVC. In the historical cohort, 60/100 patients removed the catheter (persistent fever, 40 patients; persistent BSI, 10 patients; or clinically manifest septic thrombophlebitis, 10 patients) after 8 median days from BSI onset; 40/100 patients retained the CVC because they had not clinical findings of complicated infection. At 30 days median follow-up, one patient died for infection in the ultrasonography-assisted group versus 17 patients in the historical cohort (P<0.01). With the ultrasonography-driven strategy, early septic thrombophlebitis detection and prompt CVC removal decrease infection-related mortality, whereas clinically driven strategy leads to inappropriate number, reasons, and timeliness of CVC removal. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography is an easy imaging diagnostic tool enabling effective and safe management of patients with acute leukemia and CRBSI.","['Picardi, M', 'Pagliuca, S', 'Chiurazzi, F', 'Iula, D', 'Catania, M', 'Rossano, F', 'Pane, F']","['Picardi M', 'Pagliuca S', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Iula D', 'Catania M', 'Rossano F', 'Pane F']","['Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology.

Two of those patients developed deep venous thrombosis at the time of peaked endogenous thrombin generation. Thrombin generation in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to BFM protocols is significantly higher during the induction phase compared with reinduction and is not substantially affected by hypofibrinogenemia and/or antithrombin deficiency.

METHODS: Patients with one of 10 common invasive cancers were followed from 1975 to 2008 in 9 registries participating in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPTC were determined by the multiple primary-SIR program in SEER*Stat. RESULTS: A total of 2502 SPTCs were observed. Greatly elevated SIRs for SPTC were noted for 9 of 10 evaluated cancers in the 12 months after initial diagnosis. The SIRs remained elevated 12-59 months after diagnosis for all cancers except leukemia, uterine, and bladder cancers. Increased risks persisted 60-119 months beyond diagnosis for renal (SIR 2.56) and breast cancer (SIR 1.16); and 120+ months for renal cancer (SIR 2.46). Increased SPTC risk after renal and female breast cancers was mostly seen in nonirradiated patients. The principal histology association was between papillary thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: Many common cancers are associated with increased risk of SPTC beyond 12 months of initial diagnosis. Although this can be explained partly by continued surveillance bias, radiation effects, and known rare familial associations for some tumors, these factors alone are unlikely to explain the persistent, significant two-way association with renal and breast cancers. Additional research is needed to further define the biological and environmental mechanisms underlying these associations.","['Lal, Geeta', 'Groff, Megan', 'Howe, James R', 'Weigel, Ronald J', 'Sugg, Sonia L', 'Lynch, Charles F']","['Lal G', 'Groff M', 'Howe JR', 'Weigel RJ', 'Sugg SL', 'Lynch CF']","['Department of Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.

We have recently shown the key role of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a phosphoprotein involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement, in the control of human lymphocyte migration and in brain targeting in animal models of virus-induced neuroinflammation. Using lymphocytes cloned from infected patients and chronically infected T cells, we found that HTLV-1 affects CRMP2 activity, resulting in an increased migratory potential. Elevated CRMP2 expression accompanies a higher phosphorylation level of CRMP2 and its more pronounced adhesion to tubulin and actin. CRMP2 forms, a full length and a shorter, cleaved one, are also affected. Tax transfection and extinction strategies show the involvement of this viral protein in enhanced full-length and active CRMP2, resulting in prominent migratory rate. A role for other viral proteins in CRMP2 phosphorylation is suspected. Full-length CRMP2 confers a migratory advantage possibly by preempting the negative effect of short CRMP2 we observe on T lymphocyte migration. In addition, HTLV-1-induced migration seems, in part, supported by the ability of infected cell to increase the proteosomal degradation of short CRMP2. Finally, gene expression in CD69(+) cells selected from patients suggests that HTLV-1 has the capacity to influence the CRMP2/PI3K/Akt axis thus to positively control cytoskeleton organization and lymphocyte migration. Our data provide an additional clue to understanding the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes into various tissues and suggest that the regulation of CRMP2 activity by virus infection is a novel aspect of neuroinflammation.","['Varrin-Doyer, Michel', 'Nicolle, Adeline', 'Marignier, Romain', 'Cavagna, Sylvie', 'Benetollo, Claire', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Giraudon, Pascale']","['Varrin-Doyer M', 'Nicolle A', 'Marignier R', 'Cavagna S', 'Benetollo C', 'Wattel E', 'Giraudon P']","['INSERM U1028, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5292, Equipe Neurooncologie-Neuroinflammation, F-69000 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120106,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (collapsin response mediator protein-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', '*Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeleton/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/virology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Viral Proteins']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101562 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101562 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Feb 1;188(3):1222-33. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101562.

Because of the occurrence of resistance with imatinib, new drugs have been developed recently, two of which, nilotinib and dasatinib, are being registered for frontline therapy. However physicians may be confused as to how to treat and manage their newly diagnosed patients. The value of new scoring systems and well known surrogate markers such as cytogenetic and molecular responses as well as recent data from phase II or III trials are presented and discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The analysis of trials comparing 400 mg of imatinib to higher doses suggests that 400 mg still seems to be the appropriate initial dose. However, doses of 800 mg could be proposed for high-risk patients or for those with slower response. Sokal and Euro scoring systems are useful and should be calculated before initiating the treatment. The achievement of early complete cytogenetic response is still a valid surrogate marker, although close molecular monitoring is also mandatory. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proved their efficacy by reducing the rate of progression to advanced phases. SUMMARY: Long-term follow-up of ongoing trials investigating tyrosine kinase inhibitors, alone or in combination with interferon, will assess their efficacy on overall survival.","['Guilhot, Francois', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Tomowiak, Cecile']","['Guilhot F', 'Roy L', 'Tomowiak C']","['Centre Investigation Clinique Inserm CIC 0802, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France. f.guilhot@chu-poitiers.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff610 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Mar;19(2):102-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff610.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: As treatment-related mortality rates have been reduced, more practitioners and patients are amenable to use of this modality if the risk : benefit ratio appears justified. Clinical factors initially were used to identify patients at highest risk for relapse using conventional approaches, a strategy supplanted by one based on the genetic alterations of the leukemia cells. More recently, molecular factors are used to identify such candidates; the issue of which first remission acute myeloid leukemia patients receive hematopoietic cell transplantation is referred to as risk stratification. SUMMARY: With significant improvements in donor : recipient matching and a more varied graft source, greater numbers of patients can proceed to alternative donor hematopoietic cell transplantation. Advancing age appears to be less of a barrier and outcomes are reasonable in patients with good performance status and few comorbidities. The most interesting aspect of the moving target of which patients to take to hematopoietic cell transplantation is to define those with favorable-risk disease and avoid the procedure, while using the armamentarium at hand to identify those at higher and highest risk for relapse as the group most likely to benefit. The field, however, still awaits the data that demonstrate improved outcome in these poor-risk patients using the hematopoietic cell transplantation approach.","['Paun, Oana', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Paun O', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Patient Selection', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff54b [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Mar;19(2):95-101. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff54b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current review, advances in risk stratification, protocols involving novel agents and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) will be discussed in light of the vision of personalized therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: The role of ASCT in relapsed/refractory AML is well established and has been recently confirmed as mandatory for cure. Retrospective observations of different large cohorts categorized patients with early relapse, poor cytogenetics or fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 internal tandem duplication mutation as the most challenging population. Multiple novel agents have been studied with various promising results; however, these agents can only serve as a bridge to transplantation. If ASCT is not an option, therapy should focus on prolongation of patient's life at its best possible quality. Accumulated molecular data open new horizons for personalizing therapy and assigning each patient to the drug or protocol from which the patient will benefit most. SUMMARY: Relapsed/refractory AML is a heterogeneous disease and no uniform protocol will provide cure to all patients. Molecular tests may contribute to future personalizing therapy resulting in improved outcome. Meanwhile, novel and more effective induction and postremission protocols are warranted to lower the relapse rate.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ofran Y', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. y_ofran@rambam.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff4e1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Mar;19(2):89-94. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ff4e1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transactivation and coactivation functions of Zac1 may occur at non-promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) sites in the presence of other PML-NB components, including ubiquitin-conjugating 9 (Ubc9). It is unclear whether post-translational modification of Zac1 by the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO plays a role in the coactivation functions of Zac1 for the regulation of the p21 gene. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the two SUMO-binding lysine residues of Zac1, K237 and K424, repress the transactivation activity of Zac1. Studies using a SUMO-1 C-terminal di-glycine motif mutant that is deficient in the ability to form covalent bonds with lysines, SUMO-1 (GA), and a dominant-negative Ubc9 construct (C93S) indicated that SUMO-1 might regulate Zac1 transactivation and coactivation via a non-covalent interaction. Unlike the wild-type Zac1, which induced apoptosis, the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant had the ability to induce autophagy. The functional role of p21 remains to be investigated. SUMO-1 selectively suppressed the induction of the p21 gene and protein by wild-type Zac1 but not by the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant. Moreover, wild-type Ubc9 but not Ubc9 (C93S) further potentiated the suppression of SUMO-1 in all Zac1-induced p21 promoter activities. Our data reveal that p21 may be an important factor for the prevention of Zac1-induced apoptosis without affecting autophagosome formation. This work indicates that Zac1 functions are regulated, at least in part, via non-covalent interactions with SUMO-1 for the induction of p21, which is important for the modulation of apoptosis.","['Liu, Shu-Ting', 'Chang, Yung-Lung', 'Wang, Wei-Ming', 'Chung, Min-Huey', 'Lin, Wei-Shiang', 'Chou, Wei-Yuan', 'Huang, Shih-Ming']","['Liu ST', 'Chang YL', 'Wang WM', 'Chung MH', 'Lin WS', 'Chou WY', 'Huang SM']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei 114, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111227,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (PLAGL1 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(11)00359-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2011.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2012 Mar;44(3):547-55. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2011.12.012.

Criticism of this work questioned the use of the Mann-Whitney test for determining change in element concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that Mann-Whitney is appropriate for comparing background element concentrations to possibly elevated concentrations in environmental media. Given that Mann-Whitney tests for differences in shapes of distributions, inter-tree variability (e.g., ""coefficient of median variation"") was calculated for each measured element across trees within subsites and time periods. For W and Co, the metals of highest interest in Fallon, inter-tree variability was always higher within versus outside of Fallon. For calibration purposes, this entire analysis was repeated at a different town, Sweet Home, Oregon, which has a known tungsten-powder facility, and inter-tree variability of W in tree rings confirmed the establishment date of that facility. Mann-Whitney testing of simulated data also confirmed its appropriateness for analysis of data affected by point-source contamination. This research adds important new dimensions to dendrochemistry of point-source contamination by adding analysis of inter-tree variability to analysis of central tendency. Fallon remains distinctive by a temporal increase in W beginning by the mid 1990s and by elevated Co since at least the early 1990s, as well as by high inter-tree variability for W and Co relative to comparison towns.","['Sheppard, Paul R', 'Helsel, Dennis R', 'Speakman, Robert J', 'Ridenour, Gary', 'Witten, Mark L']","['Sheppard PR', 'Helsel DR', 'Speakman RJ', 'Ridenour G', 'Witten ML']","['Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA. sheppard@ltrr.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111227,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', 'V9306CXO6G (Tungsten)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*analysis', 'Child', 'Cobalt/*analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Nevada/epidemiology', 'Oregon', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Trees/*chemistry', 'Tungsten/*analysis']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00347-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Apr 5;196(3):96-101. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.12.009.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 475 hospitalized patients who underwent BMBX in our medical center from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2010. We identified 75 patients who fulfilled the accepted classic Petersdorf criteria for FUO. All patients underwent in-hospital investigation for fever, including chest and abdominal computed tomography. RESULTS: In 20 patients (26.7%), BMBX established the final diagnosis. Sixteen patients had hematologic disorders, including 8 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2 with acute leukemia, 1 with multiple myeloma, 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome, and 4 with myeloproliferative disorders. The remaining patients with diagnostic BMBX specimens had solid tumors (2 patients), granulomatous disease (1 patient), and hemophagocytic syndrome (1 patient). Multivariate analysis revealed the following as the significant positive predictive parameters for a diagnostic BMBX specimen: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 7.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-45.45), clinical lymphadenopathy (OR, 21.98; 95% CI, 1.97-245.66), anemia (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.28-3.80), and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels (OR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.006). CONCLUSION: Bone marrow biopsy is still a useful ancillary procedure for establishing the diagnosis of FUO, particularly if used in the appropriate clinical setting. Clinical and laboratory parameters associated with hematologic disease are predictive of a diagnostic BMBX specimen in patients with FUO.","['Ben-Baruch, Sharon', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Braunstein, Rony', 'Perry, Chava', 'Ben-Ezra, Jonathan', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Herishanu, Yair']","['Ben-Baruch S', 'Canaani J', 'Braunstein R', 'Perry C', 'Ben-Ezra J', 'Polliack A', 'Naparstek E', 'Herishanu Y']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120109,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)00003-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Feb;87(2):136-42. doi: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.08.002.

To estimate the prevalence of malignancy in US male patients with haemophilia. We investigated the prevalence of malignancies among male patients with haemophilia using data from a six-state haemophilia surveillance project. Case patients with malignancies were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes abstracted from hospital records and death certificates during the surveillance period. Cancer prevalence rates were calculated for each year during the surveillance and compared with age- and race-specific prevalence rates among the U.S. male population obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. A total of 7 cases of leukaemia, 23 cases of lymphoma and 56 classifiable solid malignancies were identified among 3510 case patients during a total of 15,330 annual data abstraction collections. The rates of leukaemia, lymphoma and liver cancer among case patients were significantly higher than the rates among U.S. males as judged by prevalence ratios of 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-7.0] and 2.9 (95% CI =1.8-4.6), respectively. In contrast, the prevalence ratio of prostate cancer was lower than expected at 0.49 (95% CI = 0.31-0.77). Overall the prevalence of most cancers among case patients was similar to that of the U.S. male population. However, patients with haemophilia who have unexplained symptoms should be evaluated for malignancy.","['Dunn, A L', 'Austin, H', 'Soucie, J Michael']","['Dunn AL', 'Austin H', 'Soucie JM']","[""Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. amy.dunn@choa.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120108,England,Haemophilia,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,9442916,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hemophilia A/*epidemiology', 'Hemophilia B/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2516.2011.02731.x [doi]'],ppublish,Haemophilia. 2012 Jul;18(4):532-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2516.2011.02731.x.

Although this treatment can be curative, even in advanced disease, treatment failure is commonly manifested by relapse of disease, for which treatment is successful in only a minority of patients. There is a necessity for new strategies for prevention of posttransplantation relapse through early disease detection and intervention in order to improve patient outcomes. Detection of minimal residual disease in posttransplantation surveillance is felt to be a necessary component of any strategy. In chronic myeloid leukemia, assessment of the BCR-ABL1 load by quantitative real-time PCR provides an optimal guideline for posttransplantation therapeutic decisions, but in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, the situation is more complex because of the genetic heterogeneity of these disorders. Past strategies for relapse prevention have focused on use of donor lymphocyte infusions with variable success. Peritransplantation and maintenance therapies (eg, azacitidine) are under current investigation. This review summarizes the current status of minimal residual disease monitoring and prevention strategies for both pediatric and adult patients with myeloid malignancies in the transplantation setting and discusses perspectives for further improvement.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Talano, Julie-An', 'Bishop, Michael R']","['Bacher U', 'Talano JA', 'Bishop MR']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/mortality/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/01/18 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00452-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1 Suppl):S62-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.028.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

This has been coupled with technology development that has occurred at a remarkable pace. This review discusses the potential impact of this new technology on the field of blood and marrow stem cell transplantation. Hematologic malignancies have been among the forefront of those cancers whose genomes have been the subject of NGS. Hence, these studies have opened novel areas of biology that can be exploited for prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic means. Because of the unprecedented depth, resolution and accuracy achievable by NGS, this technology is well-suited for providing detailed information on the diversity of receptors that govern antigen recognition; this approach has the potential to contribute important insights into understanding the biologic effects of transplantation. Finally, the ability to perform comprehensive tumor sequencing provides a systematic approach to the discovery of genetic alterations that can encode peptides with restricted tumor expression, and hence serve as potential target antigens of graft-versus-leukemia responses. Altogether, this increasingly affordable technology will undoubtedly impact the future practice and care of patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Chapman, Michael', 'Warren, Edus H 3rd', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Chapman M', 'Warren EH 3rd', 'Wu CJ']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kinigdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods/trends']",2012/01/18 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00481-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1 Suppl):S151-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.011.,"['R01 CA155010-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI081860/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL103532/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704-37/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL103532-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA155010-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 DK089783/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3260465,,['NIHMS341631'],"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

These studies have led to identification of select CLL patient groups that generally have short survival dating from time of treatment or initial disease relapse who benefit from more aggressive therapeutic interventions. Allogeneic transplantation represents the only potentially curative option for CLL, but fully ablative regimens applied in the past have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity preparative regimens has made application of allogeneic transplant to CLL patients much more feasible and increased the number of patients proceeding to this modality. Arising from this has been establishment of guidelines where allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered in CLL. Introduction of new targeted therapies with less morbidity, which can produce durable remissions has the potential to redefine where transplantation is initiated in CLL. This review briefly summarizes the field of allogeneic stem cell transplant in CLL and the interface of new therapeutics with this modality.","['Jaglowski, Samantha M', 'Byrd, John C']","['Jaglowski SM', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/01/18 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00496-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1 Suppl):S132-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.018.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

If ichthyosis regresses under treatment for the haematological disorder, its recurrence reflects a turning point in the course of the disease and implies worsening of the prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were examined at a joint dermatology/haematology consultation. The diagnosis of ichthyosis was based on clinical examination alone with no patients undergoing skin biopsy. RESULTS: Our series included three men and two women aged 38 to 65 years consulting for a variety of reasons including asthenia, anaemia and adenopathy. Ichthyosis occurred 2 to 9 months after the initial symptoms of the blood disease. Lesions consisted of diffuse brown scales. The disease was associated with lymphadenopathy and biological inflammatory syndrome. Two patients were presenting non-Hodgkin lymphoma, one had Hodgkin's disease, one had chronic myeloid leukaemia in progression and one had an undifferentiated lymphomatous process. Treatment was based on chemotherapy and emollients. The ichthyosis progressed in step with the underlying malignancy in all cases, with regression being complete in three cases, partial in one case and absent in one case. DISCUSSION: In rare cases, acquired ichthyosis reveals systemic disease, and may be of infectious, endocrine or drug origin; it may also be idiopathic. However, it is most often a paraneoplastic syndrome with cutaneous expression encountered during haematological malignancies. Because of the variety of causative blood dyscrasias, ichthyosis cannot be used to guide their diagnosis, although it remains a reliable monitoring tool. CONCLUSION: Acquired ichthyosis should prompt the clinician to search for a neoplastic condition, primarily a haematological disorder, guided by other associated signs, given that in our study, skin lesions generally appear to precede signs of the blood disease.","['Berrady, R', 'Baybay, H', 'Khammar, Z', 'Lahlou, M', 'Lamchachti, L', 'Gallouj, S', 'El Hatimi, A', 'Mernissi, F-Z', 'Bono, W']","['Berrady R', 'Baybay H', 'Khammar Z', 'Lahlou M', 'Lamchachti L', 'Gallouj S', 'El Hatimi A', 'Mernissi FZ', 'Bono W']","['Service de medecine interne, CHU Hassan II, Fes, Maroc. rhizberr@yahoo.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20111203,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'Acquired ichthyosis', 'BEACOPP protocol', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Ichthyosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Parotid Neoplasms/complications', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Schizophrenia/complications', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/10 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(11)01006-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2011.10.394 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2012 Jan;139(1):9-14. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2011.10.394.

In addition, microRNAs have been demonstrated as key drivers of many malignancies and can function as either tumour suppressors or oncogenes. The haematopoietic system is not outside the realm of microRNA control with microRNAs controlling aspects of stem cell and progenitor self-renewal and differentiation, with many, if not all, haematological disorders associated with aberrant microRNA expression and function. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of microRNA control of haematopoiesis and detail the evidence for the contribution and clinical relevance of aberrant microRNA function to the characteristic block of differentiation in acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Palma, Catalina A', 'Tonna, Elise J', 'Ma, David F', 'Lutherborrow, Mark A']","['Palma CA', 'Tonna EJ', 'Ma DF', 'Lutherborrow MA']","[""Blood, Stem Cells and Cancer Research, St Vincent's Hospital Centre for Applied Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia. c.palma@amr.org.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism/*physiology', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01514.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2012 May;16(5):978-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01514.x.,,PMC4365878,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aimed to test whether NOTCH1 mutations and additional molecular abnormalities would impact T-ALL outcome in a series of 138 T-ALL paediatric cases. METHODS: T-ALL subtypes, status of SIL-TAL1 fusion, ectopic expression of TLX3, and mutations in FBXW7, KRAS, PTEN and NOTCH1 were assessed as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) prognostic factors. OS and EFS were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutations were 43.5% for NOTCH1, while FBXW7, KRAS and PTEN exhibited frequencies of 19.1%, 9.5% and 9.4%, respectively. In 78.3% of cases, the coexistence of NOTCH1 mutations and other molecular alterations was observed. In multivariate analysis no statistical association was revealed between NOTCH1 mutations and any other variable analyzed. The mean length of the follow-up was 68.4 months and the OS was 50.7%. SIL-TAL1 was identified as an adverse prognostic factor. NOTCH1 mutation status was not associated with outcome, while the presence of NOTCH1 complex mutations (indels) were associated with a longer overall survival (p = 0.031) than point mutations. CONCLUSION: NOTCH1 mutations alone or in combination with FBXW7 did not impact T-ALL prognosis. Nevertheless, complex NOTCH1 mutations appear to have a positive impact on OS and the SIL-TAL1 fusion was validated as a negative prognostic marker in our series of T-ALL.","['Mansur, Marcela Braga', 'Hassan, Rocio', 'Barbosa, Thayana C', 'Splendore, Alessandra', 'Jotta, Patricia Y', 'Yunes, Jose Andres', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Mansur MB', 'Hassan R', 'Barbosa TC', 'Splendore A', 'Jotta PY', 'Yunes JA', 'Wiemels JL', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120106,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Jan 6;12:9. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-9.,,PMC3305583,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analysed 298 MBL patients by multi-parameter flow cytometry, chromosome banding analysis (CBA)/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and IGHV mutation status and compared them with 356 CLL patients. In MBL, CBA more frequently revealed a normal karyotype and FISH identified less frequently del(6q), del(13q) (as sole alterations), and del(17)(p13).

Higher CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, del(11)(q22.3) (FISH), trisomy 12 (FISH), and 14q32/IGH-translocations (CBA) were correlated with a shorter TTT in the combined cohort (MBL + CLL); a sole del(13)(q14) (FISH) correlated with longer TTT. Regarding overall survival, unmutated IGHV status and 'other' alterations (CBA) had an adverse impact. There was no correlation between the concentration of CLL-cells and TTT or overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed a negative impact on TTT for del(11)(q22.3)/ATM, trisomy 12 (both by FISH), and 14q32/IGH-translocations by CBA.

A retrospective study was done to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IM in treating chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in Trinidad and Tobago. METHODS: Patients in all phases of CML who started IM therapy between February 2001 and February 2004 were included. All had received other previous therapy. They were assessed for haematological, cytogenetic and molecular response, overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and adverse effects (AE). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were followed-up for a median 61 months. At initiation of IM, 18 were in the chronic phase (CP), 3 in accelerated phase (AP), 3 in blast crisis (BC) and one in myelofibrotic transformation (MF). Overall, 96% of patients achieved complete haematological remission (CHR). Among CP patients, 67% attained a major cytogenetic response (MCR) and 44% a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). Overall survival and event free survival in the CP group were 82% and 76% respectively. Overall survival for advanced phase patients was 14% at 61 months. The adverse effects of IM were the same as previously described and generally tolerable. No patient opted to discontinue IM because of side effects. CONCLUSION: After 5 years of follow-up, IM was found to induce favourable and durable survival responses with an acceptable side effect profile in CP-CML patients who had received prior treatment with alternative agents.","['Charles, K S', 'Ramon, L', 'Leelah, N', 'Oluwabusi, T A A', 'Seemungal, T']","['Charles KS', 'Ramon L', 'Leelah N', 'Oluwabusi TA', 'Seemungal T']","['Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago. skcharles@live.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Jamaica,West Indian Med J,The West Indian medical journal,0417410,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trinidad and Tobago', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2012/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['1544 [pii]'],ppublish,West Indian Med J. 2011 Jun;60(3):298-302.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review underscores the effects of these environmental factors on maternal and children's health, as the most vulnerable groups to climate change and air pollution. METHODS: We reviewed electronic databases for a search of the literature to find relevant studies published in English from 1990 to 2011. RESULTS: Environmental factors, notably climate change and air pollution influence children's health before conception and continue during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Experts have suggested that such health hazards may represent the greatest public health challenge that humanity has faced. The accumulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, primarily from burning fossil fuels, results in warming which has an impact on air pollution particularly on levels of ozone and particulates. Heat-related health effects include increased rates of pregnancy complications, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, low birth weight, renal effects, vector-borne diseases as malaria and dengue, increased diarrheal and respiratory disease, food insecurity, decreased quality of foods (notably grains), malnutrition, water scarcity, exposures to toxic chemicals, worsened poverty, natural disasters and population displacement. Air pollution has many adverse health effects for mothers and children. In addition to short-term effects like premature labour, intrauterine growth retardation, neonatal and infant mortality rate, malignancies (notably leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphoma), respiratory diseases, allergic disorders and anaemia, exposure to criteria air pollutants from early life might be associated with increase in stress oxidative, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction which in turn might have long-term effects on chronic non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals have an exclusive capability to help prevent and reduce the harmful effects of environmental factors for high-risk groups, and should consider this capacity in their usual practice.","['Poursafa, Parinaz', 'Kelishadi, Roya']","['Poursafa P', 'Kelishadi R']","['MSc of Environmental engineering, Department of Environmental Protection, Environment Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,Iranian journal of nursing and midwifery research,101558775,,,,2012/01/10 06:00,2012/01/10 06:01,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res. 2011 Summer;16(3):257-64.,,PMC3249808,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Climate change', 'air pollution', 'children', 'health', 'health professionals', 'pregnant mothers', 'prevention']",,,,,,,,,

An important clinical problem is the cases labeled as fever of unknown origin (FUO), which often evade diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to find the cause of FUO in a tertiary care hospital of eastern India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of inpatients, with regard to both clinical signs and investigations. RESULTS: The main diagnosis in the end was tuberculosis, closely followed by hematological malignancy. A substantial number of cases remained undiagnosed despite all investigations. The provisional diagnosis matched with the final in around two thirds of the cases. While for younger patients leukemia was a significant diagnosis, for older ones, extra-pulmonary tuberculosis was a main concern. INTERPRETATION: In India, infectious disease still remains the most important cause of fever. Thus the initial investigations should always include tests for that purpose in a case of FUO. CONCLUSION: Geographic variations and local infection profiles should always be considered when investigating a case of FUO. However, some of the cases always elude diagnosis, although the patients may respond to empirical therapy.","['Bandyopadhyay, Dipanjan', 'Bandyopadhyay, Ramtanu', 'Paul, Rudrajit', 'Roy, Deeptarka']","['Bandyopadhyay D', 'Bandyopadhyay R', 'Paul R', 'Roy D']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College Kolkata, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Glob Infect Dis,Journal of global infectious diseases,101521436,,,,2012/01/10 06:00,2012/01/10 06:01,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-777X.91052 [doi]', 'JGID-3-329 [pii]']",ppublish,J Glob Infect Dis. 2011 Oct;3(4):329-33. doi: 10.4103/0974-777X.91052.,,PMC3249985,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FUO', 'Infectious disease', 'Malignancy']",,,,,,,,,

Experts of the European LeukemiaNet and NCCN have indicated what degrees of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses should be expected at definite time points for patients with CML to have the highest probability of experiencing the final optimal response, defined as the achievement of at least a complete hematologic response with a minor cytogenetic response after 3 months; at least a partial cytogenetic response after 6 months; at least a CCyR after 12 months; and a major molecular response after 18 months of therapy. The last opportunity for a CCyR has been established at 18 months. Because the residual probability of attaining a CCyR is reduced for patients who do not experience a complete hematologic response by 3 months, any cytogenetic response by 6 months, or a major cytogenetic response by 12 months, these conditions are considered treatment failures. At this point, a change in therapy is highly recommended, such as second-line treatment with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib or dasatinib and, in specific situations, a stem cell transplant. The loss of any grade of previously achieved cytogenetic response at any time point is also considered an imatinib failure demanding a change of therapy. Finally, intermediate gradations of response exist between optimal response and failure in which, although not totally compromised, the possibilities of achieving an optimal response later are decreased. The best therapeutic strategies to be followed in these intermediate situations, called suboptimal responses, have not been clearly established and are still under clinical investigation, but for the moment, a change of therapy is not required.","['Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Fava, Carmen']","['Saglio G', 'Fava C']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital, Turin, Italy. giuseppe.saglio@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10/1/121 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2012.0011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2012 Jan;10(1):121-9. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2012.0011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib was the first TKI approved to treat CML in the chronic phase. After their initial approval as second-line agents, dasatinib and nilotinib were compared with imatinib in the first-line setting in 2 randomized trials. Both trials showed that therapeutic milestones (complete cytogenetic remission and major molecular remission) occurred earlier with these newer agents, leading to their approval for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML. Therefore, 3 different TKIs are now available for treating CML. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with imatinib shows that the attainment of therapeutic milestones by 12 months of therapy leads to better long-term outcomes. Most patients who experience disease progression on imatinib do so within the first 3 years of therapy. Therefore, one can argue that dasatinib or nilotinib should be chosen to treat patients with newly diagnosed CML. However, these agents do not have the long-term track record of imatinib.

It influences stem cell fate, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in responsive tissues. In adult organisms, hedgehog pathway activity is required for aspects of tissue maintenance and regeneration; however, there is increasing awareness that abnormal hedgehog signaling is associated with malignancy. Hedgehog signaling is critical for early hematopoietic development, but there is controversy over its role in normal hematopoiesis in adult organisms where it may be dispensable. Conversely, hedgehog signaling appears to be an important survival and proliferation signal for a spectrum of hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, hedgehog signaling may be critical for the maintenance and expansion of leukemic stem cells and therefore provides a possible mechanism to selectively target these primitive cell subpopulations, which are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Indeed, phase 1 clinical trials of hedgehog pathway inhibitors are currently underway to test this hypothesis in myeloid leukemias. This review covers: (1) the hedgehog pathway and its role in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, (2) the recent development of clinical grade small molecule inhibitors of the pathway, and (3) the potential utility of hedgehog pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in hemato-oncology.","['Irvine, David A', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Irvine DA', 'Copland M']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120105,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45964-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-383752 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 8;119(10):2196-204. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-383752.

The RUNX1-ETO fusion protein that is expressed by this translocation is poorly leukemogenic and requires additional mutations for transformation. Loss of sex chromosome (LOS) is frequently observed in t(8;21) AML. In the present study, to evaluate whether LOS cooperates with t(8;21) in leukemogenesis, we first used a retroviral transduction/transplantation model to express RUNX1-ETO in hematopoietic cells from XO mice. The low frequency of leukemia in these mice suggests that the potentially critical gene for suppression of t(8;21) leukemia in humans is not conserved on mouse sex chromosomes. The gene encoding the GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit (CSF2RA) is located on X and Y chromosomes in humans but on chromosome 19 in mice. GM-CSF promotes myeloid cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. To determine whether GM-CSF signaling affects RUNX1-ETO leukemogenesis, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that lack GM-CSF signaling were used to express RUNX1-ETO and transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, and a high penetrance of AML was observed in recipients. Furthermore, GM-CSF reduced the replating ability of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells. These results suggest a possible tumor-suppressor role of GM-CSF in RUNX1-ETO leukemia. Loss of the CSF2RA gene may be a critical mutation explaining the high incidence of LOS associated with the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation.","['Matsuura, Shinobu', 'Yan, Ming', 'Lo, Miao-Chia', 'Ahn, Eun-Young', 'Weng, Stephanie', 'Dangoor, David', 'Matin, Mahan', 'Higashi, Tsunehito', 'Feng, Gen-Sheng', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Matsuura S', 'Yan M', 'Lo MC', 'Ahn EY', 'Weng S', 'Dangoor D', 'Matin M', 'Higashi T', 'Feng GS', 'Zhang DE']","['Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120105,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Csf2ra protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MTG8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Sex Chromosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49186-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-350694 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 29;119(13):3155-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-350694.

Recently, a direct involvement of gammac in self-sufficient growth in a concentration-dependent manner was described, implying a direct relationship between the amount of the molecule and its role in cell cycle progression. In this study, we evaluate whether gammac expression could interfere in cell cycle progression also in malignant hematopoietic cells. Here, we first report that in the absence of gammac expression, lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (BCLs) die at a higher extent than control cells. This phenomenon is caspase-3 independent and is associated to a decreased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. By contrast, increased expression of gammac protein directly correlates with spontaneous cell growth in several malignant hematopoietic cell lines. We, also, find that the knockdown of gammac protein through short interfering RNA is able to decrease the cell proliferation rate in these malignancies. Furthermore, an increased expression of all D-type cyclins is found in proliferating neoplastic cells. In addition, a direct correlation between the amount of gammac and cyclins A2 and B1 expression is found. Hence, our data demonstrate that the amount of the gammac is able to influence the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression, thus being directly involved in the regulatory control of cell proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Vigliano, Ilaria', 'Palamaro, Loredana', 'Bianchino, Gabriella', 'Fusco, Anna', 'Vitiello, Laura', 'Grieco, Vitina', 'Romano, Rosa', 'Salvatore, Marco', 'Pignata, Claudio']","['Vigliano I', 'Palamaro L', 'Bianchino G', 'Fusco A', 'Vitiello L', 'Grieco V', 'Romano R', 'Salvatore M', 'Pignata C']","['Department of Pediatrics, ""Federico II"" University, Naples 80131, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120105,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (IL2RG protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['dxr114 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxr114 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2012 Mar;24(3):159-67. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxr114.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Creatinine transport was studied in transfected HEK293 cells in vitro and in wild-type mice and age-matched organic cation transporter 1 and 2-deficient [Oct1/2(-/-)] mice ex vivo and in vivo. Clinical pharmacogenetic and transport inhibition studies were done in two separate cohorts of cancer patients. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type mice, creatinine clearance was significantly impaired in Oct1/2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, creatinine inhibited organic cation transport in freshly isolated proximal tubules from wild-type mice and humans, but not in those from Oct1/2(-/-) mice. In a genetic association analysis (n = 590), several polymorphisms around the OCT2/SLC22A2 gene locus, including rs2504954 (P = 0.000873), were significantly associated with age-adjusted creatinine levels. Furthermore, in cancer patients (n = 68), the OCT2 substrate cisplatin caused an acute elevation of serum creatinine (P = 0.0083), consistent with inhibition of an elimination pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study shows that OCT2 plays a decisive role in the renal secretion of creatinine. This process can be inhibited by OCT2 substrates, which impair the usefulness of creatinine as a marker of renal function.","['Ciarimboli, Giuliano', 'Lancaster, Cynthia S', 'Schlatter, Eberhard', 'Franke, Ryan M', 'Sprowl, Jason A', 'Pavenstadt, Hermann', 'Massmann, Vivian', 'Guckel, Denise', 'Mathijssen, Ron H J', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Herrmann, Edwin', 'Sparreboom, Alex']","['Ciarimboli G', 'Lancaster CS', 'Schlatter E', 'Franke RM', 'Sprowl JA', 'Pavenstadt H', 'Massmann V', 'Guckel D', 'Mathijssen RH', 'Yang W', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Herrmann E', 'Sparreboom A']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik D, Experimentelle Nephrologie, and Klinik und Poliklinik fur Urologie, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120105,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 2)', '0 (SLC22A2 protein, human)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Creatinine/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 2', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2503 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2503 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Feb 15;18(4):1101-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2503.

Recently, more and more data has shown that Runx2 regulates hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific type X collagen gene (Col10a1) expression in different species. However, how Runx2 regulation of Col10a1 expression impacts chondrocyte maturation, an essential step of endochondral bone formation, remains unknown. We have recently generated transgenic mice in which Flag-tagged Runx2 was driven by a cell-specific Col10a1 control element. Significantly increased level of Runx2 and Col10a1 mRNA transcripts were detected in transgenic mouse limbs at both E17.5 (embryonic day 17.5) and P1 (post-natal day1) stages, suggesting an in vivo correlation of Runx2 and Col10a1 expression. Surprisingly, skeletal staining suggested delayed ossification in both the axial and the appendicular skeleton of transgenic mice from E14.5 until P6. Histological analysis showed elongated hypertrophic zones in transgenic mice, with less von Kossa and TUNEL staining in long bone sections at both E17.5 and P1 stages, suggesting defective mineralization due to delayed chondrocyte maturation or apoptosis. Indeed, we detected increased level of anti-apoptotic genes B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, Osteopontin, and Sox9 in transgenic mice by real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis also suggested increased Sox9 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes of transgenic mice. Together, our data suggest that targeting Runx2 in hypertrophic chondrocytes upregulates expression of Col10a1 and other marker genes (such as Sox9). This will change the local matrix environment, delay chondrocyte maturation, reduce apoptosis and matrix mineralization, and eventually, lead to impaired endochondral ossification.","['Ding, Ming', 'Lu, Yaojuan', 'Abbassi, Sam', 'Li, Feifei', 'Li, Xin', 'Song, Yu', 'Geoffroy, Valerie', 'Im, Hee-Jeong', 'Zheng, Qiping']","['Ding M', 'Lu Y', 'Abbassi S', 'Li F', 'Li X', 'Song Y', 'Geoffroy V', 'Im HJ', 'Zheng Q']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Col10a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type X)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOX9 Transcription Factor)', '0 (SOX9 protein, human)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone and Bones/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type X/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Osteogenesis/*physiology', 'Osteopontin/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Skeleton', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24045 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Oct;227(10):3446-56. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24045.,"['R03 DE16041/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DE016041-01/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DE016041/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX002647/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R03 DE016041-02/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3359397,,['NIHMS346564'],"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nationwide Geocap case-control study included the 2,753 cases diagnosed in mainland France over 2002-2007 and 30,000 contemporaneous population controls. The last addresses were geocoded and located around the 19 NPPs. The study used distance to NPPs and a dose-based geographic zoning (DBGZ), based on the estimated dose to bone marrow related to NPP gaseous discharges. An odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 [1.0-3.3], based on 14 cases, was evidenced for children living within 5 km of NPPs compared to those living 20 km or further away, and a very similar association was observed in the concomitant incidence study (standardized incidence ratio (SIR)=1.9 [1.0-3.2]). These results were similar for all the 5-year-age groups. They persisted after stratification for several contextual characteristics of the municipalities of residence. Conversely, using the DBGZ resulted in OR and SIR close to one in all of the dose categories. There was no increase in AL incidence over 1990-2001 and over the entire 1990-2007 period. The results suggest a possible excess risk of AL in the close vicinity of French NPPs in 2002-2007. The absence of any association with the DBGZ may indicate that the association is not explained by NPP gaseous discharges. Overall, the findings call for investigation for potential risk factors related to the vicinity of NPP and collaborative analysis of multisite studies conducted in various countries.","['Sermage-Faure, Claire', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Chartier, Michel', 'Guyot-Goubin, Aurelie', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Sermage-Faure C', 'Laurier D', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Chartier M', 'Guyot-Goubin A', 'Rudant J', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM U1018, CESP Center for research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer Team, Villejuif F-94807, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120228,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Power Plants', 'Prognosis', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27425 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Sep 1;131(5):E769-80. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27425.

Three immunoglobulin (IG) heavy variable (IGHV) genes accounted for 45.8% of the cases (IGHV1-2, 24.9%; IGHV4-34, 12.8%; IGHV3-23, 8.1%). Particularly for the IGHV1-2 gene, strong biases were evident regarding utilization of different alleles, with 79/86 rearrangements (92%) using allele (*)04. Among cases more stringently classified as splenic marginal-zone lymphoma (SMZL) thanks to the availability of splenic histopathological specimens, the frequency of IGHV1-2(*)04 peaked at 31%. The IGHV1-2(*)04 rearrangements carried significantly longer complementarity-determining region-3 (CDR3) than all other cases and showed biased IGHD gene usage, leading to CDR3s with common motifs. The great majority of analyzed rearrangements (299/345, 86.7%) carried IGHV genes with some impact of somatic hypermutation, from minimal to pronounced. Noticeably, 75/79 (95%) IGHV1-2(*)04 rearrangements were mutated; however, they mostly (56/75 cases; 74.6%) carried few mutations (97-99.9% germline identity) of conservative nature and restricted distribution. These distinctive features of the IG receptors indicate selection by (super)antigenic element(s) in the pathogenesis of SMZL. Furthermore, they raise the possibility that certain SMZL subtypes could derive from progenitor populations adapted to particular antigenic challenges through selection of VH domain specificities, in particular the IGHV1-2(*)04 allele.","['Bikos, V', 'Darzentas, N', 'Hadzidimitriou, A', 'Davis, Z', 'Hockley, S', 'Traverse-Glehen, A', 'Algara, P', 'Santoro, A', 'Gonzalez, D', 'Mollejo, M', 'Dagklis, A', 'Gangemi, F', 'Bosler, D S', 'Bourikas, G', 'Anagnostopoulos, A', 'Tsaftaris, A', 'Iannitto, E', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Felman, P', 'Berger, F', 'Belessi, C', 'Ghia, P', 'Papadaki, T', 'Dogan, A', 'Degano, M', 'Matutes, E', 'Piris, M A', 'Oscier, D', 'Stamatopoulos, K']","['Bikos V', 'Darzentas N', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Davis Z', 'Hockley S', 'Traverse-Glehen A', 'Algara P', 'Santoro A', 'Gonzalez D', 'Mollejo M', 'Dagklis A', 'Gangemi F', 'Bosler DS', 'Bourikas G', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Tsaftaris A', 'Iannitto E', 'Ponzoni M', 'Felman P', 'Berger F', 'Belessi C', 'Ghia P', 'Papadaki T', 'Dogan A', 'Degano M', 'Matutes E', 'Piris MA', 'Oscier D', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120106,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20123 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1638-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.3.

Unfortunately, the standard therapeutic agents used for this disease have high toxicities and poor efficacy. The one exception to these poor outcomes is the use of the retinoid, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), for a rare subtype of AML (APL). The use of the differentiation agent, ATRA, in combination with low-dose chemotherapy leads to the long-term survival and presumed cure of 75-85% of patients. Unfortunately ATRA has not been clinically useful for other subtypes of AML. Though many non-APL leukemic cells respond to ATRA, they require significantly higher concentrations of ATRA for effective differentiation. Here we show that the combination of ATRA with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition significantly enhances ATRA-mediated AML differentiation and growth inhibition. These studies have revealed that ATRA's receptor, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), is a novel target of GSK3 phosphorylation and that GSK3 can impact the expression and transcriptional activity of the RAR. Overall, our studies suggest the clinical potential of ATRA and GSK3 inhibition for AML and provide a mechanistic framework to explain the promising activity of this combination regimen.","['Gupta, K', 'Gulen, F', 'Sun, L', 'Aguilera, R', 'Chakrabarti, A', 'Kiselar, J', 'Agarwal, M K', 'Wald, D N']","['Gupta K', 'Gulen F', 'Sun L', 'Aguilera R', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Kiselar J', 'Agarwal MK', 'Wald DN']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120106,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20122 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1277-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.2.

They consist of a traditional NSAID to which an H(2)S-releasing moiety is covalently attached. We examined the effects of four different HS-NSAIDs on the growth properties of eleven different human cancer cell lines of six different tissue origins. Human colon, breast, pancreatic, prostate, lung, and leukemia cancer cell lines were treated with HS-aspirin, -sulindac, -iburofen, -naproxen, and their traditional counterparts. HS-NSAIDs inhibited the growth of all cancer cell lines studied, with potencies of 28- to >3000-fold greater than that of their traditional counterparts. HS-aspirin (HS-ASA) was consistently the most potent. HS-NSAIDs inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G(0)/G(1) cell cycle block. Metabolism of HS-ASA by colon cells showed that the acetyl group of ASA was hydrolyzed rapidly, followed by hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the salicylate anion to the H(2)S releasing moiety, producing salicylic acid and ADT-OH from which H(2)S is released. In reconstitution studies, ASA and ADT-OH were individually less active than the intact HS-ASA towards cell growth inhibition. Additionally, the combination of these two components representing a fairly close approximation to the intact HS-ASA, was 95-fold less active than the intact HS-ASA for growth inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HS-NSAIDs have potential anti-growth activity against a wide variety of human cancer cells.","['Chattopadhyay, Mitali', 'Kodela, Ravinder', 'Nath, Niharika', 'Dastagirzada, Yosef M', 'Velazquez-Martinez, Carlos A', 'Boring, Daniel', 'Kashfi, Khosrow']","['Chattopadhyay M', 'Kodela R', 'Nath N', 'Dastagirzada YM', 'Velazquez-Martinez CA', 'Boring D', 'Kashfi K']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, City University of New York Medical School, New York, NY 10031, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111226,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (2-(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)-propionic acid', '4-(5-thioxo-5H-(1,2)dithiol-3-yl)-phenyl ester)', '0 (4-(5-thioxo-5H-1,2-dithiol-3-yl)-phenyl 2-(4-isobutyphenyl)propanoate)', '0 (4-(5-thioxo-5H-1,2-dithiol-3-yl)-phenyl 2-acetoxybenzoate)', '0 (5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-((4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl)methylene)-1H-indene-3-acetic', 'acid 4-(5-thioxo-5H-1,2-dithiol-3-yl)-phenyl ester)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiones)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', '57Y76R9ATQ (Naproxen)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'WK2XYI10QM (Ibuprofen)', 'YY9FVM7NSN (Hydrogen Sulfide)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aspirin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Sulfide/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ibuprofen/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Naproxen/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiones/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00934-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Mar 15;83(6):715-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.018.

A previous report established a link between Lmo2 expression and the nuclear presence of oncogenic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. The oncogenic JAK2 kinase phosphorylates histone H3 on Tyr 41 that leads to the relief of Lmo2 promoter repression and subsequent gene expression. Similar to JAK2, constitutive activation of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) has been implicated in lymphoid malignancies. However, it is not known whether oncogenic Lck regulates Lmo2 expression through a similar mechanism. We show here that Lmo2 expression is significantly elevated in T cell leukemia LSTRA overexpressing active Lck kinase and in HEK 293 cells expressing oncogenic Y505FLck kinase. Nuclear localization of active Lck kinase was confirmed in both Lck-transformed cells by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy. More importantly, in contrast to oncogenic JAK2, oncogenic Lck kinase does not result in significant increase in histone H3 phosphorylation on Tyr 41. Instead, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment shows that oncogenic Y505FLck kinase binds to the Lmo2 promoter in vivo. This result raises the possibility that oncogenic Lck may activate Lmo2 promoter through direct interaction.","['Venkitachalam, Srividya', 'Chueh, Fu-Yu', 'Yu, Chao-Lan']","['Venkitachalam S', 'Chueh FY', 'Yu CL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, H.

Due to their low solubility, triterpenes (which are known to act on cancers), do not occur in aqueous extracts in significant amounts. Using cyclodextrins, we have found it possible to solubilize mistletoe triterpene acids and to determine their effects on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A C.B-17/SCID model of pre-B ALL (NALM-6) was used to test efficacy and mechanisms of treatment with lectin- and triterpene acid containing preparations in vivo. Cytotoxicity of increasing concentrations of V. album L. preparations was assessed in vitro. Apoptosis was determined using mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, annexin V/PI, western blot analyses and caspase inhibitor assays. RESULTS: Solubilized triterpene acid- or lectin-containing V. album L. extracts inhibited cell proliferation and demonstrated cytotoxic properties in vitro. Annexin V/PI and mitochondrial membrane potential assays indicated that dose-dependent induction of apoptosis was the main mechanism. Combination (viscumTT) of lectin- (viscum) and triterpene-containing (TT) extracts resulted in greatest induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase activity demonstrated that these extracts were able to induce apoptosis through both caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways. In vivo experimentation showed that treatment of mice with viscumTT combination prolonged mean survival to 50.5 days compared to 39.3 days in the phosphate-buffered saline group. CONCLUSION: Here for the first time, we have demonstrated that either solubilized triterpene acids or lectins and combinations thereof, induce dose-dependent apoptosis in the ALL cell line NALM-6 via caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways.","['Delebinski, C I', 'Jaeger, S', 'Kemnitz-Hassanin, K', 'Henze, G', 'Lode, H N', 'Seifert, G J']","['Delebinski CI', 'Jaeger S', 'Kemnitz-Hassanin K', 'Henze G', 'Lode HN', 'Seifert GJ']","['Department of Paediatrics, Division of Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120103,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/isolation & purification', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oleanolic Acid/administration & dosage', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/isolation & purification', 'Plant Lectins/administration & dosage/isolation & purification', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Solubility', 'Triterpenes/*administration & dosage/isolation & purification', 'Viscum album/*chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00801.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2012 Apr;45(2):176-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00801.x.

Thus, the availability of canine stem cells will greatly facilitate the use of the dog in the development of stem cell-based gene therapies and regenerative medicine. In this study we describe the production of canine induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs) from adult dermal fibroblasts. These cells have a morphology resembling previously described canine embryonic stem cells, a normal karyotype, and express pluripotency markers including alkaline phosphatase, Nanog, Oct4, Telomerase, SSEA1, SSEA4, TRA1-60, TRA1-81, and Rex1. Furthermore, the inactive X chromosome is reactivated indicating a ground-state pluripotency. In culture they readily form embryoid bodies, which in turn give rise to cell types from all 3 embryonic germ layers, as indicated by expression of the definitive endoderm markers Cxcr4 and alpha-fetoprotein, mesoderm markers Collagen IIA and Gata2, and ectoderm markers betaIII-tubulin, Enolase, and Nestin. Of particular significance is the observation that these ciPSCs are dependent only on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), making them similar to mouse and canine embryonic stem cells, but strikingly unlike the ciPSCs recently described in two other studies, which were dependent on both basic fibroblast growth factor and LIF in order to maintain their pluripotency. Thus, our ciPSCs closely resemble mouse ESCs derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos, while the previously described ciPSCs appear to be more representative of cells from the epiblast of mouse postimplantation embryos.","['Whitworth, Deanne J', 'Ovchinnikov, Dmitry A', 'Wolvetang, Ernst J']","['Whitworth DJ', 'Ovchinnikov DA', 'Wolvetang EJ']","['School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland, Gatton, Queensland, Australia. d.whitworth@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120215,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (leukocyte inhibitory factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Shape', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology/transplantation', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Teratoma/pathology', 'Transgenes', 'X Chromosome Inactivation']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0608 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 Aug 10;21(12):2288-97. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0608.

It was efficacious in a FLT3-ITD dependent myeloproliferative mouse model, doubling survival compared to other FLT3 inhibitors, with 25% of the mice cured.

Blood component transfusion to correct coagulopathy is the keystone in reducing bleeding. The benefit of fresh frozen plasma transfusion is unproven. Using laboratory profiles to predict bleeding is important guidance for the determination of transfusion policies in the treatment of APL. DESIGN AND METHODS: For 116 patients of APL, bleeding events were collected and correlated with various hematologic and coagulation parameters, including leukemic cell percentages, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen levels, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scores. RESULTS: Overt DIC occurred in 77.6% of patients. Severity of DIC was associated with bone marrow leukemic cell percentages but unrelated to bleeding. Patients with bleeding had significantly higher WBC counts (26.73 +/- 6.18 vs. 13.03 +/- 3.03 per muL, P = 0.026) and more prolonged PT (4.85 +/- 0.70 vs. 2.59 +/- 0.28 s, P = 0.002) and APTT (3.98 +/- 1.68 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.93 s, P = 0.017). Fibrinogen levels, platelet counts, and leukemia cell percentages were not significantly different between bleeding and non-bleeding patients. PT is valuable in prediction of bleeding. Patients with PT >== 5 s had a relative risk of 6.14 for bleeding. Seven patients had severe bleeding before initiation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APL are susceptible to DIC and subsequent bleeding events. Prompt ATRA administration is crucial in preventing hemorrhagic events. High WBC counts, prolonged PT, and APTT are associated with clinical bleeding in our series. PT is the most accurate parameter in predicting bleeding. Based on these findings, supportive care should be directed toward correction of coagulopathy to prevent bleeding complications and fresh frozen plasma appears to be indicated for coagulopathy associated with APL.","['Chang, Hung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Dunn, Po', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Wu, Jin-Hou', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Hung, Yu-Shin', 'Tang, Tzung-Chih']","['Chang H', 'Kuo MC', 'Shih LY', 'Dunn P', 'Wang PN', 'Wu JH', 'Lin TL', 'Hung YS', 'Tang TC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120202,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Databases, Factual', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/biosynthesis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Risk']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01747.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Apr;88(4):321-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01747.x.

A strong correlation between deletions of 17p13 and an accumulation of full-length p53 protein was found and was associated with a worse outcome compared to CLL with normal p53 (treatment-free survival p < 0.001, overall survival p = 0.04).

Taken together, the differential expression of p53 isoforms could disrupt the p53 response and contribute to CLL pathogenesis.","['Sellmann, Ludger', 'Carpinteiro, Alexander', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Scholtysik, Rene', 'Siemer, Dorte', 'Klein-Hipass, Ludger', 'Kube, Dieter', 'Durig, Jan', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Stanelle, Jens', 'Kuppers, Ralf']","['Sellmann L', 'Carpinteiro A', 'Nuckel H', 'Scholtysik R', 'Siemer D', 'Klein-Hipass L', 'Kube D', 'Durig J', 'Duhrsen U', 'Stanelle J', 'Kuppers R']","['Department of Hematology, Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. ludger.sellmann@uk-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120213,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.654115 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1282-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.654115.

BD is classified as a human carcinogen based on epidemiological evidence for an increased incidence of leukemia in workers occupationally exposed to BD and its potent carcinogenicity in laboratory mice. A diepoxide metabolite of BD, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), is considered the ultimate carcinogenic species of BD due to its ability to form genotoxic DNA-DNA cross-links. We have previously employed capillary HPLC-ESI(+)-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry) methods to quantify DEB-induced DNA-DNA conjugates, e.g. 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol (bis-N7G-BD), 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden-1-yl)-2,3-butanediol (N7G-N1A-BD), and 1,N(6)-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxypropan-1,3-diyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (1,N(6)-HMHP-dA), in tissues of laboratory mice exposed to 6.25-625 ppm BD (Goggin et al. Cancer Res. 2009, 69(6), 2479-2486). However, typical BD human exposure levels are 0.01 to 3.2 ppb in urban air and 1-2.0 ppm in an occupational setting, requiring greater detection sensitivity for these critical lesions. In the present study, a nanoHPLC-nanoESI(+)-MS/MS method was developed for ultrasensitive, accurate, and precise quantitation of bis-N7G-BD in tissues of laboratory mice treated with low ppm and subppm concentrations of BD. The LOD value of the new method is 0.5 fmol/100 mug DNA, and the LOQ is 1.0 fmol/100 mug DNA, making it possible to quantify bis-N7G-BD adducts present at concentrations of 3 per 10(9) nucleotides. Bis-N7G-BD adduct amounts in liver tissues of mice exposed to 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ppm BD for 2 weeks were 5.7 +/- 3.3, 9.2 +/- 1.5, and 18.6 +/- 6.9 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides, respectively, suggesting that bis-N7G-BD adduct formation is more efficient under low exposure conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of DEB specific DNA adducts following low ppm and subppm exposure to BD.","['Sangaraju, Dewakar', 'Goggin, Melissa', 'Walker, Vernon', 'Swenberg, James', 'Tretyakova, Natalia']","['Sangaraju D', 'Goggin M', 'Walker V', 'Swenberg J', 'Tretyakova N']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120126,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Butylene Glycols)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Butylene Glycols/*analysis', '*Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Adducts/*analysis', 'Environmental Pollutants/toxicity', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Liver/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Nanotechnology', '*Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2012/01/10 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/01/07 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac203079c [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2012 Feb 7;84(3):1732-9. doi: 10.1021/ac203079c.

APL typically presents with a life-threatening hemorrhagic diathesis. Before the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the cure of APL, fatal hemorrhages due, at least in part, to the APL-associated coagulopathy, were a major cause of induction remission failure. The laboratory abnormalities of blood coagulation found in these patients indicate the occurrence of a hypercoagulable state. Major determinants of the coagulopathy of APL are endogenous factors expressed by the leukemic cells, including procoagulant factors, fibrinolytic proteins, and non-specific proteolytic enzymes. In addition, these cells have an increased capacity to adhere to the vascular endothelium, and to secrete inflammatory cytokines [i.e. interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha)], which in turn stimulate the expression of prothrombotic activities by endothelial cells and leukocytes. ATRA can interfere with each of the principal hemostatic properties of the leukemic cell, thus reducing the APL cell procoagulant potential, in parallel to the induction of cellular differentiation. This effect occurs in vivo, in the bone marrow of APL patients receiving ATRA, and is associated with the improvement of the bleeding symptoms. Therapy with arsenic trioxide (ATO) also beneficially affects coagulation in APL. However, early deaths from bleeding still remain a major problem in APL and further research is required in this field. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of the APL-associated coagulopathy and will overview the therapeutic approaches for the management of this complication.","['Falanga, Anna', 'Russo, Laura', 'Tartari, Carmen J']","['Falanga A', 'Russo L', 'Tartari CJ']","['Division of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, Dept.

Evolving treatment regimens have improved survival outcomes for NHL patients. As a result of this improvement, secondary malignancies are becoming an important issue in NHL survivors. This review aims to report data on this topic previously published by our group, adding unpublished results from the Modena Cancer Registry (MCR). We recently performed four studies about secondary neoplasms in NHL survivors: two studies analysing the risk of secondary neoplasms in patients treated for indolent and aggressive NHL; a meta-analysis of 23 studies investigating the risk of secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN) after NHL treatment; and a still-unpublished study evaluating the incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) in patients treated for NHL (from the MCR database). The first two studies analysed 563 patients with indolent NHL and 1280 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) enrolled in the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL) trials. Results showed that the cumulative incidence of secondary tumours was 10.5% at 12 years for indolent NHL and 8.2% at 15 years for DLBCL. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that NHL patients experienced a 1.88-fold increased risk for SMN compared with the general population; the standardized incidence risk (SIR) for secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was 11.07. Based on data from the MCR from 2000 through 2008, we found that the SIR was 1.63 for developing a secondary malignancy after NHL, and 1.99 for developing secondary haematological malignancies. Regarding myelodysplastic syndrome and/or AML incidence, nine NHL patients developed t-MN with a higher risk than expected (SIR 8.8, 95% CI: 4.0-16.6). In conclusion, patients treated for NHL are at increased risk of developing SMN. Regarding t-MN, data from the meta-analysis and the MCR demonstrate an excessive risk of developing AML (SIR 11.07 and 5.7, respectively) compared with solid SMN after treatment for NHL. Thus long-term monitoring should be considered for NHL survivors.","['Bari, Alessia', 'Marcheselli, Luigi', 'Marcheselli, Raffaella', 'Liardo, Eliana Valentina', 'Pozzi, Samantha', 'Ferri, Paola', 'Sacchi, Stefano']","['Bari A', 'Marcheselli L', 'Marcheselli R', 'Liardo EV', 'Pozzi S', 'Ferri P', 'Sacchi S']","['Program of Innovative Therapy in Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111220,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2012/01/06 06:00,2012/01/06 06:01,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.065 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011065 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011065. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.065.

At present the combination of arsenic trioxide plus ATRA should be considered for patients who are not candidates for anthracycline-based therapy. For pediatric and adult patients with APL aged < 60 years who achieve a CR with induction, I recommend 3 intensive courses of consolidation chemotherapy associated to ATRA, targeted on the basis of the risk group at diagnosis. In patients treated with a very intensive consolidation chemotherapy maintenance treatment can be omitted. However If a maintenance treatment has to be adopted I suggest the use of intermittent ATRA for 15 days every 3 months for a period of 2 years, rather than ATRA associated to chemotherapy. Moreover, taking into account the medical literature, a reduced dosage of ATRA ( 25 mg/m(2)) in pediatric patients and a consolidation chemotherapy of reduced intensity in elderly patients is recommended. Furthermore, in order to maximize survival, careful attention should be reserved to the coagulopathy and to the appearance of the differentiation syndrome. Finally, PCR for the PML/RARA fusion gene on a bone marrow specimen every three months for two years, and then every six months for additional three years are needed during the follow-up.","['Avvisati, Giuseppe']",['Avvisati G'],"['Unita Operativa Complessa di Ematologia, Trapianto di cellule staminali, Medicina trasfusionale e Terapia cellulare.

The median age at presentation was 29 years. Bleeding was the most common presenting symptom (79%). Most patients had an intermediate risk Sanz score (49%) and 34% had a high risk score. The median follow-up time was 36 months. All evaluable patients were treated for induction with the simultaneous administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and an anthracycline. The original AIDA treatment protocol was modified due to resource limitations at the NCI-Cairo by replacing of idarubicin with daunorubicin or doxorubicin in most of the cases and the inclusion of cytarabine during the consolidation phase only in pediatric patients. All patients who achieved molecular complete remission after consolidation received two-year maintenance treatment with low dose chemotherapy composed of 6 mercaptopurine, methotrexate and intermittent ATRA courses. Five patients died before treatment initiation due to bleeding, three died during induction chemotherapy due to infectious complications (n=2) and bleeding (n=1) and one patient died during consolidation therapy due to infection. The main therapeutic complications during the induction phase were febrile neutropenia (42%), bleeding (18%) and differentiation syndrome (11%).

The differentiation of leukemic blasts and promyelocytes induced by ATRA and/or ATO may lead to cellular migration, endothelial activation, and release of interleukins and vascular factors responsible of tissue damage. Roughly one quarter of patients with APL undergoing induction therapy will develop the DS, characterized by unexplained fever, acute respiratory distress with interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, and/or a vascular capillary leak syndrome leading to acute renal failure. Although the development of the DS, particularly of the severe form, is still associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality during induction, the early administration of high-dose dexamethasone at the onset of the first symptoms seems likely to have dramatically reduced the mortality rate of this complication.

Use of single agent ATO in the treatment of APL leads to remissions which are durable in the majority. ATO is probably the most effective single agent in the treatment of APL and there have been very few reports of primary resistance. It has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other conventional drugs to treat APL. Use of ATO is the accepted standard of care in the management of relapsed APL, where it is often used effectively as a bridge to a stem cell transplant. However, its role in newly diagnosed APL remains controversial. ATO probably has multiple mechanisms of action. Better understanding of its mechanisms of action/s is likely to lead to more rationale use of this agent or its derivatives either alone or in combination with other drugs. There is limited data on the kinetics of leukemia clearance and normal haematopoietic recovery after the administration of single agent ATO for the treatment of APL, preliminary data suggests that it is likely to be different from conventional therapy. There have been a number of concerns of the potential short and long term toxicity of this agent. Most such concerns arise from the toxicity profile noted in people exposed to long term arsenic exposure in the environment. With the therapeutic doses and schedules of administration of ATO in the treatment of malignancies the overall toxicity profile has been favorable. In a resource constrained environments the use of a single agent ATO based regimen is a realistic and acceptable option to treat almost all patients. In the developed world it has the potential in combination with other agents to improve the clinical outcome with reduction of dose intensity of chemotherapy and remains an option for patients who would not tolerate conventional therapy. In this review we focus on the use of single agent ATO for the treatment of APL and summarize our experience and review the literature.","['Mathews, Vikram', 'Chendamarai, Ezhilarasi', 'George, Biju', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Srivastava, Alok']","['Mathews V', 'Chendamarai E', 'George B', 'Viswabandya A', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111128,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2012/01/06 06:00,2012/01/06 06:01,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.056 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011056 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011056. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.056.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the frequency of NRAS (NRAS(mutant)) mutation; and its prognostic significance in Egyptian children with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). SUBJECT AND METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) samples were taken from 39 de novo pediatric AML patients. Twenty subjects with matched age and sex were selected as a control group. Samples from patients and control were analyzed for Exons 1, 2 of NRAS gene using genomic PCR-SSCP method. RESULTS: NRAS mutations at the time of diagnosis was found in 6/39 (15.4%) AML cases. Patients with NRAS(mutant) had no significant improved clinical outcome than patients without mutation. Patients with NRAS(mutant) had similar complete remission (CR) rates compared with non-mutated patients (66.7% vs. 69.5%, P=0.43). Those in CR had a similar relapse rate regardless of the presence of NRAS(mutant) (RR 33.4% vs. 30.2%, P=0.26). However, an adverse prognosis for 3 year overall survival (OS) was associated with the presence of NRAS mutations. This adverse prognosis associated with NRAS mutations was also observed in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.007). Univariate analysis showed that unfavorable prognostic factors for DFS were cytogenetic data (P = 0.005) and the NRAS gene mutation (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: NRAS(mutant) did not contribute to increase the disease recurrence, however NRAS(mutant) was found to be a poor prognostic factor for children with AML. Further studies to confirm these findings are required because of the small number of patients with NRAS mutation.","['Aly, Rabab M', 'El-Sharnoby, Mohamed R', 'Hagag, Adel A']","['Aly RM', 'El-Sharnoby MR', 'Hagag AA']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111128,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2012/01/06 06:00,2012/01/06 06:01,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.055 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011055 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011055. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.055.

In AML, older age is one of the strongest independent adverse prognostic factor, associated with decreased complete response rate, worse disease-free and overall survival, with highest rates of treatment related mortality, resistant disease and relapse, compared to younger patients. Outcomes are compromised in older patients not only by increased comorbidities and susceptibility to toxicity from therapy, but it is now recognized that elderly AML has peculiar biologic characteristics with a negative impact on treatment response.In older individuals prolonged exposure to environmental carcinogens may be the basis for similarities to therapy-related myeloid malignancies (t-MN), which result from toxic effects of previous cytotoxic treatments on hematopoietic stem cells. Age is itself a risk factor for t-MN, which are more frequent in elderly patients, where also a shorter latency between treatment of primary tumor and t-MN has been reported. t-MN following chemotherapy with alkylating agents and elderly AML frequently present MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities, including complex or monosomal karyotype, and a myelodysplastic phase preceding the diagnosis of overt leukemia. Similarly, t-MN and elderly-AML share common molecular abnormalities, such as reduced frequency of NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA mutations and increased MDR1 expression.Given the unfavorable prognosis of elderly and t-MN and the similar clinical and molecular aspects, this is a promising field for implementation of new treatment protocols including alternative biological drugs.","[""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Fabiani, Emiliano', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Greco, Mariangela', 'Guidi, Francesco', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Voso, Maria Teresa']","[""D'Alo F"", 'Fianchi L', 'Fabiani E', 'Criscuolo M', 'Greco M', 'Guidi F', 'Pagano L', 'Leone G', 'Voso MT']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111128,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2012/01/06 06:00,2012/01/06 06:01,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.052 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011052 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011052. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.052.

These discoveries have led to the development of novel inhibitors of pathways such as Notch and Hedgehog signaling that are currently in early phase clinical trials in the treatment of several cancer types. Retinoid signaling is also essential for pancreatic development, and retinoid therapy is used successfully in other malignancies such as leukemia, but little is known concerning retinoid signaling in PC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the role of retinoid signaling in vitro and in vivo in normal pancreas, pancreatic injury, regeneration and cancer. Retinoid signaling is active in occasional cells in the adult pancreas but is markedly augmented throughout the parenchyma during injury and regeneration. Both chemically induced and genetically engineered mouse models of PC exhibit a lack of retinoid signaling activity compared to normal pancreas. As a consequence, we investigated Cellular Retinoid Binding Protein 1 (CRBP1), a key regulator of retinoid signaling known to play a role in breast cancer development, as a potential therapeutic target. Loss, or significant downregulation of CRBP1 was present in 70% of human PC, and was evident in the very earliest precursor lesions (PanIN-1A). However, in vitro gain and loss of function studies and CRBP1 knockout mice suggested that loss of CRBP1 expression alone was not sufficient to induce carcinogenesis or to alter PC sensitivity to retinoid based therapies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, retinoid signalling appears to play a role in pancreatic regeneration and carcinogenesis, but unlike breast cancer, it is not mediated directly by CRBP1.","['Colvin, Emily K', 'Susanto, Johana M', 'Kench, James G', 'Ong, Vivienna N', 'Mawson, Amanda', 'Pinese, Mark', 'Chang, David K', 'Rooman, Ilse', ""O'Toole, Sandra A"", 'Segara, Davendra', 'Musgrove, Elizabeth A', 'Sutherland, Robert L', 'Apte, Minoti V', 'Scarlett, Christopher J', 'Biankin, Andrew V']","['Colvin EK', 'Susanto JM', 'Kench JG', 'Ong VN', 'Mawson A', 'Pinese M', 'Chang DK', 'Rooman I', ""O'Toole SA"", 'Segara D', 'Musgrove EA', 'Sutherland RL', 'Apte MV', 'Scarlett CJ', 'Biankin AV']","['Cancer Research Program, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111229,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Aging/pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pancreas/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Regeneration/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Staining and Labeling']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/04/26 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029075 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21070 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29075. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029075.

CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome first presented with herpes zoster virus infection-like bullae and erosive plaques on the left side of the face and neck. Treatment with valacyclovir and antibiotics was effective only for the initial lesions, whereas the other bullae kept developing predominantly on the left side. Histopathological study revealed epidermal bulla formation, pandermal neutrophilic infiltration, erythrocyte extravasation and subepidermal oedema, but no vasculitis. The findings suggested the diagnosis of bullous variant of SS. DISCUSSION: Our case was unique in that bullous SS symptoms developed predominantly on one side of the cheek and neck where the herpes zoster infection occurred prior to SS.

Coadministration of lapatinib with obatoclax caused synergistic cell killing by eliciting autophagic cell death that was dependent upstream on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and increased p62 levels and downstream on activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin. By immunohistochemical analysis, in drug combination-treated cells, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) associated with mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase), autophagosome (p62), and autolysosome (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) proteins. Treatment of cells with 3-methyladenine or knockdown of beclin 1 was protective, whereas chloroquine treatment had no protective effect. Expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), compared with that of BCL-2 or BCL-2-related gene long isoform, protected against drug combination lethality. Lapatinib and obatoclax-initiated autophagy depended on NOXA-mediated displacement of the prosurvival BCL-2 family member, MCL-1, from beclin 1, which was essential for the initiation of autophagy. Taken together, our data argue that lapatinib and obatoclax-induced toxic autophagy is due to impaired autophagic degradation, and this disturbance of autophagic flux leads to an accumulation of toxic proteins and loss of mitochondrial function.","['Tang, Yong', 'Hamed, Hossein A', 'Cruickshanks, Nichola', 'Fisher, Paul B', 'Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Tang Y', 'Hamed HA', 'Cruickshanks N', 'Fisher PB', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120104,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Lapatinib', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.111.076851 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.111.076851 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 Apr;81(4):527-40. doi: 10.1124/mol.111.076851.

To investigate this notion, we tested 24 different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on colon cancer cells that harbor a GFP locus stably integrated and silenced by a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. We found that HDACi efficiently reactivated expression of GFP and many other endogenous genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation. After treatment, all promoters were marked with active chromatin, yet DNA hypermethylation did not change. Thus, DNA methylation could not prevent gene reactivation by drug-induced resetting of the chromatin state. In evaluating the relative contribution of DNA methylation and histone modifications to stable gene silencing, we followed expression levels of GFP and other genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation over time after treatment with HDACi or DNA-demethylating drugs. Reactivation of methylated loci by HDACi was detectable for only 2 weeks, whereas DNA-demethylating drugs induced permanent epigenetic reprogramming. Therefore, DNA methylation cannot be considered as a lock for gene expression but rather as a memory signal for long-term maintenance of gene silencing. These findings define chromatin as an important druggable target for cancer epigenetic therapy and suggest that removal of DNA methylation signals is required to achieve long-term gene reactivation.","['Raynal, Noel J-M', 'Si, Jiali', 'Taby, Rodolphe F', 'Gharibyan, Vazganush', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Raynal NJ', 'Si J', 'Taby RF', 'Gharibyan V', 'Ahmed S', 'Jelinek J', 'Estecio MR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120104,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-3248 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3248 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Mar 1;72(5):1170-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3248.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We registered all new AL cases diagnosed 2000-2005. Annual standardized incidence rate (SIR) was calculated by the direct method. A cross-association analysis was performed by non-parametric methods and we checked the potential interaction between putative etiological factors by calculating Chi-square-for-trend. RESULTS: SIR was 5.1 cases per 100 000, surpassing the Spanish, European and world average figures and heterogeneous throughout the region. We detected a negative correlation between acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) SIR in every municipality and both the air distance to the nearest thermoelectric power plant (TPP) (Rho = -0.409; p = 0.01) and to the point of maximum density of the high-power lines (HPL) network (Rho = -0.329; p = 0.04). Accordingly, SIR was higher in the municipalities situated < 7.5 km away from TPP (9.58 vs. 1.72; p = 0.004) or < 10 km away from HPL (3.90 vs. 3.19; p = 0.045). A positive relation between both factors was observed (Chi-square-for-trend = 9.209; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: SIR of AL in BZ is higher than the Spanish average and that of most countries in the world. Residing near TPP or HPL confers a higher risk of AML, with synergistic effect between both factors.","['Rodriguez-Garcia, Jose Antonio', 'Ramos, Fernando']","['Rodriguez-Garcia JA', 'Ramos F']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Leon, Leon, Spain. jrodriguezgar@saludcastillayleon.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120105,Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Spain/epidemiology']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s13382-012-0010-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2012 Mar;25(1):22-30. doi: 10.2478/s13382-012-0010-1.

MDS is associated with a poor overall prognosis and patients are categorized as higher risk and lower risk on the basis of the International Prognostic Scoring System. Currently, lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine are the only three FDA-approved drugs for MDS. Traditional therapies for MDS involve the administration of single agents providing either supportive measures or disease-modifying effects directed to slowing progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and improving survival. Recently, however, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action offers substantial benefit in the form of diminished side effects, improved overall survival, and delayed progression to AML. Multiple studies indicate that when compared with traditional monotherapies, combining various medications with non-overlapping mechanisms of action and toxicities may result in significant benefit for patients with MDS. A variety of combination therapies with growth factors, DNA methytransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and immunosuppressant treatments provide encouraging data indicating that the successful future of MDS treatment rests in the combination of multiple treatments modalities to achieve improved clinical outcomes.","['Ornstein, Moshe C', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Ornstein MC', 'Sekeres MA']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Desk R35, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120106,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-011-0987-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Jan;95(1):26-33. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0987-4.

JCV is endemic and infects a large proportion (70-90%) of healthy individuals worldwide, but infection is latent. JCV reactivation may occur, if the immune function is compromised. AIM: To present a PML case in a CLL patient after a long course of disease and treatment with fludarabine. JCV virus infection in this patient was proven both in brain biopsy material and blood. METHODS: Patient with a nine-year history of CLL was hospitalized with the weakness in the right leg and left hand, tremors, speech difficulties. An MRI diagnosed infiltrative glial tumor of the left hemisphere, proliferating predominantly in the frontal lobe, more in the gyrus frontalis superior region. CNS tumor biopsy performed. RESULTS: Morphology and immunoprofile of the lesion consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The material from biopsy was diagnosed as positive for JCV DNA. JCV and HHV-7 genomic sequences were found in patient's PBL DNA sample. In a plasma DNA sample, only genomic sequences were detected. CONCLUSION: The present case draws attention to the fact that the use of fludarabine and its combinations in CLL therapy increases the risk of JCV infection reactivation and development of serious complications like PML.","['Lejniece, S', 'Murovska, M', 'Chapenko, S', 'Breiksa, B', 'Jaunmuktane, Z', 'Feldmane, L', 'Ziedina, I', 'Gomez-Roman, J', 'Garcia-Cabeza, M', 'Lejnieks, A']","['Lejniece S', 'Murovska M', 'Chapenko S', 'Breiksa B', 'Jaunmuktane Z', 'Feldmane L', 'Ziedina I', 'Gomez-Roman J', 'Garcia-Cabeza M', 'Lejnieks A']","['Riga Eastern Clinical University Hospital, Riga LV1006, Latvia. lejniece@latnet.lv']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain/pathology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 7, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['2420 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2011 Dec;33(4):239-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated in vitro and in vivo synergistic effects of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing ascorbic acid, lysine, proline, and green tea extract, on acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: In vitro, the HL-60 cells were cultured and exposed to NM at doses 0-1000 mug/ml. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion test, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) expression by gelatinase zymography, invasion through Matrigel and apoptosis by live green Poly Caspase Detection Kit. In vivo studies were carried out in athymic nude mice subcutaneously inoculated with HL-60 cells. RESULTS: In vitro, NM exhibited a dose dependent reduction in cells viability. Zymography revealed matrix MMP-2 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced MMP-9 expression. NM inhibited expression of both MMP in a dose dependent manner. Similar step-wise reduction in the Matrigel invasion by HL-60 cells was also observed by this combination with incremental doses. Gradually increasing doses of NM induced significant apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In vivo, NM inhibited tumor growth by 50%. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that NM significantly suppresses tumor growth, decreases cell viability, inhibits MMP expression, Matrigel invasion and induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Roomi, M W', 'Roomi, N W', 'Bhanap, B', 'Rath, M', 'Niedzwiecki, A']","['Roomi MW', 'Roomi NW', 'Bhanap B', 'Rath M', 'Niedzwiecki A']","['Dr. Rath Research Institute, Cancer Division, Santa Clara, CA-95050, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Complex Mixtures)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Complex Mixtures/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['2298 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2011 Dec;33(4):212-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cohort of 31,604 men and women aged 30-74 y living in the study area in Guangdong Province, China, was followed during the period 1979-1998. The information on deaths and migrations of cohort members was collected by visiting study areas every 3-4 y. Cumulative external radiation dose, lagged by 2 y for leukemia and 10 y for cancer excluding leukemia, was estimated for each individual based on hamlet-specific indoor and outdoor doses, and gender- and age-specific house occupancy factors. The follow-up study accumulated 736,942 person-years at risk and ascertained 6,005 deaths, including 956 cancer deaths and 4,525 non-cancer disease deaths. Mean cumulative radiation doses from natural radiation in the HBR and control area residents were 84.8 mGy and 21.6 mGy, respectively. Mortality due to leukemia (15 deaths) or cancer excluding leukemia (941 deaths) was not related to cumulative radiation dose. The excess relative risk (ERR) Gy of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -1.01 (95% CI: -2.53, 0.95). In site-specific analysis, liver-cancer mortality was inversely related to the cumulative dose (p=0.002). Note, however, that liver cancer is well known for its difficulty in accurate diagnosis. The ERR Gy of cancer excluding leukemia and liver cancer was 0.19 (95% CI: -1.87, 3.04). Non-cancer disease mortality was not related to cumulative radiation dose either.

The more effective use of well-known agents as well as refinement of supportive care during the inevitable phase of severe pancytopenia following intensive chemotherapy accounts for the reduction of treatment-related death rate. In addition, mortality due to allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reduced, due to adoption of more effective therapies for graft versus host disease and other transplant-related complications. AREAS COVERED: The multitude of chromosomal and molecular abnormalities makes the treatment of AML a challenging prospect. In addition, genetic aberrations are not mutually exclusive and coexist in the leukemic cells. As a consequence, the clinical development of new biologic agents proceeds slowly. Data for this review were identified from PubMed and references from relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2011. EXPERT OPINION: In Phase II studies, different new agents have been found to be active in AML and are currently under investigation in Phase III trials also in combination with conventional chemotherapy. In the near future, we would have more information about the possibility of introducing new drugs into daily practice.","['Ferrara, Felicetto']",['Ferrara F'],"['Cardarelli Hospital, Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Via Nicolo Piccinni 6, 80128 Napoli, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120105,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.646082 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Feb;21(2):179-89. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.646082.

Few data are available about the incidence and etiology of infectious episodes during the total treatment period associated with a decreased immunity. METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2005 children diagnosed with AML, r-ALL, and MDS, and post-HSCT patients were included in the study. A retrospective review based on microbiological data was performed to describe the incidence and etiology of the infectious complications during the total treatment period. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty disease-specific patient episodes were included. Forty-two percent of 184 microbiologically proven infectious episodes were diagnosed in patients receiving chemotherapy, and 58% occurred in HSCT patients. During neutropenia, 123 (67%) infectious episodes were diagnosed; of the isolated species 83% were bacterial, 6% fungal, and 11% viral. In the period without neutropenia, 61 (33%) infectious episodes were diagnosed, with 38% bacterial, 3% fungal, and 59% viral species isolated. Of the infectious episodes diagnosed in patients treated with an HSCT, 52% (n = 55) occurred in the post-engraftment period. In contrast, in patients treated with chemotherapy, 92% of the infectious episodes were diagnosed during neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The number of proven infectious episodes in post-HSCT patients was not influenced by the presence of neutropenia, while in patients receiving chemotherapy significantly lower numbers of proven infectious episodes were diagnosed outside the neutropenic period.","['Zwitserloot, Annelies M', 'Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Annelies M C', 'Galama, Joep M', 'Verweij, Paul E', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Warris, Adilia']","['Zwitserloot AM', 'Mavinkurve-Groothuis AM', 'Galama JM', 'Verweij PE', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Warris A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Radboud University, Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. a.zwitserloot@cukz.umcn.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120104,England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infections/*complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Mycoses/complications/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/*complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Virus Diseases/complications/epidemiology/virology']",2012/01/06 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/01/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365548.2011.641505 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2012 May;44(5):355-62. doi: 10.3109/00365548.2011.641505.

Nonetheless, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of human vaccines as a possible source of introduction of XMRV and MLV into human populations. To address this possibility, we tested eight live attenuated human vaccines using generic PCR for XMRV and MLV sequences. Viral metagenomics using deep sequencing was also done to identify the possibility of other adventitious agents. RESULTS: All eight live attenuated vaccines, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (SA-14-14-2), varicella (Varivax), measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR-II), measles (Attenuvax), rubella (Meruvax-II), rotavirus (Rotateq and Rotarix), and yellow fever virus were negative for XMRV and highly related MLV sequences. However, residual hamster DNA, but not RNA, containing novel endogenous gammaretrovirus sequences was detected in the JEV vaccine using PCR. Metagenomics analysis did not detect any adventitious viral sequences of public health concern. Intracisternal A particle sequences closest to those present in Syrian hamsters and not mice were also detected in the JEV SA-14-14-2 vaccine. Combined, these results are consistent with the production of the JEV vaccine in Syrian hamster cells. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of XMRV and MLV in eight live attenuated human vaccines further supporting the safety of these vaccines. Our findings suggest that vaccines are an unlikely source of XMRV and MLV exposure in humans and are consistent with the mounting evidence on the absence of these viruses in humans.","['Switzer, William M', 'Zheng, Haoqiang', 'Simmons, Graham', 'Zhou, Yanchen', 'Tang, Shaohua', 'Shankar, Anupama', 'Kapusinszky, Beatrix', 'Delwart, Eric L', 'Heneine, Walid']","['Switzer WM', 'Zheng H', 'Simmons G', 'Zhou Y', 'Tang S', 'Shankar A', 'Kapusinszky B', 'Delwart EL', 'Heneine W']","['Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. bswitzer@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Vaccines)'],IM,"['*Drug Contamination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification', 'Metagenomics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Vaccines/adverse effects']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029223 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17998 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29223. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029223.

Little is known about the effect of lapatinib on leukemia. Using human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells as an experimental model, we found that lapatinib simultaneously induced morphological changes resembling apoptosis, autophagy, and megakaryocytic differentiation. Lapatinib-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and was attenuated by the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, indicating a mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent pathway. Lapatinib-induced autophagic cell death was verified by LC3-II conversion, and upregulation of Beclin-1. Further, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine as well as autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1 (ATG6), ATG7, and ATG5 shRNA knockdown rescued the cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition. A moderate number of lapatinib-treated K562 cells exhibited features of megakaryocytic differentiation. In summary, lapatinib inhibited viability and induced multiple cellular events including apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and megakaryocytic differentiation in human CML K562 cells. This distinct activity of lapatinib against CML cells suggests potential for lapatinib as a therapeutic agent for treatment of CML.

The ultimate goal of all efforts is a better understanding of the mechanisms that discriminate malignant from normal cell biology in order to allow the design of molecular targeted treatment strategies. In individual cases of malignant model diseases addicted to a specific, ideally single oncogene, e.g. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have indeed been able to convert the disease from a ultimately life-threatening into a chronic disease with individual patients staying in remission even without treatment suggestive of operational cure. These developments have been raising hopes to transfer this concept to other cancer types. Unfortunately, cancer cells tend to develop both primary and secondary resistance to targeted drugs in a substantially higher frequency often leading to a failure of treatment clinically. Therefore, a detailed understanding of how cells can bypass targeted inhibition of signaling cascades crucial for malignant growths is necessary. Here, we have performed an in vitro experiment that investigates kinetics and mechanisms underlying resistance development in former drug sensitive cancer cells over time in vitro. We show that the dynamics observed in these experiments can be described by a simple mathematical model. By comparing these experimental data with the mathematical model, important parameters such as mutation rates, cellular fitness and the impact of individual drugs on these processes can be assessed. Excitingly, the experiment and the model suggest two fundamentally different ways of resistance evolution, i.e. acquisition of mutations and phenotype switching, each subject to different parameters. Most importantly, this complementary approach allows to assess the risk of resistance development in the different phases of treatment and thus helps to identify the critical periods where resistance development is most likely to occur.","['Werner, Benjamin', 'Lutz, David', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Traulsen, Arne', 'Balabanov, Stefan']","['Werner B', 'Lutz D', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Traulsen A', 'Balabanov S']","['Evolutionary Theory Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plon, Germany. werner@evolbio.mpg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028955 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20466 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28955. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028955.

It is much more interesting than success."" This CCR Focus section is aimed at identifying lessons to be learned from difficulties encountered in recent years during development of anticancer agents. Clearly, we have not found a silver bullet tyrosine kinase inhibitor against solid tumors comparable with imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although vemurafenib for B-Raf-mutated melanoma and crizotinib for non-small cell lung cancers with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements were developed rapidly and offer hope for individualized targeted therapies, the development of agents targeting a number of other pathways has been slower and less successful. These agents include drugs for blocking the insulin-like growth factor I/insulin receptor pathways, mitotic kinase inhibitors, and Hsp90 antagonists. Several potentially useful, if not groundbreaking, agents have had setbacks in clinical development, including trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and satraplatin. From experience, we have learned the following: (i) not every altered protein or pathway is a valid anticancer target; (ii) drugs must effectively engage the target; (iii) the biology of the systems we use must be very well understood; and (iv) clinical trials must be designed to assess whether the drug reached and impaired the target.

The objective of this study was to delineate the developmental dynamics of potentially important proteins in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, utilizing a collection of endometrial biopsies from women of fertile (n = 89) and infertile (n = 89) couples. METHODS AND RESULTS: Progesterone receptor-B (PGR-B), leukemia inhibitory factor, glycodelin/progestagen-associated endometrial protein (PAEP), homeobox A10, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, calcitonin and chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) were measured using a high-throughput, quantitative immunohistochemical method. Significant cyclic and tissue-specific regulation was documented for each protein, as well as their dysregulation in women of infertile couples. Infertile patients demonstrated a delay early in the secretory phase in the decline of PGR-B (P < 0.05) and premature mid-secretory increases in PAEP (P < 0.05) and CXCL14 (P < 0.05), suggesting that the implantation interval could be closing early. Correlation analysis identified potential interactions among certain proteins that were disrupted by infertility. CONCLUSIONS: This approach overcomes the limitations of a small sample number. Protein expression and localization provided important insights into the potential roles of these proteins in normal and pathological development of the endometrium that is not attainable from transcriptome analysis, establishing a basis for biomarker, diagnostic and targeted drug development for women with infertility.","['Leach, Richard E', 'Jessmon, Philip', 'Coutifaris, Christos', 'Kruger, Michael', 'Myers, Evan R', 'Ali-Fehmi, Rouba', 'Carson, Sandra A', 'Legro, Richard S', 'Schlaff, William D', 'Carr, Bruce R', 'Steinkampf, Michael P', 'Silva, Susan', 'Leppert, Phyllis C', 'Giudice, Linda', 'Diamond, Michael P', 'Armant, D Randall']","['Leach RE', 'Jessmon P', 'Coutifaris C', 'Kruger M', 'Myers ER', 'Ali-Fehmi R', 'Carson SA', 'Legro RS', 'Schlaff WD', 'Carr BR', 'Steinkampf MP', 'Silva S', 'Leppert PC', 'Giudice L', 'Diamond MP', 'Armant DR']","['Michigan State University-Spectrum Health Medical Group, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120102,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (CXCL14 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PAEP protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (progesterone receptor B)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)']",IM,"['Calcitonin/metabolism', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Glycodelin', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infertility, Female/*metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Pregnancy Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['der436 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/der436 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2012 Mar;27(3):814-28. doi: 10.1093/humrep/der436.

Although it is generally accepted that addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) together with either serum or bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is sufficient to maintain mouse ESCs (mESCs) in a self-renewing state, this does not preclude the possibility that autocrine factors are also required. Here we make use of a microfluidic perfusion device that is able to globally diminish diffusible autocrine signaling by applying continuous media flow to deplete cell-secreted factors. We demonstrate mESC culture for several days under continuous microfluidic perfusion and show that cell-secreted factors are removed and can be recovered downstream. We find that perturbing cell-secreted signaling causes mESCs to exit their stable self-renewing state in defined conditions that normally support self-renewal and to exhibit properties characteristic of epiblast cells. This state change is not due to the presence of the known autocrine differentiation inducer fibroblast growth factor 4, but, remarkably, it can be prevented by global remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We also find that cell-secreted matrix remodeling proteins are removed under perfusion and that inhibition of extracellular matrix remodeling causes mESCs to differentiate. Taken together, our data indicate that LIF and BMP4 are not sufficient to maintain self-renewal and that cell-secreted factors are necessary to continuously remodel the ECM and thereby prevent differentiation, revealing a previously undescribed level of mESC regulation through the use of microfluidic perfusion technology.","['Przybyla, Laralynne M', 'Voldman, Joel']","['Przybyla LM', 'Voldman J']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120103,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Germ Layers/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Perfusion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Solubility']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/03/22 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1103100109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1103100109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jan 17;109(3):835-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1103100109.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for imatinib has been suggested to improve efficacy, assess compliance, and evaluate drug-drug interactions. Imatinib has proven efficacy in improving treatment response and survival in patients with Ph+ CML and GIST. Several analytical methods are available to quantify total plasma imatinib concentrations. A good relationship exists between total imatinib plasma concentrations and pharmacologic response. Clinical evaluation of pharmacologic response to imatinib alone may be insufficient given the long duration of therapy before clinical response in patients with Ph+ CML and GIST. Thus, the authors have used a previously published 9-step decision-making algorithm to evaluate the utility of TDM for imatinib. The suggested trough concentrations for improved complete cytogenetic or major molecular response in patients with Ph+ CML and improved time to progression for patients with GIST are >1000 and >1100 ng/mL, respectively. Imatinib exhibits interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Increased apparent clearance of imatinib has been observed in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and increased body weight. Decreased apparent clearance has been observed in renal impairment and patients on concomitant medications with potent inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4. Duration of therapy in patients with Ph+ CML and GIST is lifelong. Based on the available evidence, TDM for imatinib may provide additional information on efficacy, compliance, and safety than clinical evaluation alone. Patients with suboptimal response to treatment, treatment failure, rare adverse events, drug interactions, or suspected nonadherence will attain the greatest benefit from TDM.","['Teng, Jennifer F T', 'Mabasa, Vincent H', 'Ensom, Mary H H']","['Teng JF', 'Mabasa VH', 'Ensom MH']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e31823cdec9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2012 Feb;34(1):85-97. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31823cdec9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICA expression is induced in cancer cells favoring their elimination by the immune system; however, many advanced tumors shed soluble MICA (sMICA), which impairs NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. ERp5 and GRP78 are endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins that are translocated to the surface of epithelial tumor cells where they interact with MICA and are involved in sMICA shedding. In this study, we analyze the role of ERp5 and GRP78 in sMICA shedding in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses showed that ERp5 and GRP78 were significantly expressed on the surface of B cells and leukemia cells, but they were not expressed on T cells. The expression of ERp5 and GRP78 was significantly higher in leukemia cells than in B cells from controls. ERp5 and GRP78 co-localized with MICA on the surface of leukemia cells and the levels of expression of ERp5 and GRP78 correlated with the level of expression of membrane-bound MICA in CLL patients. Associated with higher expression of membrane-bound ERp5 and GRP78, serum sMICA levels were approximately threefold higher in patients than in controls. Elevated sMICA levels in CLL patients were associated with the down-modulation of NKG2D surface expression on CD8 T cells. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of B cell lines and stimulated leukemia cells showed that ERp5 activity is involved in sMICA shedding in CLL. In conclusion, these results uncover a molecular mechanism which regulates MICA protein shedding and immune evasion in CLL.","['Huergo-Zapico, Leticia', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana P', 'Contesti, Juan', 'Gonzalez, Esther', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Fernandez-Guizan, Azahara', 'Acebes-Huerta, Andrea', 'de Los Toyos, Juan R', 'Lopez-Larrea, Carlos', 'Groh, Veronika', 'Spies, Thomas', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Huergo-Zapico L', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Contesti J', 'Gonzalez E', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Fernandez-Guizan A', 'Acebes-Huerta A', 'de Los Toyos JR', 'Lopez-Larrea C', 'Groh V', 'Spies T', 'Gonzalez S']","['Functional Biology Department.

To increase knowledge about pandemic influenza in children with leukemia and better understand the risk factors for severe disease, we have presented the clinical characteristics of 8 children with acute leukemia and pandemic influenza treated at our center. The mean age of the children (4 girls and 4 boys) was 6.7+/-2.0 years (range, 4 to 10 y). All these children [3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases] were receiving chemotherapy during the course of infection, except 1 who was found to be H1N1 positive at the same time that she was diagnosed with AML. Among the other 7 patients undergoing chemotherapy, 4 were receiving induction, 1 was receiving consolidation, and 2 were undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. In our series, 1 patient with AML had a fatal course. She had recently received a chemotherapy bloc. Her neutrophil count was 0 during the course of H1N1 infection. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within a short time after the symptoms commenced and she died within 4 days. In conclusion, the clinical course of H1N1 infection may be fatal in rare cases of leukemic children receiving chemotherapy. Thus, vaccination is advisable for all leukemic children, especially for those under maintenance chemotherapy, as it might be life saving during such pandemics.","['Tavil, Betul', 'Azik, Fatih', 'Culha, Vildan', 'Kara, Abdurrahman', 'Yaral, Nese', 'Tezer, Hasan', 'Tunc, Bahattin']","['Tavil B', 'Azik F', 'Culha V', 'Kara A', 'Yaral N', 'Tezer H', 'Tunc B']","[""Departments of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Diskapi, Ankara/Turkey. betultavil@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza, Human/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Oseltamivir/therapeutic use', '*Pandemics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182387d57 [doi]', '00043426-201201000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jan;34(1):48-50. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182387d57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One explanation for this is inherited genetic variation. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes inactivate a number of chemotherapeutic drugs administered in childhood ALL therapy. Two multiplexing methods were applied for genotyping the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes (distinguishing between 0, 1, or 2 gene copies) and the GSTP1 313 A>G polymorphism, simultaneously. A total of 263 childhood ALL patients were genotyped. No gene dose effect on outcome was demonstrated with either GST polymorphisms. Grouping of GSTM1 and GSTT1 into poor (0 or 1 gene copy)-and good metabolizers (at least 2 gene copies)-showed that the poor metabolizers had a trend toward a better outcome (event-free survival =91.8%) compared with the good metabolizers (event-free survival =83.2%). Similarly, in the adjusted analysis the good metabolizers demonstrated a 2.2-fold higher risk trend of experiencing an event (resistant disease or relapse) compared with the poor metabolizers (P=0.066; hazard ratio =2.248; 95% confidence interval, 0.948-5.327).

In our hospital, we performed retrospective analyses to determine risk factors for mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by P. aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted among adult patients with bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa at Jikei University Hospital. We analyzed factors, such as age, gender, underlying disease, initial antimicrobial treatment, and primary site of infection to determine which of these were predictive of mortality in patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified between April 2003 and March 2010. The 30-day mortality rate among all patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia was 20.9%. The most common underlying disease was leukemia (20.9%), and the most common primary site of infection was the urinary tract (24.6%). Seventy-one patients (65.7%) were treated with an appropriate initial antimicrobial regimen for P. aeruginosa bacteremia. However, these patients had similar 30-day mortality to that observed in patients not administered appropriate antibiotics. This study revealed that risk factors for the 30-day mortality were thrombocytopenia and polymicrobial P. aeruginosa bacteremia (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia and polymicrobial bacteremia were associated with a greater incidence of 30-day mortality among patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia. On the other hand, age, underlying disease, and inappropriate initial empirical antimicrobial treatment did not affect mortality.","['Horino, Tetsuya', 'Chiba, Akio', 'Kawano, Shinji', 'Kato, Tetsuro', 'Sato, Fumiya', 'Maruyama, Yukio', 'Nakazawa, Yasushi', 'Yoshikawa, Koji', 'Yoshida, Masaki', 'Hori, Seiji']","['Horino T', 'Chiba A', 'Kawano S', 'Kato T', 'Sato F', 'Maruyama Y', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Yoshida M', 'Hori S']","['Department of Infectious Disease and Infection Control, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Japan. horino@jikei.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120101,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudomonas Infections/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications', 'Urinary Tract Infections/drug therapy/etiology/mortality']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/51.5698 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.51.5698 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2012;51(1):59-64. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.51.5698.

AIM: To report the first case of nonischemic priapism following penile tattooing. METHODS: A case with tattooing-induced priapism is presented including subjective reporting, physical examination, and laboratory/radiologic evaluations. RESULTS: A 21-year-old man, presented with partially rigid penis of 3-month duration. On examination, the penis was half rigid, with a tattoo on its dorsal surface, and a smaller tattoo on the glans (Figure 1). The patient initially stated that the tattoo had been created years ago, but later admitted that he had it created just before the occurrence of priapism. A traditional tattooist created the tattoo manually, using a handheld needle. Bleeding from deep penile tissue for several days complicated the tattooing. Known etiologies of priapism were investigated and ruled out. Specifically, perineal injury, leukemia, sickle cell trait, thalassemia, urinary tract infection, neurogenic, neoplastic, infectious, toxic, and pharmacological causes were actively investigated and ruled out. There was no history of alcohol consumption or smoking. Aspirated penile blood was bright red. Cavernous blood gas measurements confirmed high oxygen and low carbon dioxide content, diagnostic of arterial priapism. There was no embolization facility in Kermanshah. In fact, there are few experts in superselective embolization in Iran. We referred the patient for superselective embolization. However, he underwent a nonindicated Sacher procedure. Predictably, the procedure was unsuccessful. At present, the patient continues to have priapism. Because of the painless nature of erections, moderately good preservation of erectile function during intercourses, and disappointment with former surgery, the patient declined further therapies, and he lives with his condition. CONCLUSIONS: Tattooing should be added to the etiologies of nonischemic priapism. Considering this case, we discourage penile tattooing.","['Zargooshi, Javaad', 'Rahmanian, Elham', 'Motaee, Hiwa', 'Kohzadi, Mozhgan']","['Zargooshi J', 'Rahmanian E', 'Motaee H', 'Kohzadi M']","['Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120103,Netherlands,J Sex Med,The journal of sexual medicine,101230693,,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', '*Penis', 'Priapism/*etiology', 'Tattooing/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/05 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/01/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02579.x [doi]', 'S1743-6095(15)33890-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Sex Med. 2012 Mar;9(3):844-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02579.x.

METHOD: A total of 1003 AA patients hospitalized in our institute hospital between January 1991 and December 2009 enrolled into this study. The incidence and risk factors for AA developing MDS/AML by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 62 (2 - 423) months and the projected 5-year survival rate was (78.0 +/- 1.0)%. Twenty-seven patients evolved to MDS/AML, of whom 11, 6 and 10 were from NSAA, SAA and VSAA subgroups, respectively. The estimated cumulative incidence of MDS/AML transformation for these 1003 patients after diagnosis was (4.5 +/- 1.0)% at 10 year. The incidence of MDS/AML transformation in VSAA subgroup [(12.8 +/- 3.5)%] was significantly higher than in NSAA subgroup [(4.1 +/- 1.9)%] (P < 0.001) and SAA subgroup [(3.5 +/- 1.4)% ] (P = 0.008), but no difference between the latter two subgroups (P = 0.616).

METHODS: One hundred and three de novo inv(16)/t(16;16) (CBFbeta-MYH11) AML patients were followed-up and retrospectively analyzed. Polymorphisms of RAD51-G135C and XRCC3-C241T were detected by PCR-RFLP. The prognostic factors,including sex, age, white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin level, karyotype, KIT mutation, RAD51-G135C and XRCC3-C241T polymorphisms at diagnosis, for complete remission (CR) achievement, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median follow-up of all patients was 28 (1 - 106) months. The overall CR rate was 92.2%. The estimated 5-year OS and RFS rates were 43.6% (95% CI 37.7% - 49.5%) and 26.4% (95% CI 21.1% - 31.7%), and the median OS and RFS were 53 (95% CI 133.4 - 72.7) and 27 (95% CI 22.9 - 31.1) months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, higher WBC (P = 0.004) and older than 30 years of age (P = 0.035) were independent poor factors for CR achievement, the XRCC3-241T variant (P = 0.007) and higher WBC (P = 0.009) were independent poor factors for 5-year RFS, and higher WBC (P = 0.002) and trisomy 8 (P = 0.035) were independent poor factors for 5-year survival. Polymorphism of RAD51-G135C had no significant impact on the prognosis.

Here, we developed a software tool capable of automated gating of color-coded microspheres, automatic extraction of statistics from all subsets and validation, normalization, and cross-sample analysis. The approach presented in this article enabled us to harness the power of high-content cellular proteomics. In size exclusion chromatography-resolved microsphere-based affinity proteomics (Size-MAP), antibody-coupled microspheres are used to measure biotinylated proteins that have been separated by size exclusion chromatography. The captured proteins are labeled with streptavidin phycoerythrin and detected by multicolor flow cytometry. When the results from multiple size exclusion chromatography fractions are combined, binding is detected as discrete reactivity peaks (entities). The information obtained might be approximated to a multiplexed western blot. We used a microsphere set with >1,000 subsets, presenting an approach to extract biologically relevant information. The R-project environment was used to sequentially recognize subsets in two-dimensional space and gate them. The aim was to extract the median streptavidin phycoerythrin fluorescence intensity for all 1,000+ microsphere subsets from a series of 96 measured samples. The resulting text files were subjected to algorithms that identified entities across the 24 fractions. Thus, the original 24 data points for each antibody were compressed to 1-4 integrated values representing the areas of individual antibody reactivity peaks. Finally, we provide experimental data on cellular protein changes induced by treatment of leukemia cells with imatinib mesylate. The approach presented here exemplifies how large-scale flow cytometry data analysis can be efficiently processed to employ flow cytometry as a high-content proteomics method.","['Stuchly, Jan', 'Kanderova, Veronika', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Cerna, Daniela', 'Holm, Anders', 'Wu, Weiwei', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof', 'Kalina, Tomas']","['Stuchly J', 'Kanderova V', 'Fiser K', 'Cerna D', 'Holm A', 'Wu W', 'Hrusak O', 'Lund-Johansen F', 'Kalina T']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111228,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Results showed a significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to that of untreated controls. More importantly, mean lifespan of tumor bearing animals treated with MPTQ was significantly higher as compared to that of untreated tumor bearing mice suggesting that the treatment affected viability of cancerous cells, but not of normal cells. Consistent with this, we find that administration of MPTQ to normal mice did not cause any major side effects as observed upon hematological and serum profiling. We also found that MPTQ induces cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines, by activating apoptosis both by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.

Although this approach has been found to be safe and feasible in younger patients, its safety in older patients remains unknown. We therefore undertook an evaluation of outpatient-based consolidation chemotherapy in older AML patients, and compared results to younger patients treated at the same institution over the same time period. The overall rate of readmission was ~50%, mostly for infections, with mean admission duration of 2 weeks. The overall mortality rate was 2.2%. Readmission rates and duration of readmission were somewhat higher in older patients, but infection rate, intensive care (ICU) admissions, and mortality rates were comparable to those in the younger patient cohort. However, we also observed that rates of febrile neutropenia, bacteremia, ICU admission, and death were significantly higher during the second consolidation, as compared with the first, in both younger and older patients.

RESULTS: This review consistently found strong inverse correlations with solar UVB for 15 types of cancer: bladder, breast, cervical, colon, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, rectal, renal, and vulvar cancer; and Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Weaker evidence exists for nine other types of cancer: brain, gallbladder, laryngeal, oral/pharyngeal, prostate, and thyroid cancer; leukemia; melanoma; and multiple myeloma.

In most cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the PML and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) genes are translocated, resulting in expression of oncogenic PML-RARalpha fusion proteins. PML-NB fail to form normally, and promyelocytes remain in an undifferentiated, abnormally proliferative state. We examined the involvement of PML protein and PML-NB in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks. Transient overexpression of wild-type PML protein isoforms produced hugely enlarged or aggregated PML-NB and reduced HRR by ~2-fold, suggesting that HRR depends to some extent upon normal PML-NB structure. Knockdown of PML by RNA interference sharply attenuated formation of PML-NB and reduced HRR by up to 20-fold. However, PML-knockdown cells showed apparently normal induction of H2AX phosphorylation and RAD51 foci after DNA damage by ionizing radiation. These findings indicate that early steps in HRR, including recognition of DNA double-strand breaks, initial processing of ends, and assembly of single-stranded DNA/RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, do not depend upon PML-NB. The HRR deficit in PML-depleted cells thus reflects inhibition of later steps in the repair pathway. Expression of PML-RARalpha fusion proteins disrupted PML-NB structure and reduced HRR by up to 10-fold, raising the possibility that defective HRR and resulting genomic instability may figure in the pathogenesis, progression and relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Yeung, Percy Luk', 'Denissova, Natalia G', 'Nasello, Cara', 'Hakhverdyan, Zhanna', 'Chen, J Don', 'Brenneman, Mark A']","['Yeung PL', 'Denissova NG', 'Nasello C', 'Hakhverdyan Z', 'Chen JD', 'Brenneman MA']","['The Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', '*Recombinational DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24050 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 May;113(5):1787-99. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24050.,"['R21 CA122795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA122795-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA122795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3337353,,['NIHMS346566'],"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the BRAF V600E mutation was uniformly identified in one HCL series, which may provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms. The disease course is usually indolent but inexorably progressive. Patients require treatment when they have significant cytopenia or occasionally recurrent infections from immunocompromise. In the mid-1980s, interferon replaced splenectomy as the initial treatment. A few years later, 2 purine nucleoside analogs, cladribine and pentostatin, showed promising activity in HCL. Complete response rates approached 95% with cladribine given as a single 7-day intravenous infusion. Newer methods of cladribine administration and modified dosing schedules have since been studied. Pentostatin response rates are comparable. We generally prefer cladribine because of its ease of administration, single infusion schema, and favorable toxicity profile. Since the introduction of these drugs, which have never been randomly compared, long-term follow-up studies have confirmed impressive and durable response durations. However, roughly 40% of patients with HCL eventually relapse. In this setting, patients can be re-treated with purine analogs. Rituximab also has a reasonable response rate in relapsed HCL; it can be given as a single agent sequentially after purine nucleosides or concurrently. Immunotoxins have robust responses but remain in development. Targeting the BRAF pathway will be an exciting future area of research. Many patients have minimal residual disease after initial treatment, but the clinical significance of this remains unknown.","['Naik, Rahul R', 'Saven, Alan']","['Naik RR', 'Saven A']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)00008-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Jan;87(1):67-76. doi: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.09.001.,,PMC3498175,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand consecutive patients with primary myelofibrosis seen at Mayo Clinic between November 4, 1977, and September 1, 2011, were considered. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), dynamic IPSS (DIPSS), and DIPSS-plus were applied for risk stratification. Separate analyses were included for patients seen at time of referral (N=1000), at initial diagnosis (N=340), and within or after 1 year of diagnosis (N=660). RESULTS: To date, 592 deaths and 68 leukemic transformations have been documented. Parameters at initial diagnosis vs time of referral included median age (66 vs 65 years), male sex (61% vs 62%), red cell transfusion need (24% vs 38%), hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL (38% vs 54%), platelet count less than 100 x 10(9)/L (18% vs 26%), leukocyte count more than 25 x 10(9)/L (13% vs 16%), marked splenomegaly (21% vs 31%), constitutional symptoms (29% vs 34%), and abnormal karyotype (31% vs 41%). Mutational frequencies were 61% for JAK2V617F, 8% for MPLW515, and 4% for IDH1/2. DIPSS-plus risk distributions at time of referral were 10% low, 15% intermediate-1, 37% intermediate-2, and 37% high. The corresponding median survivals were 17.5, 7.8, 3.6, and 1.8 years vs 20.0, 14.3, 5.3, and 1.7 years for patients younger than 60 years of age. Compared with both DIPSS and IPSS, DIPSS-plus showed better discrimination among risk groups. Five-year leukemic transformation rates were 6% and 21% in low- and high-risk patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The current document should serve as a valuable resource for patients and physicians and provides context for the design and interpretation of clinical trials.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Jimma, Thitina', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Vaidya, Rakhee', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Pardanani, Animesh']","['Tefferi A', 'Lasho TL', 'Jimma T', 'Finke CM', 'Gangat N', 'Vaidya R', 'Begna KH', 'Al-Kali A', 'Ketterling RP', 'Hanson CA', 'Pardanani A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)00013-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Jan;87(1):25-33. doi: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.11.001.,,PMC3538387,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing the constitutively active FLT3-ITD receptor tyrosine kinase, MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of serine 21 (S21) inhibits the ability of C/EBPalpha to induce granulocytic differentiation. To assess whether this post-translational modification also modulates the activity of C/EBPalpha in BCR/ABL-expressing cells, we tested the biological effects of wild-type and mutant C/EBPalpha mimicking phosphorylated or non-phosphorylatable serine 21 (S21D and S21A, respectively) in K562 cells ectopically expressing tamoxifen-regulated C/EBPalpha-ER chimeric proteins. We show here that S21D C/EBPalpha-ER induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of K562 cells almost as well as wild-type C/EBPalpha-ER, while S21A C/EBPalpha-ER was less efficient. Furthermore, wild-type C/EBPalpha suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of K562 cells vigorously, while S21D and S21A C/EBPalpha mutants had more modest anti-proliferative effects. Both mutants were less effective than wild-type C/EBPalpha in suppressing endogenous E2F-dependent transactivation and bound less E2F-2 and/or E2F-3 proteins in anti-C/EBPalpha immunoprecipitates. Together, these findings suggest that mutation of S21 more than its phosphorylation inhibits the anti-proliferative effects of C/EBPalpha due to reduced interaction with or impaired regulation of the activity of E2F proteins. By contrast, phosphorylation of serine 21 appears to have a modest role in modulating the differentiation-inducing effects of C/EBPalpha in K562 cells.","['Fragliasso, Valentina', 'Chiodo, Yuri', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, Giovanna', 'Soliera, Angela Rachele', 'Manzotti, Gloria', 'Cattelani, Sara', 'Candini, Olivia', 'Grisendi, Giulia', 'Vergalli, Jenny', 'Mariani, Samanta Antonella', 'Guerzoni, Clara', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Fragliasso V', 'Chiodo Y', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Soliera AR', 'Manzotti G', 'Cattelani S', 'Candini O', 'Grisendi G', 'Vergalli J', 'Mariani SA', 'Guerzoni C', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'E2F Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24040 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 May;113(5):1704-13. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24040.,"['R01 CA095111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095111-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3329570,,['NIHMS348720'],"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of apatinib, an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on enhancing the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs in side population (SP) cells and ABCB1-overexpressing leukemia cells in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. Our results showed that apatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in SP cells sorted from K562 cells. Furthermore, apatinib also strongly reversed multidrug resistance (MDR) in K562/ADR cells, and the primary leukemia blasts overexpressing ABCB1 while showed no synergistic interactions with chemotherapeutic agents in MRP1-, MRP4-, MRP7- and LRP-overexpressing cells. Apatinib treatment markedly increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 in K562/ADR cells and the accumulation of rhodamine 123 in the primary leukemia blasts with ABCB1 overexpression. Apatinib stimulated the ATPase activity of P-gp in a dose-dependent manner but did not alter the expression of ABCB1 at both mRNA and protein levels. The phosphorylation level of AKT and ERK1/2 remained unchanged after apatinib treatment in both sensitive and MDR cells. Importantly, apatinib significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin in nude mice bearing K562/ADR xenografts. Taken together, our results suggest that apatinib could target to SP cells and ABCB1-overexpressing leukemia cells to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.

We have created a human-specific cellular system to study early hemato-endothelial development in MLL-AF4-expressing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Functional studies, clonal analysis and gene expression profiling reveal that expression of MLL-AF4 in hESCs has a phenotypic, functional and gene expression impact. MLL-AF4 acts as a global transcriptional activator and a positive regulator of homeobox gene expression in hESCs. Functionally, MLL-AF4 enhances the specification of hemogenic precursors from hESCs but strongly impairs further hematopoietic commitment in favor of an endothelial cell fate. MLL-AF4 hESCs are transcriptionally primed to differentiate towards hemogenic precursors prone to endothelial maturation, as reflected by the marked upregulation of master genes associated to vascular-endothelial functions and early hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we report that MLL-AF4 expression is not sufficient to transform hESC-derived hematopoietic cells. This work illustrates how hESCs may provide unique insights into human development and further our understanding of how leukemic fusion genes, known to arise prenatally, regulate human embryonic hematopoietic specification.","['Bueno, Clara', 'Montes, Rosa', 'Melen, Gustavo J', 'Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Sanchez, Laura', 'Ligero, Gertrudis', 'Gutierrez-Aranda, Ivan', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Moreno-Gimeno, Inmaculada', 'Burks, Deborah', 'Plaza-Calonge, Maria del Carmen', 'Rodriguez-Manzaneque, Juan C', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Bueno C', 'Montes R', 'Melen GJ', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Real PJ', 'Ayllon V', 'Sanchez L', 'Ligero G', 'Gutierrez-Aranda I', 'Fernandez AF', 'Fraga MF', 'Moreno-Gimeno I', 'Burks D', 'Plaza-Calonge Mdel C', 'Rodriguez-Manzaneque JC', 'Menendez P']","['GENyO (Pfizer-University of Granada-Andalusian Government Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research), Avda de la Ilustracion 114, 18007 Granada, Spain. clara.bueno@genyo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120103,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cr20124 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2012.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2012 Jun;22(6):986-1002. doi: 10.1038/cr.2012.4.

The purpose of this study was to investigate such relationships and give insights into the PK of this combination treatment. METHODS: A prospective population PK study of twenty-three patients with acute myeloid leukemia was undertaken. Plasma concentrations of patients were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. PK models were developed with NONMEM; for daunorubicin, PK information from a prior study was utilized. RESULTS: Baseline white blood cell count (bWBC) influenced the PK for all drugs. A small, statistically insignificant improvement in model fit was achieved when a relationship between bWBC and daunorubicin central volume of distribution was included. The volume increased 1.9% for each increase in bWBC by 1 x 10(6) cells/mL. The clearances of etoposide and cytarabine were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, by increased bWBC. Tenfold changes in bWBC were needed for these relationships to have potential clinical relevance. A decrease in creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min resulted in a decrease in etoposide clearance of 32%. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based models characterized the PK for all three drugs. bWBC was a significant covariate for etoposide and cytarabine and showed a trend for daunorubicin. Linking the significant bWBC relationships and the relationship between kidney function and etoposide clearance to clinical end points would support dose individualization. Patients with above-normal creatinine clearances and high bWBC may receive sub-optimal treatment due to elevated etoposide clearances.","['Krogh-Madsen, Mikkel', 'Bender, Brendan', 'Jensen, Morten Krogh', 'Nielsen, Ove Juul', 'Friberg, Lena E', 'Honore, Per Hartvig']","['Krogh-Madsen M', 'Bender B', 'Jensen MK', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Friberg LE', 'Honore PH']","['Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Jagtvej 160, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. mkm@farma.ku.dk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20120103,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Body Surface Area', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Creatinine/blood/urine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1800-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 May;69(5):1155-63. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1800-z.

METHODS: Flow immunocytometry was performed by direct multicolor immunofluorescent technique on bone marrow aspirates. Cytogenetic analyses were performed using G-banding method by direct preparation of unstimulated bone marrow cells and following 24 hours of culture in RPMI 1540 culture medium with 25% fetal calf serum at 37 degrees C RESULTS: The flow immunocytometry of bone marrow nucleated cells revealed the existance of three distinct blast cell populations with overlapping immunophenotypes.

The predominant final common pathogenetic pathway causing ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS has been the varying degrees of apoptosis of the hematopoietic precursors and their progeny. A variety of molecular abnormalities have been demonstrated in MDS. These lesions are attributable to nonrandom cytogenetic and oncogenic mutations, indicative of chromosomal and genetic instability, transcriptional RNA splicing abnormalities, and epigenetic changes. Evolutionary cytogenetic changes may occur during the course of the disorder, which are associated with disease progression. These genetic derangements reflect a multistep process believed to underlie the transformation of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia. Recent findings provide molecular insights into specific gene mutations playing major roles for the development and clinical outcome of MDS and their propensity to progress to a more aggressive stage. Use of more comprehensive and sensitive methods for molecular profiling using 'next-generation' sequencing techniques for MDS marrow cells will likely further define critical biologic lesions underlying this spectrum of diseases.","['Greenberg, P L']",['Greenberg PL'],"['Hematology Division, Stanford University Cancer Center, Stanford, CA, USA. peterg@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111227,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/11/10 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01390.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Jun;34(3):215-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01390.x.

Occult retroviral infection among humans poses a significant public health risk should it be introduced into the blood supply. To explore the possibility of cross-species transmission of MLVs to humans, we sought molecular and serologic evidence of XRMV/MLV infection among a cohort of animal workers highly exposed to mice. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Before the commencement of the study, the laboratory and equipment were demonstrated to be free of XMRV/MLV DNA sequences. DNA extracted from 43 animal workers was tested using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with published primer sets, targeting regions of XMRV and MLV gag. Negative controls were assayed in a 1:1 ratio with specimens. Serum specimens were tested using a validated immunoblot assay containing cross-reactive XMRV antigens. RESULTS: Initial molecular assays demonstrated that the physical space and laboratory equipment were free of MLV and XMRV DNA sequences. Nested PCR assays using multiple primer sets successfully amplified XMRV and MLV sequences from positive controls with high sensitivity. A single, nonreproducible, false-positive result from one specimen was shown to be the result of subsequent contamination. Immunoblotting of all subjects' sera failed to demonstrate any evidence of seroreactivity to XMRV proteins. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of human infection with XMRV/MLV among a cohort of individuals highly exposed to mice. These data suggest that the likelihood of cross-species transmission events of MLV from mice to humans is low.","['Brooks, James', 'Lycett-Lambert, Karly', 'Caminiti, Kyna', 'Merks, Harriet', 'McMillan, Rachel', 'Sandstrom, Paul']","['Brooks J', 'Lycett-Lambert K', 'Caminiti K', 'Merks H', 'McMillan R', 'Sandstrom P']","['National HIV & Retrovirology Laboratories, National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Canada. james.brooks@phac-aspc.gc.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111230,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animal Technicians/*statistics & numerical data', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Laboratory Personnel/statistics & numerical data', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Species Specificity', 'Validation Studies as Topic', '*Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/physiology']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2012/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03463.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Feb;52(2):317-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03463.x.

It acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of the bcr-abl fusion protein by a competitive inhibition at the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the enzyme, which leads to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins involved in bcr-abl signal transduction. IM is generally well tolerated and usually provokes only mild side effects consisting of nausea, myalgia, edema and muscle cramps. OBSERVATION: This is a report of a patient affected by CML, who developed a photoinduced dermatitis and an oral lichenoid reaction associated with IM treatment. The lesions were resolved, thanks to the withdrawal of the therapy, and they relapsed after the reintroduction of IM, confirming the drug-induced pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Skin changes are the most common non-hematologic side effects to IM treatment and are usually dose dependent. In particular, patients with IM therapy reported a lightening and depigmentation of the skin, that may alter the skin protection against ultraviolet exposure, with a possible subsequent intolerance to sun exposure, as reported in our patient, and higher risk of skin cancer. They are frequently self-limited or easily managed; nevertheless, in some cases, the therapy needs to be discontinued or may only be continued with concomitant oral steroid.","['Brazzelli, Valeria', 'Muzio, Francesca', 'Manna, Giambattista', 'Moggio, Erica', 'Vassallo, Camilla', 'Orlandi, Ester', 'Fiandrino, Giacomo', 'Lucioni, Marco', 'Borroni, Giovanni']","['Brazzelli V', 'Muzio F', 'Manna G', 'Moggio E', 'Vassallo C', 'Orlandi E', 'Fiandrino G', 'Lucioni M', 'Borroni G']","['Institute of Dermatology, University of Pavia and Foundation IRCCS Policlinico S.

Individuals with FAS - 1377AG had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.72 for the risk of ALL compared to - 1377GG and the variant FASL - 844CC was associated with a statistically significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL (OR = 0.38). Furthermore, combined genotypes with 5-8 protective alleles were associated with a significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL compared with those with 0-4 variants, and this decreased risk was more pronounced among the subgroups of age < 6 years, female, parental never-drinking status and never house-painting. Our results provide evidence that FAS-FASL-CASP8 polymorphisms contributed to a reduced risk of childhood ALL in our population.

A panel of barbituric, thiobarbituric and selenobarbituric acid analogues of Merocyanine 540 was photobleached, and the resulting photoproducts were characterized by absorption, fluorescence emission, mass, energy dispersive X-ray, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and tested for cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines and freshly explanted bone marrow cells. While all dyes were readily photobleached, only photoproducts of selone dyes showed cytotoxic activity. One-hour incubations with micromolar concentrations of selone-derived photoproducts were sufficient to reduce leukemia/lymphoma cells >/=10 000 fold, whereas preserving virtually all normal CD34-positive bone marrow cells. Of six multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines tested, five were as sensitive or more sensitive to photoproducts than the corresponding wild-type lines. Physicochemical characterizations of the cytotoxic activity indicated that it consisted of conjugates of subnano particles of elemental selenium and (lipo)proteins. The discovery of cytotoxic Se-protein conjugates provides a rare example of photoproducts contributing substantially to the antitumor effect of PDT and challenges the long-held view that Se in oxidation state zero is biologically inert.

The immunoprofiles of 63 patients in the chronic phase of CML were evaluated during treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, n = 36; nilotinib, n = 9; dasatinib, n = 18). The numbers of CD56 + CD57 + and CD3 + CD57 + cells increased significantly in the dasatinib group. The numbers of regulatory T-cells were comparable among the three groups. Dasatinib markedly enhanced natural killer (NK)-cell reactivity. Only one patient treated with dasatinib showed a slight cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. In contrast, nilotinib suppressed NK-cell reactivity. Plasma levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly elevated in all three groups, and plasma levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly elevated in the imatinib and dasatinib groups.

Her vellus scalp hair gradually came out, and hair loss progressed again at 8 years, after BMT.

The aim of this study was to study the susceptibility of human leukemia cell lines to SP-B. We found that NALM-6 human B cell leukemia cells are the most susceptible to SP-B. There was a low correlation between the expression of HDAC1 mRNA and HDI susceptibility of leukemia cells. NALM-6 has higher endogenous p21waf1/cip1 mRNA expression than other leukemia cells. SP-B-induced cytotoxicity was mediated by induction of histone acetylation via inhibition of HDACs, and this effect of SP-B was associated with apoptosis, which was mediated by caspase activation in NALM-6 cells. SP-B time-dependently increased the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) peak, and this effect correlated with SP-B induction of cellular apoptotic features such as changes in nuclear morphology. SP-B significantly increased p21waf1/cip1 expression prior to induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, NALM-6 cells, which have a higher expression of p21waf1/cip1 mRNA than other leukemia cell lines, were susceptible to SP-B-induced cytotoxicity that resulted in induction of apoptosis.

Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment for adult CML by eliminating allogeneic stem cell transplantation for almost all patients in chronic phase. Shown effective in pediatric CML, imatinib and successive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have provided more therapeutic options. Because stem cell transplantation has been better tolerated in children and adolescents, the decision to treat by either TKI or transplantation is controversial. We present a recent case of a 12-month-old boy diagnosed with BCR-ABL(+) CML to highlight the controversies in treatment recommendations. We review the pediatric stem cell transplantation outcomes as well as the pediatric experience with imatinib and other TKIs. Finally, we compare the side effects as well as costs associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation versus TKI therapy. We recommend that frontline therapy for pediatric CML in chronic phase is TKI therapy without transplantation. Patients in accelerated or blast crisis or who fail to reach landmarks on TKIs either because of intolerance or resistance should pursue stem cell transplantation. Although we recommend adopting adult clinical experience to guide therapeutic decision making, the issues of infant CML, drug formulation, pharmacokinetics, and adolescent compliance merit clinical investigation.","['Andolina, Jeffrey R', 'Neudorf, Steven M', 'Corey, Seth J']","['Andolina JR', 'Neudorf SM', 'Corey SJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA. jeffrey_andolina@urmc.rochester.edu""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111230,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46038-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-380774 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 23;119(8):1821-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-380774.

Statistical modeling of an outcome predictor revealed 3 genes highly predictive of event-free survival (EFS), beyond age and MLL status: FLT3, IRX2, and TACC2. Low FLT3 expression was found in a group of infants with excellent outcome (n = 11; 5-year EFS of 100%), whereas differential expression of IRX2 and TACC2 partitioned the remaining infants into 2 groups with significantly different survivals (5-year EFS of 16% vs 64%; P < .001). When infants with MLL-AFF1 were analyzed separately, a 7-gene classifier was developed that split them into 2 distinct groups with significantly different outcomes (5-year EFS of 20% vs 65%; P < .001). In this classifier, elevated expression of NEGR1 was associated with better EFS, whereas IRX2, EPS8, and TPD52 expression were correlated with worse outcome. This classifier also predicted EFS in an independent infant ALL cohort from the Interfant-99 trial. When evaluating expression profiles as a continuous variable relative to patient age, we further identified striking differences in profiles in infants less than or equal to 90 days of age and those more than 90 days of age. These age-related patterns suggest different mechanisms of leukemogenesis and may underlie the differential outcomes historically seen in these age groups.","['Kang, Huining', 'Wilson, Carla S', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Murphy, Maurice H', 'Atlas, Susan R', 'Bedrick, Edward J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Robinson, Blaine W', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Carroll, William L', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Willman, Cheryl L']","['Kang H', 'Wilson CS', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IM', 'Murphy MH', 'Atlas SR', 'Bedrick EJ', 'Devidas M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Robinson BW', 'Stam RW', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pieters R', 'Heerema NA', 'Hilden JM', 'Felix CA', 'Reaman GH', 'Camitta B', 'Winick N', 'Carroll WL', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Hunger SP', 'Willman CL']","['University of New Mexico Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111230,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IRX2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TACC2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46045-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-382861 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 23;119(8):1872-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-382861.

Tet1 is robustly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and has been implicated in mESC maintenance. Here we demonstrate that, unlike genetic deletion, RNAi-mediated depletion of Tet1 in mESCs led to a significant reduction in 5hmC and loss of mESC identity. The differentiation phenotype due to Tet1 depletion positively correlated with the extent of 5hmC loss. Meta-analyses of genomic data sets suggested interaction between Tet1 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling. LIF signaling is known to promote self-renewal and pluripotency in mESCs partly by opposing MAPK/ERK-mediated differentiation. Withdrawal of LIF leads to differentiation of mESCs. We discovered that Tet1 depletion impaired LIF-dependent Stat3-mediated gene activation by affecting Stat3's ability to bind to its target sites on chromatin. Nanog overexpression or inhibition of MAPK/ERK signaling, both known to maintain mESCs in the absence of LIF, rescued Tet1 depletion, further supporting the dependence of LIF/Stat3 signaling on Tet1. These data support the conclusion that analysis of mESCs in the hours/days immediately following efficient Tet1 depletion reveals Tet1's normal physiological role in maintaining the pluripotent state that may be subject to homeostatic compensation in genetic models.","['Freudenberg, Johannes M', 'Ghosh, Swati', 'Lackford, Brad L', 'Yellaboina, Sailu', 'Zheng, Xiaofeng', 'Li, Ruifang', 'Cuddapah, Suresh', 'Wade, Paul A', 'Hu, Guang', 'Jothi, Raja']","['Freudenberg JM', 'Ghosh S', 'Lackford BL', 'Yellaboina S', 'Zheng X', 'Li R', 'Cuddapah S', 'Wade PA', 'Hu G', 'Jothi R']","['Systems Biology Section, Biostatistics Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), 111 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111230,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (TET1 protein, mouse)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr1253 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr1253 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Apr;40(8):3364-77. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr1253.

Understanding the relationships between CSC dynamics and cancer progression may contribute to improvements in cancer treatment. Analysis of a simple discrete mathematical model has suggested that homeostasis in developing tissues is governed by a ""quorum sensing"" control mechanism, in which stem cells differentiate or proliferate according to feedback they receive from neighboring cell populations. Further analysis of the same model has indicated that excessive stem cell proliferation leading to malignant transformation mainly results from altered sensitivity to such micro-environmental signals. Our aim in this work is to expand the analysis to the dynamics of established populations of cancer cells and to examine possible therapeutic avenues for eliminating CSCs. The proposed model considers two populations of cells: CSCs, which can divide indefinitely, and differentiated cancer cells, which do not divide and have a limited lifespan. We assume that total cell density has negative feedback on CSC proliferation and that high CSC density activates CSC differentiation. We show that neither stimulation of CSC differentiation nor inhibition of CSC proliferation alone is sufficient for complete CSC elimination and cancer cure, since each of these two therapies affects a different subpopulation of CSCs. However, a combination of these two strategies can substantially reduce the population sizes and densities of all types of cancer cells. Therefore, we propose that in clinical trials, CSC differentiation therapy should only be examined in combination with chemotherapy. Our conclusions are corroborated by clinical experience with differentiating agents in acute promyelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma.","['Vainstein, Vladimir', 'Kirnasovsky, Oleg U', 'Kogan, Yuri', 'Agur, Zvia']","['Vainstein V', 'Kirnasovsky OU', 'Kogan Y', 'Agur Z']","[""Institute for Medical Biomathematics, 10 Te'ena str, P.O.B. 282, 60991 Bene Ataroth, Israel. vladimir.dr@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111223,England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Disease Progression', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stochastic Processes']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5193(11)00633-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2012 Apr 7;298:32-41. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.016.

It causes significant economic losses associated with the costs of control and eradication programs due to carcass condemnation at slaughter and restrictions of export of cattle and semen to importing countries. The main objective of this research was to determine the seroprevalence of BLV infection in cattle herds in central region of Iran (Isfahan province) using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect serum antibodies against BLV. Samples of blood serum were collected from 403 female dairy cattle (Holstein-Friesian) from 21 livestock farms and 303 animals (81.9%) were BLV seropositive. A significant association was found between age as a potential risk factor and BVL seroprevalence with animals >/= 4 years (86.6%) having a significantly (chi(2) = 35.6, p < 0.001) higher seroprevalence compared to those < 4 years (54.2%). We found no significant statistical association between seroprevalence and pregnancy, lactation status and farming systems as potential risk factors in this study (p > 0.1). It is concluded that BLV infection is a very common problem in the study area. Hence, control measures should be instituted to combat the disease and further studies are required to investigate the impact of this disease on dairy production in the country.","['Morovati, Hassan', 'Shirvani, Edris', 'Noaman, Vahid', 'Lotfi, Mohsen', 'Kamalzadeh, Morteza', 'Hatami, Alireza', 'Bahreyari, Masoume', 'Shahramyar, Zahra', 'Morovati, Mohammad H', 'Azimi, Mahmoud', 'Sakhaei, Davoud']","['Morovati H', 'Shirvani E', 'Noaman V', 'Lotfi M', 'Kamalzadeh M', 'Hatami A', 'Bahreyari M', 'Shahramyar Z', 'Morovati MH', 'Azimi M', 'Sakhaei D']","['Quality Control Management, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, PO Box 311975-148, Karaj, Iran. h.morovati@rvsri.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111231,United States,Trop Anim Health Prod,Tropical animal health and production,1277355,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Iran/epidemiology', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Pregnancy', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11250-011-0062-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Anim Health Prod. 2012 Aug;44(6):1127-9. doi: 10.1007/s11250-011-0062-4.

In addition, the in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities were evaluated. Despite the small effect on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), sophoflavescenol showed cytotoxicity against human leukaemia (HL-60), Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) cells. Interestingly, it also exerted potent in vivo antitumor activity by tumor growth inhibition in the LLC tumor model as well as apoptotic activity by caspase-3 activation in HL-60 cells. In addition, it exhibited potent antioxidant activities in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radicals and lipid peroxidation assays. Sophoflavescenol exerted notable anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nitric oxide generation and tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced ROS generation rather than inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells. The findings show that the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic activities of sophoflavescenol might contribute to the antitumor activity without severe side effects, highlighting its potential for chemoprevention and/or anticancer drugs due to multi-effective targets in almost all stages of tumorigenesis, including initiation, promotion, and progression.","['Jung, Hyun Ah', 'Jin, Seong Eun', 'Choi, Ran Joo', 'Manh, Hung Tran', 'Kim, Yeong Shik', 'Min, Byung-Sun', 'Son, You Kyung', 'Ahn, Bo Ra', 'Kim, Byung-Woo', 'Sohn, Hee Sook', 'Choi, Jae Sue']","['Jung HA', 'Jin SE', 'Choi RJ', 'Manh HT', 'Kim YS', 'Min BS', 'Son YK', 'Ahn BR', 'Kim BW', 'Sohn HS', 'Choi JS']","['Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, 561-756, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111231,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (sophoflavescenol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Free Radical Scavengers/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Sophora/*chemistry']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-011-1212-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2011 Dec;34(12):2087-99. doi: 10.1007/s12272-011-1212-y.

However, the development of drug resistance always prevented its further use. It has been shown that miR-181a is associated with the clinical outcome of AML patients. Here, we investigated the possible role of miR-181a in AML Ara-C resistance. METHODS: miR-181a expression was measured by real-time PCR. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay. Protein expressions were measured by western blotting. Caspase activity was examined by fluorescence assay. RESULTS: We found that miR-181a expression was downregulated in the Ara-C-resistant cell line HL-60/Ara-C compared with its parental cell line HL-60. Overexpression of miR-181a in HL-60/Ara-C cells sensitized the cells to Ara-C treatment. Furthermore, Bcl-2 was confirmed as a direct miR-181a target by immunoblot analysis and reporter gene assays. Knockdown of Bcl-2 mimicked the effect of enforced miR-181a expression by reducing cell viability. In addition, the apoptosis pathway was activated by cytochrome C release and caspase 9/caspase 3 activation after miR-181a overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time demonstrated that downregulation of miR-181a and upregulation of Bcl-2 in leukaemia cells confer resistance to Ara-C-based therapy. These results suggest that restoration of miR-181a expression might provide a promising therapeutic in drug resistance of leukaemia.","['Bai, Haitao', 'Cao, Zhongwei', 'Deng, Chong', 'Zhou, Lili', 'Wang, Chun']","['Bai H', 'Cao Z', 'Deng C', 'Zhou L', 'Wang C']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai, China. baihaitao@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120101,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-011-1137-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Apr;138(4):595-602. doi: 10.1007/s00432-011-1137-3.

The probability of finding a donor was 58.2%, 70.3%, and 75.7% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The median time to find a donor was 1.8 months for CB and 3.5 months for UD. Of the 99 patients with a donor, 38.4% failed to undergo the transplant because of a relapse observed at a median of 4 months from the start of the search. In univariate analysis, absence of relapse during the search (p < 0.0001) and transplant (p = 0.004) showed a positive impact on long-term survival. In multivariate analysis, relapse during the search remained the key factor affecting survival (p < 0.0001). Since an extension of the search beyond 3 months enables only a slight increase in the probability of finding a donor compared to the increased risk of relapse, the time of the search should not exceed the 3-month time point. The simultaneous search for CB and UD increases the likelihood of performing a timely transplant.","['Iori, Anna Paola', 'Valle, Veronica', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Torelli, Giovanni Fernando', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Barberi, Walter', 'Ricci, Roberto', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Lucarelli, Barbarella', 'Screnci, Maria', 'Perrone, Maria Paola', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Natalino, Fiammetta', 'Perrone, Salvatore', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta', 'Arcese, William', 'Foa, Roberto']","['Iori AP', 'Valle V', 'Piciocchi A', 'Meloni G', 'Torelli GF', 'Vitale A', 'Testi AM', 'Barberi W', 'Ricci R', 'Milano F', 'Lucarelli B', 'Screnci M', 'Perrone MP', 'Laurenti L', 'Natalino F', 'Perrone S', 'Sacchi N', 'Arcese W', 'Foa R']","['Department of Hematology, Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. iori@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20120103,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Histocompatibility Testing/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Volunteers', 'Young Adult']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2011/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1392-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jun;91(6):941-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1392-z.

Treatment recommendations are provided by an expert panel. Allogeneic SCT is recommended for children who: are in second complete remission (CR2) after experiencing an early marrow relapse for precursor-B ALL; experienced primary induction failure, but subsequently achieved a CR1; have T-lineage ALL in CR2; or have ALL in third or greater remission. Although the 2005 pediatric ALL evidence-based review (EBR) recommended allogeneic SCT for children with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL in CR1, preliminary tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) data demonstrate that early outcomes are comparable for allogeneic SCT and chemotherapy + imatinib. Based on the evidence, autologous SCT is not recommended for ALL in CR1. Allogeneic SCT is not recommended for: T-lineage ALL in CR1; mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)+ ALL when it is the sole adverse risk factor; isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse in precursor-B ALL. Based on expert opinion, allogeneic SCT may be considered for hypodiploid ALL and persistent minimal residual disease [corrected] (MRD) positivity in ALL in CR1 or greater, although these are areas that need further study.

Five AL-related miRNAs: miR-128, let-7b, miR-223, miR-181a and miR-155 expression were detected by qRT-PCR. Analysis showed that miRNA-128 expression was significantly higher in ALL (P<0.001).

Compared with normal controls, miR-128 expression was significantly higher in ALL (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in AML (P=0.900). The expressions of Let-7b and miR-223 in AL group were higher than in normal controls (P<0.001). MiR-181a was quantitatively detected in 107 AML patients, and we found that the expression of miR181a in M1 or M2 patients was significantly higher compared with it in M4 or M5 (P=0.013).

Immunoblot and flow cytometry analyses of these cell lines using an anti-human CCR9 monoclonal antibody revealed that CCR9 protein expression was detected only in GL-1, indicating the cross-reactivity of the antibody. Using the antibody, flow cytometry showed that the proportions of CCR9(+) cells were small (mean, 4.88%; SD, 2.15%) in the normal canine PBMCs.

One of the difficulties in treating cancer is that conventional chemotherapies often have unacceptable toxicities toward normal cells at the doses required to kill tumor cells. Thus, the demand for new and improved tumor specific therapeutics for the treatment of cancer remains high. Alterations to cellular metabolism constitute a nearly universal feature of many types of cancer cells. In particular, many tumors exhibit deficiencies in one or more amino acid synthesis or salvage pathways forcing a reliance on the extracellular pool of these amino acids to satisfy protein biosynthesis demands. Therefore, one treatment modality that satisfies the objective of developing cancer cell-selective therapeutics is the systemic depletion of that tumor-essential amino acid, which can result in tumor apoptosis with minimal side effects to normal cells. While this strategy was initially suggested over 50 years ago, it has been recently experiencing a renaissance owing to advances in protein engineering technology, and more sophisticated approaches to studying the metabolic differences between tumorigenic and normal cells. Dietary restriction is typically not sufficient to achieve a therapeutically relevant level of amino acid depletion for cancer treatment. Therefore, intravenous administration of enzymes is used to mediate the degradation of such amino acids for therapeutic purposes. Unfortunately, the human genome does not encode enzymes with the requisite catalytic or pharmacological properties necessary for therapeutic purposes. The use of heterologous enzymes has been explored extensively both in animal studies and in clinical trials. However, heterologous enzymes are immunogenic and elicit adverse responses ranging from anaphylactic shock to antibody-mediated enzyme inactivation, and therefore have had limited utility. The one notable exception is Escherichia colil-asparaginase II (EcAII), which has been FDA-approved for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The use of engineered human enzymes, to which natural tolerance is likely to prevent recognition by the adaptive immune system, offers a novel approach for capitalizing on the promising strategy of systemic depletion of tumor-essential amino acids. In this work, we review several strategies that we have developed to: (i) reduce the immunogenicity of a nonhuman enzyme, (ii) engineer human enzymes for novel catalytic specificities, and (iii) improve the pharmacological characteristics of a human enzyme that exhibits the requisite substrate specificity for amino acid degradation but exhibits low activity and stability under physiological conditions.","['Cantor, Jason R', 'Panayiotou, Vasiliki', 'Agnello, Giulia', 'Georgiou, George', 'Stone, Everett M']","['Cantor JR', 'Panayiotou V', 'Agnello G', 'Georgiou G', 'Stone EM']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*deficiency', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Computer Simulation', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Enzyme Therapy/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-416039-2.00015-X [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-416039-2.00015-X [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2012;502:291-319. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-416039-2.00015-X.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We previously developed a promoter that supports long-term, neuron-specific expression by fusing the chicken ss-globin insulator (INS), followed by an upstream enhancer from the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, to a neurofilament heavy gene (NFH) promoter. Here, we examined the capability of specific transcription factors to further improve long-term expression from this promoter. Following a HSV-1 virus infection, the virus genome is localized to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NB). At these sites, specific cellular transcription factors interact with HSV-1 encoded transcription factors, and together regulate HSV-1 gene expression. Importantly, lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), CLOCK, and Co-Rest each activate HSV-1 gene expression. However, gene expression from HSV-1 vectors differs in a number of important aspects from the virus, including no HSV-1 genes are expressed. Nonetheless, these observations raise the possibility that specific transcription factors may improve long-term expression from specific promoters in HSV-1 vectors. Here, we show that overexpression of either LSD1 or CLOCK improves long-term expression from the INS-TH-NFH promoter, but overexpression of Co-Rest supports levels of long-term expression similar to those supported by a control vector. Further, overexpression of LSD1 is compatible with neuron-specific expression. Thus, overexpressing specific transcription factors can improve long-term expression from specific cellular promoters in HSV-1 vectors, and the chromatin structure of the vector has an important role in enabling expression.","['Zhang, Guo-Rong', 'Zhao, Hua', 'Cao, Haiyan', 'Geller, Alfred I']","['Zhang GR', 'Zhao H', 'Cao H', 'Geller AI']","['Department of Neurology, West Roxbury VA Hospital/Harvard Medical School, W.

OBJECTIVE: To study the patterns of FLT3-ITD in Chinese patients with AML. DESIGN: A total of 207 patients with de novo AML were enrolled in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and polymerase chain reaction was performed. GeneScan was used to analyze the mutant to wild-type ratio. The sequencing of mutated genes was performed to confirm the mutation types and exclude false positives. RESULTS: A total of 42 cases (20.3%) were associated with mutations. FLT3-ITD was found equally in AML subtypes M1 to M6. The level of the ITD allele was heterogeneous. GeneScan showed that the mutant to wild-type ratio ranged from 0.03 to 3.78 (median, 0.43). Patients with a high ratio had significantly lower cancer remission rates and shorter survival. They also showed distinct clinical features including higher white blood cell counts and higher CD7 and CD56 expression. The length of the duplicated fragment was 26 to 57 bp (median, 43 bp). Twenty-two cases (52%) had simple tandem duplications, while 20 other cases (48%) had an extra interval of 12 to 30 bp before the tandem duplications. A hexanucleotide consisting of GAAAAG was found exclusively in the intervals. Patients with this GAAAAG interval showed better survival. The ITD to wild-type ratio, gene pattern, and CD7 expression status appear to be independent prognostic indices for patients with AML. CONCLUSION: Detection of FLT3 mutation is fast, easy, and inexpensive. The mutant to wild-type ratio is helpful for performing detailed risk stratification. DNA sequence analysis is more precise for confirming and evaluating the mutation pattern.","['Zhong, Ling', 'Jia, Yong Qian', 'Meng, Wen Tong', 'Ni, Xun']","['Zhong L', 'Jia YQ', 'Meng WT', 'Ni X']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, CD7/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*ethnology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/01/03 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2012/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2010-0700-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2012 Jan;136(1):84-9. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2010-0700-OA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intriguingly, we identified peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) as a novel potential tumor suppressor gene in AML. H3Ac was decreased at the PRDX2 gene promoter in AML, which correlated with low mRNA and protein expression. We also observed DNA hypermethylation at the PRDX2 promoter in AML. Low protein expression of the antioxidant PRDX2 gene was clinically associated with poor prognosis in patients with AML. Functionally, PRDX2 acted as inhibitor of myeloid cell growth by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in response to cytokines. Forced PRDX2 expression inhibited c-Myc-induced leukemogenesis in vivo on BM transplantation in mice. Taken together, epigenome-wide analyses of H3Ac in AML led to the identification of PRDX2 as an epigenetically silenced growth suppressor, suggesting a possible role of ROS in the malignant phenotype in AML.","['Agrawal-Singh, Shuchi', 'Isken, Fabienne', 'Agelopoulos, Konstantin', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Thoennissen, Nils H', 'Koehler, Gabriele', 'Hascher, Antje', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Becker, Anke', 'Schlenke, Peter', 'Wang, Yipeng', 'McClelland, Michael', 'Krug, Utz', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Yu, Dae-Yeul', 'Singh, Shailendra Vikram', 'Hansen, Klaus', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Agrawal-Singh S', 'Isken F', 'Agelopoulos K', 'Klein HU', 'Thoennissen NH', 'Koehler G', 'Hascher A', 'Baumer N', 'Berdel WE', 'Thiede C', 'Ehninger G', 'Becker A', 'Schlenke P', 'Wang Y', 'McClelland M', 'Krug U', 'Koschmieder S', 'Buchner T', 'Yu DY', 'Singh SV', 'Hansen K', 'Serve H', 'Dugas M', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology, and Oncology, University of Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111229,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Peroxiredoxins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45982-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-358705 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 8;119(10):2346-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-358705.

Molecular mechanisms for resistance of CML to tyrosine kinase inhibitors are not fully understood. In the present study, we show that BCR-ABL activates the expression of the mammalian stress response gene SIRT1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells and that this involves STAT5 signaling. SIRT1 activation promotes CML cell survival and proliferation associated with deacetylation of multiple SIRT1 substrates, including FOXO1, p53, and Ku70. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity partially reduces SIRT1 expression and SIRT1 inhibition further sensitizes CML cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis. Knockout of SIRT1 suppresses BCR-ABL transformation of mouse BM cells and the development of a CML-like myeloproliferative disease, and treatment of mice with the SIRT1 inhibitor tenovin-6 deters disease progression. The combination of SIRT1 gene knockout and imatinib treatment further extends the survival of CML mice. Our results suggest that SIRT1 is a novel survival pathway activated by BCR-ABL expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells, which promotes oncogenic transformation and leukemogenesis. Our findings suggest further exploration of SIRT1 as a therapeutic target for CML treatment to overcome resistance.","['Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Li, Ling', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Modi, Hardik', 'Horne, David', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Chen, WenYong']","['Yuan H', 'Wang Z', 'Li L', 'Zhang H', 'Modi H', 'Horne D', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen W']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111229,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46050-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-361691 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 23;119(8):1904-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-361691.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study the predictive value of OCT-1 activity in patients treated with imatinib 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day was evaluated in relation to trough imatinib plasma levels assessed in 100 patients enrolled in the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Optimization and Selectivity (TOPS) trial. RESULTS: The rate of major molecular responses by 24 months in patients on imatinib 400 mg/day was significantly higher in those with high OCT-1 activity than in those with low OCT-1 activity (low OCT-1 activity, 57% of patients; high OCT-1 activity, 100%; P < 0.001); the corresponding difference in patients treated with imatinib 800 mg/day did not reach statistical significance (low OCT-1 activity, 68%; high OCT-1 activity, 95%; P = 0.073). In addition, the combination of low trough imatinib levels (< 1200 ng/mL) and low OCT-1 activity defined a group of patients who had the lowest rates of major molecular response (47%) by 24 months compared to all other patients (81%, P = 0.009). These patients were also at the highest risk of failed imatinib therapy when compared to all other patients (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose imatinib leads to superior molecular responses in patients with low OCT-1 activity. In this group trough imatinib levels may define a group with inferior outcomes. Among patients with high OCT-1 activity, neither higher imatinib dose nor monitoring imatinib trough levels was found to be of significant clinical value. Hence OCT-1 activity determined prior to the start of therapy in newly diagnosed CML patients provides a valuable prognostic tool to determine the optimal up-front dose of imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.","['White, Deborah L', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Frede, Amity K', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Lin, Peter', 'Mongay, Lidia', 'Woodman, Richard', 'Manley, Paul', 'Slader, Cassandra', 'Kim, Dong Wook', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['White DL', 'Radich J', 'Soverini S', 'Saunders VA', 'Frede AK', 'Dang P', 'Cilloni D', 'Lin P', 'Mongay L', 'Woodman R', 'Manley P', 'Slader C', 'Kim DW', 'Pane F', 'Martinelli G', 'Saglio G', 'Hughes TP']","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, RAH Campus, Adelaide, Australia. deborah.white@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20111229,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/31 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.056457 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.056457 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):907-14. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.056457.

We hypothesize that interactions with endothelial cells in infiltrated tissues and during recirculation may have a pathogenic role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated apoptosis of leukemic cells after co-culture on a monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with addition of fludarabine and antibodies that block adhesion. Then, we compared microarray-based gene expression profiles between leukemic cells at baseline and after co-culture. RESULTS: We found that the endothelial layer protected leukemic cells from apoptosis inducing a 2-fold mean decrement in apoptotic cells after 2 days of co-culture. Moreover, the endothelial layer decreased the sensitivity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells to fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Physical contact with endothelium mediated by both beta(1)- and beta(2)- integrins is essential for the survival advantage of leukemic cells. In particular, blocking CD106 on endothelial cells or CD18 on leukemic B cells led to the almost complete abrogation of the survival advantage (>70% inhibition of viability). However, a reduction of apoptosis was also measured in leukemic cells cultured in conditioned medium collected after 2 days of co-culture, implying that survival is partially mediated by soluble factors. Overall, the contact with endothelial cells modulated 1,944 genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells, establishing a peculiar gene expression profile: up-regulation of angiogenesis-related genes, an increase of genes involved in TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways, secretion of cytokines recruiting stromal cells and macrophages and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl2 and Survivin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the notion that endothelial cells are major players in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia microenvironment. Adhesion to endothelium strongly supports survival, protects from drug-induced apoptosis and extensively modifies the gene expression profile of leukemic cells.","['Maffei, Rossana', 'Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Bulgarelli, Jenny', 'Martinelli, Silvia', 'Castelli, Ilaria', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Debbia, Giulia', 'Fontana, Marcella', 'Coluccio, Valeria', 'Bonacorsi, Goretta', 'Zucchini, Patrizia', 'Narni, Franco', 'Torelli, Giuseppe', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Marasca, Roberto']","['Maffei R', 'Fiorcari S', 'Bulgarelli J', 'Martinelli S', 'Castelli I', 'Deaglio S', 'Debbia G', 'Fontana M', 'Coluccio V', 'Bonacorsi G', 'Zucchini P', 'Narni F', 'Torelli G', 'Luppi M', 'Marasca R']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Oncology, Hematology and Respiratory Diseases, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111229,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2011/12/31 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.054924 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.054924 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):952-60. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.054924.

Early B-lymphocyte precursors of multiple myeloma are known to exist and might be susceptible to antigenic drive. DESIGN AND METHODS: To verify this hypothesis, we collected a database of 345 fully readable multiple myeloma immunoglobulin sequences. We characterized the immunoglobulin repertoire, analyzed the somatic hypermutation load, and investigated for stereotyped receptor clusters. RESULTS: Compared to the normal immunoglobulin repertoire, multiple myeloma displayed only modest differences involving only a few genes, showing that the myeloma immunoglobulin repertoire is the least skewed among mature B-cell tumors. Median somatic hypermutation load was 7.8%; median length of complementarity determining-region 3 was 15.5 amino acids. Clustering analysis showed the absence of myeloma specific clusters and no similarity with published chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma subsets.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we evaluated whether nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase's effects on aberrant proliferation and survival of myeloid leukemic cells are dependent on sirtuin and delineated the downstream signaling pathways operating during this process. RESULTS: We identified significant upregulation of sirtuin 2 and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase levels in primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts compared to in hematopoietic progenitor cells from healthy individuals. Importantly, specific inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase or sirtuin 2 significantly reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary blasts. Intriguingly, we found that protein kinase B/AKT could be deacetylated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and sirtuin 2. The anti-leukemic effects of the inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase or sirtuin 2 were accompanied by acetylation of protein kinase B/AKT with subsequent inhibition by dephosphorylation. This leads to activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta via diminished phosphorylation and, ultimately, inactivation of beta-catenin by phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and sirtuin 2 participate in the aberrant proliferation and survival of leukemic cells, and suggest that the protein kinase B/AKT/ glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway is a target for inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase or sirtuin 2 and, thereby, leukemia cell proliferation.","['Dan, Lan', 'Klimenkova, Olga', 'Klimiankou, Maxim', 'Klusman, Jan-Henning', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Welte, Karl', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Dan L', 'Klimenkova O', 'Klimiankou M', 'Klusman JH', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Reinhardt D', 'Welte K', 'Skokowa J']","['Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111229,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AC 93253)', '0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.055236 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.055236 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Apr;97(4):551-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.055236.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 457 adults with precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our hospital identified 44 (9.6%) patients with prior malignancies. The clinical and genetic characteristics of this group of patients was compared with those of their counterparts with de novo disease and the relationship with prior chemoradiation therapy was assessed. RESULTS: Thirty of 44(6.2%) patients received cytotoxic therapies, whereas 14 patients did not. The former group showed a significantly shorter interval from prior malignancy to onset of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36 versus 144 months; P = 0.002). Compared with 413 de novo cases, the frequencies of t(4;11)(q21;q23) (P<0.001) and hypodiploidy (P = 0.009) with loss of chromosome 5, 7 or 17 were significantly higher in patients who received topoisomerase II inhibitor and/or alkylating agents. By contrast, Philadelphia-positive and normal karyotype were more frequent in patients who either did not receive chemotherapy or received only local radiation or nucleoside analogs. Patients with precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia following prior malignancies and chemoradiation were older, had a lower complete remission rate and showed an inferior survival in univariate, but not multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the interpretation that therapy-related precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia does occur. In particular, cases associated with t(4;11)(q21;q23) or hypodiploidy with -5, -7, -17 are likely to be therapy-related and have a poor prognosis. The inferior outcome of these patients may be attributable to the high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities that are found in this group of patients.","['Tang, Guilin', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Lin, Pei', 'Liu, Dingsheng', 'Hu, Ying', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Tang G', 'Zuo Z', 'Thomas DA', 'Lin P', 'Liu D', 'Hu Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111229,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2011/12/31 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.057752 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.057752 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):919-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.057752.

We demonstrate that robust and selective expression of the receptor for the adipocyte-derived peptide hormone leptin (OB-R) is a characteristic feature of TISCs and of a broad array of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells and is mediated directly by the core pluripotency-associated transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2. TISCs exhibit sensitized responses to leptin, including the phosphorylation and activation of the pluripotency-associated oncogene STAT3 and induction of Oct4 and Sox2, thereby establishing a self-reinforcing signaling module. Exposure of cultured mouse embryonic stem cells to leptin sustains pluripotency in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. By implanting TISCs into leptin-deficient ob/ob mice or into comparably overweight Lepr(db/db) mice that produce leptin, we provide evidence of a central role for the leptin-TISC-signaling axis in promoting obesity-induced tumor growth. Differential responses to extrinsic, adipocyte-derived cues may promote the expansion of tumor cell subpopulations and contribute to oncogenesis.","['Feldman, Douglas Edmund', 'Chen, Chialin', 'Punj, Vasu', 'Tsukamoto, Hidekazu', 'Machida, Keigo']","['Feldman DE', 'Chen C', 'Punj V', 'Tsukamoto H', 'Machida K']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. defeldma@usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111229,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*pathology', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leptin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Obesity/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin/*metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/03/22 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1114438109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1114438109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jan 17;109(3):829-34. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1114438109.

METHODS: Nilotinib was given at 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Serum concentration data (sparse and full pharmacokinetic profiles) were obtained from 542 patients over 12 months. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. Exposure-response relationships were explored graphically or using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Nilotinib concentrations were stable over 12 months. Patients in the 400 mg twice-daily arm had an 11.5% higher exposure than did those in the 300 mg twice-daily arm, and the relative bioavailability of nilotinib 400 mg twice daily was 0.84 times that of 300 mg twice daily. Patient demographics did not significantly affect nilotinib pharmacokinetics. The occurrence of all-grade total bilirubin elevation was significantly higher in patients with higher nilotinib exposure, and a positive correlation was also observed between nilotinib exposure and QTcF change on electrocardiograms from baseline. There was no significant relationship between nilotinib exposure and major molecular response at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: There is a less than proportional dose-exposure relationship between nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg twice-daily doses. Blood level testing is unlikely to play an important role in the general management of patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with nilotinib.","['Larson, Richard A', 'Yin, Ophelia Q P', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Gallagher, Neil J', 'Demirhan, Eren', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'le Coutre, Philipp D']","['Larson RA', 'Yin OQ', 'Hochhaus A', 'Saglio G', 'Clark RE', 'Nakamae H', 'Gallagher NJ', 'Demirhan E', 'Hughes TP', 'Kantarjian HM', 'le Coutre PD']","['University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111230,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-011-1200-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 May;68(5):723-33. doi: 10.1007/s00228-011-1200-7.

We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to compare the constitutive promoter methylation of BRCA1 and several other tumor suppressor genes in primary fibroblasts. The affected twin displayed an increased BRCA1 methylation (12%), compared with her sister (3%). Subsequent bisulfite plasmid sequencing demonstrated that 13% (6 of 47) BRCA1 alleles were fully methylated in the affected twin, whereas her sister displayed only single CpG errors without functional implications. This between-twin methylation difference was also found in irradiated fibroblasts and untreated saliva cells. The BRCA1 epimutation may have originated by an early somatic event in the affected twin: approximately 25% of her body cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages carry one epigenetically inactivated BRCA1 allele. This epimutation was associated with reduced basal protein levels and a higher induction of BRCA1 after DNA damage. In addition, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of both sisters and found several copy number variations, i.e., heterozygous deletion and reduced expression of the RSPO3 gene in the affected twin.

Treatment is prolonged and complex; and as survival rates plateau, factors relating to socio-economic status and/or treatment adherence are increasingly scrutinised as potentially important determinants of outcome. METHODS: Predicated on the frame-work of the United Kingdom (UK) NHS, the relationship between socio-demographic factors and ALL survival is examined here using data from a large follow-up study conducted in the 1990s. One thousand five hundred and fifty nine children (0-14 years) diagnosed in England, Scotland &Wales during the era of the national UKALL XI randomized-controlled trial (RCT) were followed-up for an average of 15.9 years (20,826.3 person-years). Area-based deprivation scores and father's occupational social class at the time of the child's birth were used as markers of socio-economic status. Information on deaths was obtained from the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care. All children were included in the analyses, irrespective of RCT enrolment or participation in the founding epidemiological study (www.UKCCS.org).Survival effects were assessed using proportional hazards regressions models. RESULTS: Survival varied with both area-based deprivation at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.57) and fathers occupational social class at birth (HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.97-1.29); the divergence beginning 6-9 months after diagnosis, and widening thereafter during home-administered therapy. The findings became more marked when analyses were restricted to those enrolled in UKALL XI (n = 1341). As expected, survival differences were also observed with sex, and age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The existence of significant social disparities in ALL survival, which are not due to treatment accessibility, is of major clinical importance. Trends should be monitored and further research into potentially modifiable risk factors conducted.","['Lightfoot, T J', 'Johnston, W T', 'Simpson, J', 'Smith, A G', 'Ansell, P', 'Crouch, S', 'Roman, E', 'Kinsey, S E']","['Lightfoot TJ', 'Johnston WT', 'Simpson J', 'Smith AG', 'Ansell P', 'Crouch S', 'Roman E', 'Kinsey SE']","['Epidemiology & Genetics Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom. tracy.lightfoot@egu.york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2011/12/31 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00794-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Jan;48(2):263-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.10.007.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The first-line therapies, interferon-? and glatiramer acetate, have well-established efficacy and present no major safety concerns. Certain second-line therapies, such as natalizumab, offer potentially greater efficacy, but are associated with an increased level of risk. Over the last year, the first two oral treatments of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, cladribine and fingolimod, have been marketed in certain countries, although cladribine was subsequently withdrawn. In the Phase III clinical development programme, both drugs appeared effective and reasonably safe. However, there were cases of serious adverse events (malignancies and fatal infections) whose relationship with treatment was unclear. Specific postmarketing studies will be necessary to assess the risks of these new oral therapies. Indeed, both natalizumab and mitoxantrone are known today to be associated with rare adverse drug reactions (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy for natalizumab and treatment-related leukaemia for mitoxantrone), which were not identified before the treatments were approved. The use of therapies carrying potential serious risks is justified in patients who cannot be treated effectively with safe first-line therapies, but probably not in the average relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or clinical isolated syndrome patient. Pivotal Phase III clinical trials, on which basis drug approval is generally granted, are designed to demonstrate clinical efficacy and reveal frequently occurring adverse effects of a new drug. However, post-approval trials with extensive patient exposure are needed to generate knowledge of more patient-specific clinical effectiveness and long-term safety, in particular with respect to rare adverse reactions. Other post-approval measures, such as risk management programmes, pharmacovigilance studies, or phased launch of the drug, may be useful to ensure that risks associated with new treatments are identified and minimised. The final evaluation of the benefits to risks balance of a drug should be made in every patient by weighing benefits in disease activity and progression, quality of life and health economy against both commonly occurring mild side-effects and rare potentially life-threatening adverse drug effects. This decision should be shared between the physician and patient, who may not share the same perceptions of acceptable risk.","['Sorensen, Per Soelberg']",['Sorensen PS'],"['Danish Multiple Sclerosis Research Centre, Copenhagen University and Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Natalizumab)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '5M691HL4BO (Glatiramer Acetate)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Glatiramer Acetate', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/therapeutic use', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy', 'Natalizumab', 'Peptides/therapeutic use', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Propylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sphingosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2011/12/31 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2011/12/31 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-510X(11)70006-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0022-510X(11)70006-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 2011 Dec;311 Suppl 1:S29-34. doi: 10.1016/S0022-510X(11)70006-5.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A large variety of cellular processes, including differentiation, development, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, are dependent on miRNA-mediated suppression of gene expression for their regulation. As such, it is unsurprising that these small RNA molecules are associated with signaling networks that are often altered in various diseases, including many blood cancers. One such network is the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways that universally stimulate transcription of proteins which generally promote cell survival, inhibit apoptosis, allow cellular growth, induce angiogenesis and generate many pro-inflammatory responses. The NF-kappaB signalling pathway is often constitutively activated in blood cell cancers including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), lymphomas and in multiple myeloma (MM). This review focuses on the function of miRNAs that directly target NF-kappaB signaling cascade. Recent findings that connect this pathway through various miRNA families to human blood cancers are reviewed, and support for using miRNA-based therapy as a novel method to counteract this tumour-promoting signalling event is discussed.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Murray, Megan Y', 'Barrera, Lawrence N', 'Heasman, Sally-Anne', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Macewan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Murray MY', 'Barrera LN', 'Heasman SA', 'Zaitseva L', 'Macewan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111121,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,2011/12/30 06:00,2011/12/30 06:01,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2012;2(1):65-74.

One PCR reagent, Platinum Taq polymerase (pol) has been reported to contain mouse DNA that produces false-positive MLV PCR results. We report here the finding of a large number of PCR reagents that have low levels of MLV sequences. We found that recombinant reverse-transcriptase (RT) enzymes from six companies derived from either MLV or avian myeloblastosis virus contained MLV pol DNA sequences but not gag or mouse DNA sequences. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed high relatedness to Moloney MLV, suggesting residual contamination with an RT-containing plasmid. In addition, we identified contamination with mouse DNA and a variety of MLV sequences in commercially available human DNAs from leukocytes, brain tissues, and cell lines. These results identify new sources of MLV contamination and highlight the importance of careful pre-screening of commercial specimens and diagnostic reagents to avoid false-positive MLV PCR results.","['Zheng, HaoQiang', 'Jia, Hongwei', 'Shankar, Anupama', 'Heneine, Walid', 'Switzer, William M']","['Zheng H', 'Jia H', 'Shankar A', 'Heneine W', 'Switzer WM']","['Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Contamination', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029050 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19419 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29050. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029050.

In the SAT-TB assay, a 170-bp M. tuberculosis 16S rRNA fragment is reverse transcribed to DNA by use of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase, using specific primers incorporating the T7 promoter sequence, and undergoes successive cycles of amplification using T7 RNA polymerase. Using a real-time PCR instrument, hybridization of an internal 6-carboxyfluorescein-4-[4-(dimethylamino)phenylazo] benzoic acid N-succinimidyl ester (FAM-DABCYL)-labeled fluorescent probe can be used to detect RNA amplification. The SAT-TB assay takes less than 1.5 h to perform, and the sensitivity of the assay for detection of M. tuberculosis H37Rv is 100 CFU/ml. The TB probe has no cross-reactivity with nontuberculous mycobacteria or other common respiratory tract pathogens. For 253 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) specimens and 134 non-TB specimens, the SAT-TB results correlated with 95.6% (370/387 specimens) of the Bactec MGIT 960 culture assay results. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the SAT-TB test for the diagnosis of PTB were 67.6%, 100%, 100%, and 62.0%, respectively, compared to 61.7%, 100%, 100%, and 58.0% for Bactec MGIT 960 culture. For PTB diagnosis, the sensitivities of the SAT-TB and Bactec MGIT 960 culture methods were 97.6% and 95.9%, respectively, for smear-positive specimens and 39.2% and 30.2%, respectively, for smear-negative specimens. In conclusion, the SAT-TB assay is a novel, simple test with a high specificity which may enhance the detection rate of TB.

No field cases of ALV-J infection or tumors in layer chickens were observed worldwide until 2004. However, layer flocks in China have experienced outbreaks of this virus in recent years. The molecular epidemiology of ALV-J strains isolated from layer flocks was investigated. The env genes of 77.8% (21/27) of the ALV-J layer isolates with a high degree of genetic variation were significantly different from the env genes of the prototype strain of ALV-J (HPRS-103) and American and Chinese strains from meat-type chickens (designated ALV-J broiler isolates). A total of 205 nucleotides were deleted from the 3' untranslated region of 89.5% (17/19) of the ALV-J layer isolates. Approximately 94.7% (16/17) of the layer isolates contained a complete E element of 146 to 149 residues. The U3 sequences of 84.2% (16/19) of the ALV-J layer isolates displayed less than 92.5% sequence homology to those of the ALV-J broiler isolates, although the transcriptional regulatory elements that are typical of avian retroviruses were highly conserved. Several unique nucleotide substitutions in the env gene, the U3 region, and the E element of most of the ALV-J layer isolates were detected. These results suggested that the env gene, E element, and U3 region in the ALV-J layer isolates have evolved rapidly and were significantly different from those of the ALV-J broiler isolates. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of layer tumor diseases induced by ALV-J.","['Gao, Yulong', 'Yun, Bingling', 'Qin, Liting', 'Pan, Wei', 'Qu, Yue', 'Liu, Zaisi', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Gao Y', 'Yun B', 'Qin L', 'Pan W', 'Qu Y', 'Liu Z', 'Wang Y', 'Qi X', 'Gao H', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State [corrected] Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120111,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCM.06179-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.06179-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2012 Mar;50(3):953-60. doi: 10.1128/JCM.06179-11.

Here we show that the E4 gene product, E4orf3 can, independently of E1B-55K and E4orf6, target the transcriptional corepressor transcriptional intermediary factor 1gamma (TIF1gamma) for proteasome-mediated degradation during infection. Initial mass spectrometric studies identified TIF1 family members-TIF1alpha, TIF1beta, and TIF1gamma-as E1B-55K-binding proteins in both transformed and infected cells, but analyses revealed that, akin to TIF1alpha, TIF1gamma is reorganized in an E4orf3-dependent manner to promyelocytic leukemia protein-containing nuclear tracks during infection. The use of a number of different adenovirus early region mutants identified the specific and sole requirement for E4orf3 in mediating TIF1gamma degradation. Further analyses revealed that TIF1gamma is targeted for degradation by a number of divergent human adenoviruses, suggesting that the ability of E4orf3 to regulate TIF1gamma expression is evolutionarily conserved. We also determined that E4orf3 does not utilize the Cullin-based ubiquitin ligases, CRL2 and CRL5, or the TIF1alpha ubiquitin ligase in order to promote TIF1gamma degradation. Further studies suggested that TIF1gamma possesses antiviral activity and limits adenovirus early and late gene product expression during infection. Indeed, TIF1gamma knockdown accelerates the adenovirus-mediated degradation of MRE11, while TIF1gamma overexpression delays the adenovirus-mediated degradation of MRE11. Taken together, these studies have identified novel adenovirus targets and have established a new role for the E4orf3 protein during infection.","['Forrester, Natalie A', 'Patel, Rakesh N', 'Speiseder, Thomas', 'Groitl, Peter', 'Sedgwick, Garry G', 'Shimwell, Neil J', 'Seed, Robert I', 'Catnaigh, Pol O', 'McCabe, Christopher J', 'Stewart, Grant S', 'Dobner, Thomas', 'Grand, Roger J A', 'Martin, Ashley', 'Turnell, Andrew S']","['Forrester NA', 'Patel RN', 'Speiseder T', 'Groitl P', 'Sedgwick GG', 'Shimwell NJ', 'Seed RI', 'Catnaigh PO', 'McCabe CJ', 'Stewart GS', 'Dobner T', 'Grand RJ', 'Martin A', 'Turnell AS']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UnitedKingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111228,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (E4orf3 protein, adenovirus)', '0 (TRIM33 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae Infections/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06583-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06583-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3167-79. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06583-11.

This paper describes two cases of APL associated with the PLZF-RARA fusion gene enrolled in the IC-APL trial that is a non-randomized, multicenter study conducted in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Uruguay with the aim to improve the treatment outcome of APL patients in developing countries. These cases, although rare, offer a challenge to its early recognition and proper conduction.","['Rohr, Sandra S', 'Pelloso, Luis Arthur Flores', 'Borgo, Aline', 'De Nadai, Livia Chiosini', 'Yamamoto, Mihoko', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'de Lourdes L F Chauffaille, Maria']","['Rohr SS', 'Pelloso LA', 'Borgo A', 'De Nadai LC', 'Yamamoto M', 'Rego EM', 'de Lourdes L F Chauffaille M']","['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, UNIFESP, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Rua Botucatu, 740-3.andar, Sao Paulo, SP, CEP 04023-900, Brazil. sandra.rohr@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111229,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/30 06:00,2013/07/28 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0147-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Dec;29(4):2345-7. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0147-y.

Using a panel of ALL cell lines, the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of DMF varied between 2.8 and 7.0 mug/ml. DMF induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, concomitant with a decreased expression of phosphorylated retinoblastoma-associated protein 1. DMF increased the rate of apoptosis, although it was apparent only after a long period of exposure (96 h). The accumulation of oxidative stress was not involved in the growth-inhibitory effects of DMF. As DMF reduced the intracellular levels of glutathione, the combination effects of DMF with other anticancer drugs were evaluated using the improved Isobologram and the combination index method. In the simultaneous drug combination assay, DMF antagonized the cytotoxicity of 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, and L-asparaginase in all tested ALL cells. This study demonstrated that DMF, a methylated flavone, was an effective chemotherapy agent that could inhibit cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis in ALL cell lines. However, combination therapy with DMF and other anticancer drugs is not recommended.","['Goto, Hiroaki', 'Yanagimachi, Masakatsu', 'Goto, Shoko', 'Takeuchi, Masanobu', 'Kato, Hiromi', 'Yokosuka, Tomoko', 'Kajiwara, Ryosuke', 'Yokota, Shumpei']","['Goto H', 'Yanagimachi M', 'Goto S', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kato H', 'Yokosuka T', 'Kajiwara R', 'Yokota S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan. hgoto39@med.yokohama-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '21392-57-4 (5,7-dimethoxyflavone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834fb731 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Apr;23(4):417-25. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834fb731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that at a high NADPH concentration (500 mumol/l), the anthracenedione agent ametantrone, with an unmodified quinone structure, was susceptible to CPR-dependent reductive activation. In contrast, it was shown that compounds with modified quinone grouping (benzoperimidine BP1, anthrapyridone CO1 and pyrazolopyrimidoacridine PPAC2) did not undergo reductive activation by CPR. This suggests that the presence of a modified quinone function is the structural factor excluding reductive activation of antitumour anthraquinone derivatives and analogues by CPR. In the second part of the work, the ability of antitumour anthraquinone derivatives and analogues to inhibit the growth of the human promyelocytic, sensitive leukaemia HL60 cell line as well as its MDR sublines exhibiting two different phenotypes of MDR related to the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (HL60/VINC) or MRP1 (HL60/DOX) was studied in the presence of exogenously added CPR. A significant increase in the activity of ametantrone with an unmodified quinone structure after its reductive conversion by CPR was observed against HL60 as well as HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX cells, whereas in the case of quinone-modified compounds (BP1, CO1 and PPAC2), the presence of the activation system had no effect on their activity against the sensitive and MDR tumour cells examined.","['Kostrzewa-Nowak, Dorota', 'Bieg, Bohdan', 'Paine, Mark J I', 'Wolf, C Roland', 'Tarasiuk, Jolanta']","['Kostrzewa-Nowak D', 'Bieg B', 'Paine MJ', 'Wolf CR', 'Tarasiuk J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (anthrapyridone CO1)', '0 (benzoperimidine BP1)', '0 (pyrazolopyrimidoacridine PPAC2)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'PNT6041ST1 (ametantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/*metabolism']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834fcf4f [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Apr;23(4):393-405. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834fcf4f.,['10822/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the characteristics of 21 patients with CLL and nine patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), diagnosed in multiple centers (n = 13), which showed an MYC translocation demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The prevalence was estimated to be <1%. Advanced age and male predominance were observed. Morphological analysis frequently revealed the presence of prolymphocytes. A typical ""CLL-immunophenotype"" was found in four of nine cases with PLL. Moreover, CD5 and CD23 were frequently expressed in PLL. The latter findings are atypical for PLL and may suggest transformation or progression of an underlying CLL. MYC translocations were frequently observed with concomitant adverse cytogenetic markers, such as del(11q) (n = 8/30) and/or del(17p)/monosomy 17 (n = 7/30). In addition, the presence of unbalanced translocations (n = 24 in 13/30 cases) and complex karyotype (n = 16/30) were frequent in cases with MYC translocations. Altogether, del(17p)/monosomy 17, del(11q), and/or complex karyotype were observed in 22 of 30 patients. Survival outcome was poor: the median time to treatment was only 5 months, and overall survival (OS) from clinical diagnosis and from genetic detection was 71 and 19 months, respectively. In conclusion, CLL/PLL with MYC translocations is a rare entity, which seems to be associated with adverse prognostic features and unfavorable outcome.","['Put, Natalie', 'Van Roosbroeck, Katrien', 'Konings, Peter', 'Meeus, Peter', 'Brusselmans, Caroline', 'Rack, Katrina', 'Gervais, Carine', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Barin, Carole', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Fert-Ferrer, Sandra', 'Laibe, Sophy', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Quilichini, Benoit', 'Poirel, Helene A', 'Wlodarska, Iwona', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Moreau, Yves', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Michaux, Lucienne']","['Put N', 'Van Roosbroeck K', 'Konings P', 'Meeus P', 'Brusselmans C', 'Rack K', 'Gervais C', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Chapiro E', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Struski S', 'Dastugue N', 'Gachard N', 'Lefebvre C', 'Barin C', 'Eclache V', 'Fert-Ferrer S', 'Laibe S', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Quilichini B', 'Poirel HA', 'Wlodarska I', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Moreau Y', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Michaux L']","['Center for Human Genetics, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111230,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1393-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jun;91(6):863-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1393-y.

In the past ten years, extensive work has led to the discovery of certain molecular abnormalities underlying a subset of these diseases. A significant minority of patients with clonal eosinophilia carry abnormal gene fusions involving PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1. These findings have been quite significant, as those individuals with a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion have an exquisite susceptibility to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate. Imatinib leads to a rapid remission in these patients and aborts the clinical trajectory of the disease. Unfortunately, TKIs have not been shown to be particularly active in the case of mastocytosis, although the majority of patients with mastocytosis carry a c-KIT alteration, a target of agents such as imatinib. The reason for this decreased sensitivity to TKIs is related to the resistance of the D816V variant of c-KIT, found in the majority of patients with mastocytosis. Nevertheless, investigation is ongoing to define new molecular lesions in these diseases, and potentially new targets for therapy. Clinical trials are also investigating other novel small molecules that may have efficacy against targets currently resistant to imatinib and other TKIs.","['Sadrzadeh, Hossein', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Sadrzadeh H', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Fathi AT']","['Center for Leukemia and the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Eosinophilia/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2011 Dec;12(67):481-93.,,,,,['(c) Discovery Medicine'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For that reason, we used a well established differentiation model system of human U937 myelocytic leukemia cells that differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA. Constant cannabinoid receptor (CB) stimulation was performed using WIN55212-2, a potent synthetic CB agonist. We found that WIN55212-2 inhibited CB1/2-receptor-dependent PMA-induced differentiation of human myelocytic U937 cells into the macrophageal phenotype, which was associated with impaired vimentin, ICAM-1 and CD11b expression. In the presence of WIN55212-2, cdc2 protein and mRNA expression was progressively enhanced and Tyr-15-phosporylation of cdc2 was reduced in differentiating U937 cells. Additionally, p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was up-regulated. PMA-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by WIN55212-2 and differentiation-associated c-jun expression was not altered. In conclusion, we suppose that WIN55212-2-induced signals interferes with cell-cycle-arrest-signaling in differentiating myelocytic cells and thus inhibits macrophageal differentiation. Thus, it is possible that the cannabinoid system is able to influence one of the key steps in the immune effector function, the monocytic-macrophageal differentiation by alteration of cell cycle control proteins cdc2 and p21, and is therefore representing a promising option for therapeutic intervention in exacerbated immune reactions.","['Paulsen, Katrin', 'Tauber, Svantje', 'Timm, Johanna', 'Goelz, Nadine', 'Dumrese, Claudia', 'Stolzing, Alexandra', 'Hass, Ralf', 'Ullrich, Oliver']","['Paulsen K', 'Tauber S', 'Timm J', 'Goelz N', 'Dumrese C', 'Stolzing A', 'Hass R', 'Ullrich O']","['Division of Cellbiology, Institute of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland. oliver.ullrich@anatom.uzh.ch.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111228,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,,,,2011/12/30 06:00,2011/12/30 06:01,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['1478-811X-9-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-9-33 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2011 Dec 28;9:33. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-9-33.,,PMC3273436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies on the activated tyrosine kinases have focused on proximal signaling events, but little is known about gene transcription regulated by these fusions. METHODS: Oligonucleotide microarray was performed to compare mRNA changes attributable to BCR-ABL, TEL-PDGFRB and TEL-JAK2 after 1 week of activation of each fusion in Ba/F3 cell lines. Imatinib was used to control the activation of BCR-ABL and TEL-PDGFRB, and TEL-JAK2-mediated gene expression was examined 1 week after Ba/F3-TEL-JAK2 cells were switched to factor-independent conditions. RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed between 800 to 2000 genes induced or suppressed by two-fold or greater by each tyrosine kinase, with a subset of these genes commonly induced or suppressed among the three fusions. Validation by Quantitative PCR confirmed that eight genes (Dok2, Mrvi1, Isg20, Id1, gp49b, Cxcl10, Scinderin, and collagen Valpha1(Col5a1)) displayed an overlapping regulation among the three tested fusion proteins. Stat1 and Gbp1 were induced uniquely by TEL-PDGFRB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that BCR-ABL, TEL-PDGFRB and TEL-JAK2 regulate distinct and overlapping gene transcription profiles. Many of the genes identified are known to be involved in processes associated with leukemogenesis, including cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. This study offers the basis for further work that could lead to an understanding of the specificity of diseases caused by these three chromosomal translocations.","['Kim, Hani', 'Gillis, Lisa C', 'Jarvis, Jordan D', 'Yang, Stuart', 'Huang, Kai', 'Der, Sandy', 'Barber, Dwayne L']","['Kim H', 'Gillis LC', 'Jarvis JD', 'Yang S', 'Huang K', 'Der S', 'Barber DL']","['Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111228,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/30 06:00,2012/04/26 06:00,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-528 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-528 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Dec 28;11:528. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-528.,['FRN 42428/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3295743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of tumor-related genes provides considerable insight into the biology of leukemias and opens the way to more specific pharmacological treatments. These genes comprise several ion channels and pumps, as the transport mechanisms associated with volume control, proliferation and apoptosis are often altered in cancers. In leukemic cells, such changes are observed as early as the stem cell stage. Ion channels can regulate other malignant features, such as lack of differentiation, increased migratory and invasive phenotype and chemoresistance. The role of certain voltage-gated K(+) channels, such as K(v)11.1 (also known as hERG1) can be largely attributed to modulation of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). K(v)11.1 exerts pleiotropic regulatory effects by forming multiprotein membrane complexes with integrin receptors in both acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). By recruiting growth factor and chemokine receptors, these complexes form signaling hubs that control neoplastic progression. Work in mice shows that blocking K(v)11.1 has a protective effect in acute leukemias. Ion channels are most promising targets for anti-leukemic therapy, because of their accessibility from the extracellular side and the thorough understanding of their pharmacology. In ALL cells, K(v)11.1 inhibitors abrogate the protective effect of bone marrow stromal cells and enhance the cytotoxicity of some common antileukemic drugs. Hence, ion channel modulators could overcome chemoresistance in acute leukemias, a major hindrance to therapeutic success.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Pillozzi, S', 'Becchetti, A']","['Arcangeli A', 'Pillozzi S', 'Becchetti A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Viale G.B.

METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study conducted at Paediatric Oncology department at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore Pakistan. All registered cases of ALL from 12 months to 18 years of age who expired between May 2001 to December 2005 were included. Mortality data was collected and analyzed regarding age, sex, WBC count, immunophenotype, treatment protocol, remission, and timing of death with respect to treatment protocol and the cause of death. RESULTS: Out of 304 new cases of ALL registered in the study period, 74 (24%) died during treatment. During induction 39 of 74 (52.7%) died, 33 (44.5%) in first remission and 2 (2.8%) before initiation of therapy. Infection alone or in combination with other factors was responsible for deaths in 63 of 74 (85%) cases. Septicemia, pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections were documented in 37/63 (58.7%), 44/63 (69%) and 8/63 (12.6%) cases respectively. Eight (10.8%) died due to haemorrhage. Three (4%) deaths were secondary to chemotherapy induced toxicity. CONCLUSION: Infection is the major cause of mortality in ALL patients in our study population.

We propose that assessment of femoral heads resected during total hip arthroplasty and donated for allograft use may provide a profile of femoral head pathology that benefits total hip arthroplasty patients and bone donors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the histological findings reported for 6161 femoral heads donated for allograft use between 1993 and 2006. Specimens obtained during total hip arthroplasty and specimens donated at death were reviewed. Follow-up investigations that resulted from abnormal histopathological findings were also reviewed. The Western Australian Cancer Registry was used to determine whether patients with a suspected neoplasm were subsequently diagnosed with such a disease. A retrospective review of the histopathological findings was conducted to evaluate and reclassify all previous observations of abnormalities. RESULTS: One hundred and five femoral heads demonstrated abnormal or reactive histopathological features not reported prior to surgery and were rejected for allograft use. A reactive lymphocytic infiltrate, most likely due to osteoarthritis, was the most commonly identified feature (forty-five cases). Other features observed in twenty-seven cases were also most likely due to the presence of severe osteoarthritis. Ten femoral heads demonstrated plasmacytosis, which may have been related to osteoarthritis. Two patients were diagnosed with Paget's disease, and two, with rheumatoid arthritis. Nineteen patients had a suspected neoplasm. Of these nineteen, eight cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and one case of myelodysplastic syndrome were confirmed on further investigation. One subsequently confirmed malignancy was detected per 770 femoral heads examined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that, even with a detailed medical history and careful physical examination, clinically important diseases including neoplasms and Paget's disease are observed in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis prior to total hip arthroplasty. Histological examination plays an integral role in quality assurance in femoral head banking, and it also represents a possible early diagnostic test for bone and bone-marrow-related diseases in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.","['Mackie, Katherine E', 'Zhou, Ziqiang', 'Robbins, Peter', 'Bulsara, Max', 'Zheng, Ming H']","['Mackie KE', 'Zhou Z', 'Robbins P', 'Bulsara M', 'Zheng MH']","['M508 Centre for Orthopaedic Research, School of Surgery, QEII Medical Centre, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Bone Joint Surg Am,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Initial pathogen binding and entry triggers a number of antiviral responses, including the activation of proapoptotic cell death pathways, which must be countered during latency establishment. However, mechanisms responsible for a prosurvival state in myeloid cells upon latent HCMV infection remain completely undefined. We hypothesized that the cellular antiapoptotic machinery must be initially activated by HCMV to promote early survival events upon entry. Here we show that HCMV transiently protects nonpermissive myeloid cells from chemical and virus entry induced cell death by up-regulating a key myeloid cell survival gene, myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1 protein. The induction of MCL-1 expression was independent of viral gene expression but dependent on activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway by viral glycoprotein B. Inhibition of ERK-MAPK signaling, inhibition of HCMV fusion, antibody-mediated neutralization of glycoprotein B signaling or expression of a shRNA against MCL-1 all correlated with increased cell death in response to virus infection or chemical stimulation. Finally we show that activation of ERK-MAPK signaling impacts on long-term latency and reactivation in hematopoietic cells. Thus, HCMV primes myeloid cells for from the initial virus-cell encounter. Given the importance of ERK and MCL-1 for myeloid cell survival, the successful establishment of HCMV latency in myeloid progenitors begins at the point of virus entry.","['Reeves, Matthew B', 'Breidenstein, Abagail', 'Compton, Teresa']","['Reeves MB', 'Breidenstein A', 'Compton T']","['Infectious Diseases-Virology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111227,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein B, Simplexvirus)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/*metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*transmission', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lentivirus', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",2011/12/29 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2011/12/29 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1114966108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1114966108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jan 10;109(2):588-93. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1114966108.

The role of sperm microRNAs (miRNAs) in preimplantation development is unknown. miRNA profiling identified six miRNAs expressed in the sperm and the zygotes but not in the oocytes or preimplantation embryos. Sperm contained both the precursor and the mature form of one of these miRNAs, miR-34c. The absence of an increased level of miR-34c in zygotes derived from alpha-amanitin-treated oocytes and in parthenogenetic oocytes supported a sperm origin of zygotic miR-34c. Injection of miR-34c inhibitor into zygotes inhibited DNA synthesis and significantly suppressed first cleavage division. A 3' UTR luciferase assay and Western blotting demonstrated that miR-34c regulates B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression in the zygotes. Coinjection of anti-Bcl-2 antibody in zygotes partially reversed but injection of Bcl-2 protein mimicked the effect of miR-34c inhibition. Oocyte activation is essential for the miR-34c action in zygotes, as demonstrated by a decrease in 3'UTR luciferase reporter activity and Bcl-2 expression after injection of precursor miR-34c into parthenogenetic oocytes.

Here, we developed methods to isolate, purify, and expand mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from mouse compact bone that may be used to regenerate bone in vivo. These cells were maintained in long-term culture and were capable of differentiating along multiple lineages, including chondrocyte, osteocyte, and adipocyte trajectories. We used standard cell isolation and culture methods to establish cell cultures from mouse compact bone and bone marrow. Cultures were grown in four distinct media to determine the optimal composition of culture medium for bone-derived MSCs. Putative MSCs were subjected to flow cytometry, alkaline phosphatase assays, immunohistochemical staining, and several differentiation assays to assess cell identity, protein expression, and developmental potential. Finally, we used an in vivo bone formation assay to determine whether putative MSCs were capable of regenerating bone. We found that compact bone of mice was a better source of MCSs than the bone marrow, that growth in plastic flasks served to purify MSCs from hematopoietic cells, and that MSCs grown in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-conditioned medium were, based on multiple criteria, superior to those grown in leukemia inhibitory factor-conditioned medium. Moreover, we found that the MSCs isolated from compact bone and grown in bFGF-conditioned medium were capable of supporting bone formation in vivo.

Angiogenesis has been shown to regulate progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The mechanism through which this happens has not been elucidated. We isolated and characterized exosomes from K562 CML cells and evaluated their effects on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Fluorescent-labeled exosomes were internalized by HUVECs during tubular differentiation on Matrigel. Exosome localization was perinuclear early in differentiation, moving peripherally in cells undergoing elongation and connection. Exosomes move within and between nanotubular structures connecting the remodeling endothelial cells. They stimulated angiotube formation over a serum/growth factor-limited medium control, doubling total cumulative tube length (P = 0.003). Treatment of K562 cells with two clinically active tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, reduced their total exosome release (P < 0.009); equivalent concentrations of drug-treated exosomes induced a similar extent of tubular differentiation. However, dasatinib treatment of HUVECs markedly inhibited HUVEC response to drug control CML exosomes (P < 0.002). In an in vivo mouse Matrigel plug model angiogenesis was induced by K562 exosomes and abrogated by oral dasatinib treatment (P < 0.01). K562 exosomes induced dasatinib-sensitive Src phosphorylation and activation of downstream Src pathway proteins in HUVECs. Imatinib was minimally active against exosome stimulation of HUVEC cell differentiation and signaling. Thus, CML cell-derived exosomes induce angiogenic activity in HUVEC cells. The inhibitory effect of dasatinib on exosome production and vascular differentiation and signaling reveals a key role for Src in both the leukemia and its microenvironment.","['Mineo, Marco', 'Garfield, Susan H', 'Taverna, Simona', 'Flugy, Anna', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo', 'Kohn, Elise C']","['Mineo M', 'Garfield SH', 'Taverna S', 'Flugy A', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R', 'Kohn EC']","['Molecular Signaling Section, Medical Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive MSC 1906, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111222,Germany,Angiogenesis,Angiogenesis,9814575,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Collagen/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Exosomes/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Laminin/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanotubes', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteoglycans/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2011/12/29 06:00,2012/05/31 06:00,['2011/12/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10456-011-9241-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Angiogenesis. 2012 Mar;15(1):33-45. doi: 10.1007/s10456-011-9241-1.

Thus these cells are also called leukemia stem cells (LSCs) because they are capable of instigating, maintaining and serially propagating leukemia in vivo, while retaining the ability to differentiate into committed progeny that lack these properties. Like hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), LSCs possess the ability of self-renewal under a complex regulatory system. The recent discovery of microRNAs may shed new light on regulation of LSCs and leukemogenesis. As master gene regulators, microRNAs participate in these processes through coordinated work with key transcription factors required for hematopoiesis. Therefore, microRNAs could play a critical role in normal HSCs as well as LSCs. The purpose of this review is to provide updates on the role of microRNAs in HSCs and LSCs and to highlight their potential in differentiation therapy of leukemias.","['Huang, Jianguo', 'Mo, Yin-Yuan']","['Huang J', 'Mo YY']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Immunology, and Cell Biology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL 62794, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Schol Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Scholar edition),101485241,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology']",2011/12/29 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2011/12/29 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['300 [pii]', '10.2741/s300 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Schol Ed). 2012 Jan 1;4:799-809. doi: 10.2741/s300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is still controversial whether the ""insensitivity"" of CML stem cells to treatment with TKI is due to BCR/ABL-dependent or independent mechanisms, treatment with IM appears to suppress BCR/ABL-dependent signaling in CML stem cells with no adverse effects on their survival. Recent evidence indicates that BCR/ABL suppresses and treatment of CML cells with IM/TKIs induces autophagy, a genetically-regulated process of adaptation to metabolic stress which could allow tumor cells to become metabolically inert enabling their survival under conditions that may mimic growth factor/nutrients deprivation. Based on this hypothesis, TKI-induced autophagy may ""antagonize"" TKI-induced cell death and inhibition of autophagy may eliminate this survival mechanism by restoring ""sensitivity"" of CML stem cells to treatment with IM/TKI. Consistent with this, phenotypically and functionally defined CML-enriched stem cells insensitive to treatment with TKI are efficiently eliminated by the combination of TKI and chloroquine, an inhibitor of late stage autophagy. Thus, inhibition of autophagy may improve the potent and specific effects of TKIs by rendering CML stem cells sensitive to these targeted therapies.","['Calabretta, Bruno', 'Salomoni, Paolo']","['Calabretta B', 'Salomoni P']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Biological knowledge is translated into abstract descriptions representing complex networks and the parameters of these mathematical models are derived from literature data or estimated from experimental measurements. The established mathematical models are used to interrogate key properties of the investigated system by model simulations. These predictions are validated based on previously published or novel experiments. Additionally, new drug targets are predicted or novel insights into biological processes are provided.

Activated alleles of FES are potent inducers of myeloid differentiation, however FES-deficient mice have only subtle differences in hematopoiesis. This may reflect overlapping function of other kinases such as FER. Studies of FES- and FER-deficient mice have revealed more prominent roles in regulating the activation of mature innate immune cells, including macrophages and mast cells. Recently, new insights into regulation of FES/FER kinases has emerged with the characterization of their N-terminal phospholipid-binding and membrane targeting FER/CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphyphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) and F-BAR extension (FX) domains. The F-BAR/FX domains regulate subcellular localization and FES/FER kinase activation. FES kinase activity is also enhanced upon ligand binding to its SH2 domain, which may lead to further phosphorylation of the same ligand, or other ligand-associated proteins. In mast cells, SH2 ligands of FES/FER include KIT receptor PTK, and the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) that trigger rapid activation of FES/FER and signaling to regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Recently, FES/FER have also been implicated in growth and survival signaling in leukemias driven by oncogenic KIT and FLT3 receptors. With further definition of their roles in immune cells and their progenitors, FES/FER may emerge as relevant therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases and leukemias.","['Craig, Andrew W B']",['Craig AW'],"[""Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University, Division of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Queen's Cancer Research Institute, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6 Canada. andrew.craig@queensu.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,"['110736-90-8 (proto-oncogene protein c-fes-fps)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testis/metabolism']",2011/12/29 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/12/29 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['3961 [pii]', '10.2741/3961 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2012 Jan 1;17:861-75. doi: 10.2741/3961.,['MOP82882/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Young (2-3 months) and aging (27-28 months) Fischer rats were used. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds elicited by tone bursts at 4, 8, 16, 32, and 40 kHz were measured. The expression patterns of Mcl-1 and Bax genes at both the mRNA and protein levels were examined using a real-time RT-PCR assay and Western blot. Distribution of Mcl-1 and Bax expression in the cochlear sensory epithelia was evaluated using immunohistology and nuclear staining. RESULTS: Aging cochleae exhibited a significant elevation of ABR thresholds. This change was accompanied by significant reduction in Mcl-1 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels and in the ratio of expression levels of Mcl-1/Bax genes in the aging subjects. Importantly, the changes in Mcl-1 and Bax expression are spatially related to the sensory cells showing the sign of degeneration.","['Yang, Wei Ping', 'Guo, Wei Wei', 'Liu, Hui Zhan', 'Xu, Yang', 'Chen, Lei', 'Hu, Bo Hua']","['Yang WP', 'Guo WW', 'Liu HZ', 'Xu Y', 'Chen L', 'Hu BH']","['Institute of Otolaryngology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, PR China. yangwp2002@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111227,England,Acta Otolaryngol,Acta oto-laryngologica,0370354,"['0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Aging/*metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cochlea/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hair Cells, Auditory/metabolism/pathology', 'Hearing Loss/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/29 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/12/29 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00016489.2011.631191 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Otolaryngol. 2012 Feb;132(2):123-32. doi: 10.3109/00016489.2011.631191.

The number of genes demonstrating increased expression levels was greater than the number of genes demonstrating decreased expression levels (445 genes vs. 183 genes, respectively). The significant enrichment analysis of GO terms for the differentially expressed genes revealed that these genes are involved in many important biological processes such as apoptosis. Six of the genes observed to be differentially expressed that might be involved in apoptosis were selected to undergo qRT-PCR validation.

METHODS: The data were generated by the ESCALE study, which included 764 AL cases and 1,681 controls in 2003-2004. The data on maternal smoking during pregnancy were obtained by standardized telephone interview of the cases' and controls' mothers. The genotypes CYP1A1*2A/2B (rs4646903), CYP2E1*5 (rs2031920, rs3813867), NQO1*2 (rs1800566), NAT2*5 (rs1801280), and EPHX1 exon 3 (rs1051740) and exon 4 (rs2234922) were obtained using a high-throughput platform and imputation for untyped polymorphisms. The analyses were restricted to the 493 cases (433 cases of lymphoblastic (ALL) and 51 of myeloblastic (AML) leukemia) and 441 controls with at least 2 grandparents born in Europe, who were genotyped with individual call rates greater than 95%. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression in case-control analyses and, for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, by case-only analyses. RESULTS: ALL and AML were not associated with either maternal smoking during pregnancy or candidate polymorphisms in CYP1A1, CYP2E1, EPHX1, and NQO1. Carrying two NAT2*5 alleles was significantly associated with ALL (OR = 1.8 [1.3-2.5]). The analyses also suggested an interaction between three genes involved in benzene metabolism CYP2E1, NQO1, and EPHX1. There was no interaction between maternal smoking and any of the polymorphisms under study. CONCLUSIONS: The ESCALE study did not evidence the interaction between CYP1A1*2A/2B and maternal smoking suggested previously. The association with NAT2*5 and the gene-gene interactions need to be replicated.","['Bonaventure, Audrey', 'Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Pasquet, Marlene', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Rialland, Xavier', 'Zelenika, Diana', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Bonaventure A', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Rudant J', 'Orsi L', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Pasquet M', 'Michel G', 'Sirvent N', 'Bordigoni P', 'Ducassou S', 'Rialland X', 'Zelenika D', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['Inserm, UMRS 1018, CESP, Team 6 Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer, Villejuif, France. audrey.bonaventure@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111227,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2F1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.2.9 (EPHX1 protein, human)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Benzene/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 2', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/genetics', 'Europe', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",2011/12/28 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2011/12/28 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-011-9882-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Feb;23(2):329-45. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9882-9.

The aim of this study was to present estimates of cancer incidence among Nordic male priests. The study cohort for our analyses consisted of 6.5 million men aged 30-64 years old who had participated in any computerised population census in four Nordic countries in 1990 or earlier. Follow-up was done by drawing linkages with the national population and cancer registries. 13,491 priests were identified by their job title codes. We estimated the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the priests using the male population as a reference. Priests had a lower cancer incidence than the general population (overall SIR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82-0.88). The majority of smoking- and alcohol-related cancers were associated with decreased SIR estimates. Increased risks were observed for skin melanoma (SIR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11-1.62), acute myeloid leukemia (SIR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.20-2.47) and thyroid cancer (SIR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.22-2.73). This is the first cohort study regarding the incidence of cancer among priests. The lower incidence of smoking and alcohol-related cancers among Nordic male priests can be explained by their lower exposure to cigarettes and alcohol when compared to the general population. A greater risk of melanoma is typical of highly-educated people, but it is unclear why priests should have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia or thyroid cancer.","['Stang, Andreas', 'Martinsen, Jan Ivar', 'Kjaerheim, Kristina', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Sparen, Par', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Pukkala, Eero']","['Stang A', 'Martinsen JI', 'Kjaerheim K', 'Weiderpass E', 'Sparen P', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Pukkala E']","['Medizinische Fakultat, Institut fur Klinische Epidemiologie, Martin-Luther-Universitat Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany. andreas.stang@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111227,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Religion', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2011/12/28 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-011-9645-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2012 Feb;27(2):101-8. doi: 10.1007/s10654-011-9645-7.

Numerous studies have shown that protein phosphatase is involved in the regulation of T cell signaling and activation. In this study, we investigated the effect of overexpression of PP4 on the expression of members of the MAP kinase family in Jurkat leukemia T cells, which had previously been stimulated with UV, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), ionomycin and okadaic acid. We found that the overexpression of PP4 expressed relatively low activity in the absence of any kind of stimulation. However, TPA, UV or ionomycin treatment strongly increased the activity of PP4. In addition, Jurkat T cells, transfected with various expression plasmids and/or stimulated with TPA, UV or ionomycin strongly induced the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, whereas the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 kinase pathway was weekly activated. Treatment of Jurkat T cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2, also inhibited the increase of JNK and p38 activity induced by PP4. The effect of okadaic acid on the activity of PP4 was similar to that observed in Jurkat T cells treated with a dominant negative c-Jun (dn-jun). These results indicate that the activation of JNK and p38, but not ERKs, is a target for the PP4 activity in Jurkat leukemia T cells.","['Parra, Eduardo']",['Parra E'],"['Biomedical Experimental Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, University of Tarapaca, Arica, Chile. eparra@uta.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Calcium Ionophores)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (protein phosphatase 4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcium Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2011/12/28 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/12/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2011.720 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2012 Mar;5(3):773-8. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2011.720.

Comparisons of the percent of human leukemia cells in blood and survival curves showed resveratrol did not inhibit progression of the disease. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of mouse sera showed resveratrol was rapidly metabolized to glucuronidated and sulfated forms 1 h post-injection, with low to no resveratrol or metabolites observed in sera by 24-48 h.

Because these conditions also occur in women of childbearing age who may become pregnant, information regarding the safety of this medication in pregnancy is essential. This systematic review attempts to summarize all published data on outcome of pregnancies exposed to IFN alpha, trying to differentiate between disease effect and drug effect. METHODS: Reports on the use of IFN alpha in human pregnancy and reports on essential thrombocythemia (ET) without use of any medication in pregnancy were identified by a systematic search of the medical literature. We were able to locate only case reports of IFN alpha exposure in pregnancy, of whom 40 out of 63 were diagnosed with ET. We also collected randomly 71 cases (more cases were available in the literature) that were diagnosed with ET due to different etiologies, but who had not received any medication in pregnancy. RESULTS: Among the 63 IFN alpha exposures in pregnancy, the mean maternal age was 30+/-6 years and the mean full term babies' weight was 3096+/-463 g. Mean gestational age at delivery was 37+/-3 weeks. There were 55 single and 4 twin pregnancies. No cases of major malformations or stillbirths were reported. There was one case of spontaneous abortion and 13 preterm deliveries (20% of all exposed cases). Among the 71 cases with untreated ET in pregnancy of different etiologies, 46 (65%) had early (within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) or late (13-20 weeks of gestation) pregnancy loss. There were also 3 cases (4%) of stillbirth and 4 cases (5.6%) of preterm delivery. Only 18 women (25%) delivered healthy term babies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our systematic review suggest that IFN-alpha does not significantly increase the risk of major malformation, miscarriage, stillbirth or preterm delivery above general population rates. It is also possible that IFN-alpha may have a protective effect against pregnancy loss in cases of ET.","['Yazdani Brojeni, P', 'Matok, I', 'Garcia Bournissen, F', 'Koren, G']","['Yazdani Brojeni P', 'Matok I', 'Garcia Bournissen F', 'Koren G']","['The Motherisk Program, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20111219,United States,Reprod Toxicol,"Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",8803591,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology']",2011/12/28 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2011/12/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0890-6238(11)00413-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Toxicol. 2012 Jun;33(3):265-8. doi: 10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.11.003.

However, only approximately 50% of primary MDS patients show clonal cytogenetic aberrations. To determine whether high-resolution microarray analysis would reveal new or additional aberrations, we analyzed 35 samples derived from patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of MDS and abnormal karyotypes. We used a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray with targeted coverage of approximately 1900 genes associated with hematologic and other cancers. Clinically relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs) were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in all samples (range 1-31, median 5). In 28 of 35 samples (80%), aCGH revealed new cytogenetic aberrations not seen by karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Furthermore, 132 cryptic aberrations (</=5 Mb) were identified in 25 cases (71.4%) including deletions of NF1, RUNX1, RASSF1, CCND1, TET2, DNMT3A, HRAS, PDGFRA and FIP1L1. Additionally, aCGH clarified known complex aberrations in 17 of 35 samples (48.6%). Finally, our results using whole-genome arrays with higher density coverage targeted to cancer features demonstrate the usefulness of arrays to identify rare and cryptic recurring imbalances that may prove to be significant in disease progression or transformation to AML and may improve the suitability or efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy.","['Kolquist, Kathryn A', 'Schultz, Roger A', 'Furrow, Aubry', 'Brown, Theresa C', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Campbell, Lynda J', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Shaffer, Lisa G', 'Ballif, Blake C']","['Kolquist KA', 'Schultz RA', 'Furrow A', 'Brown TC', 'Han JY', 'Campbell LJ', 'Wall M', 'Slovak ML', 'Shaffer LG', 'Ballif BC']","['Sacred Heart Medical Center, Spokane, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2011/12/28 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/12/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00297-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 Nov;204(11):603-28. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.004.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the incidences of leukoencephalopathy and disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (DNL) following intrathecal MTX therapy for CNS lymphoma or leukemia and to assess the potential risk factors. METHODS: Between January 2000 and August 2009, 143 patients with CNS lymphoma or leukemia received intrathecal MTX therapy alone or in combination with WBRT at a single institution. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically at regular two- or three-month intervals. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information regarding the patients' demographics, medical histories, radiologic characteristics, treatments, and clinical courses. RESULTS: On follow-up MR images, leukoencephalopathy was found in 95 of 143 patients (66.4%). The median time to develop leukoencephalopathy was 6.6 months. Among those with leukoencephalopathy, four patients showed seven extensive white-matter changes with strongly enhancing lesions demonstrating DNL. Histological confirmation was done in six lesions of three patients and radiological diagnosis alone in one patient. Four lesions spontaneously disappeared on MR images without any treatment, with a mean duration of 14 months before disappearance of DNL. CONCLUSION: Leukoencephalopathy is a common phenomenon that occurs following intrathecal MTX therapy; however, DNL occurs at a very low incidence. For newly developed enhancing lesions, consideration for the occurrence of DNL should be taken to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures or therapies.","['Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Kim, Sung Tae', 'Nam, Do-Hyun', 'Lee, Jung-Il', 'Park, Kwan', 'Kong, Doo-Sik']","['Kim JY', 'Kim ST', 'Nam DH', 'Lee JI', 'Park K', 'Kong DS']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Center for Imaging Science, Samsung Medical Center, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111031,Korea (South),J Korean Neurosurg Soc,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,101467054,,,,2011/12/27 06:00,2011/12/27 06:01,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2010/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3340/jkns.2011.50.4.304 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Neurosurg Soc. 2011 Oct;50(4):304-10. doi: 10.3340/jkns.2011.50.4.304.

Detection of BRAF gene mutation and analyses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are of great scientific interest. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 581 NSCLC patients (377 males, 204 female) undergoing pulmonary resection. BRAF gene mutations were screened using the PCR-SSCP method and were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene were also analyzed. RESULTS: Five patients (0.8%) had BRAF mutations within exon 15. In 581 NSCLC patients, EGFR gene mutations within exons 18 to 21 were detected in 191 (32.8%) patients, KRAS codon 12 mutations in 56 (9.6%) patients, and ERBB2 codon 20 mutations in 11 (1.8%) patients. All mutations were mutually exclusive. The NSCLC patients with BRAF mutations were proved to be men who were heavy smokers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 notdiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic cell morphology was examined by cell staining with Hoechst 33342. Cellular caspase-3/7 activities were measured after arsenic treatment. RESULTS: The inhibitory concentration by 50% (IC(50)) values of As(2)O(3) towards MOLT-4 and daunorubicin- resistant MOLT-4/DNR cell proliferation were 0.87 and 0.92 muM, while the values for arsenic acid were 69.1 and 116.6 muM, respectively. These arsenic compounds also inhibited mitogen-induced proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Six organic arsenic compounds did not inhibit leukemia cell proliferation. As(2)O(3) and arsenic acid induced apoptotic cell morphology and increased caspase-3/7 activity in the leukemia cells. Ascorbic acid and buthionine sulfoxide enhanced, while N-acetyl-L-cysteine abated, the suppressive effects of inorganic arsenic compounds on leukemia cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: As(2)O(3) and arsenic acid inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in MOLT-4 and daunorubicine-resistant MOLT-4/DNR cells via glutathione-depletion and subsequent caspase-3/7 activation.

Following our original report, providing the first description of potential tumor suppressor function associated with the histone methyltransferase SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) in breast cancer, the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of 16 further histone-modifier genes in a well annotated cohort of patients with primary operable breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer tissues (n=127) and normal tissues (n=33) underwent RNA extraction and reverse transcription, and histone-modifier gene transcript levels were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. The histone-modifier genes included: histone acetyltransferases (cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CREBBP)); class I (histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)), II (histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5)) and III (sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)) histone deacetylases; and histone methyltransferases (SET domain containing suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2)) amongst others. Expression levels were analysed against tumor size, grade, nodal involvement, histological subtype, receptor status, TNM stage, Nottingham Prognostic Index, and disease-free and overall survival over a 10-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Expression of histone-modifier genes in breast cancer differed significantly from those in normal tissue (HDAC5, HDAC1, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A)). Differences in expression profiles were also found to exist between individual breast tumors and, in some cases, were significantly associated with conventional pathological parameters and prognostic indices: tumor grade (K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5), HDAC1, KDM4A, SUV39H1 and KDM6A)); TNM stage (SUV39H1, K (lysine) acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A), KDM4A, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C), K (lysine) acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), HDAC5 and KAT5)); Nottingham Prognostic Index (KDM5C, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), KAT8 and SET and MYND domain containing 3 (SMYD3)); receptor status (KAT5, SMYD3 and KDM1A); histological type (KAT5, KDM5C, KAT8, KDM4A and MLL); disease-free survival (SUV39H1, SMYD3, HDAC5, KDM6A, HDAC1, KDM1A, KDM4A, KAT8, KDM5C, KAT5 and MLL) and overall survival (KAT8). Significant correlations were identified between the differential expression profiles of particular histone-modifying genes. CONCLUSION: Expression levels of histone-modifier genes in breast cancer differ significantly from normal tissue. Differences in expression profiles exist between breast tumors and are significantly associated with conventional pathological parameters and clinical outcomes. Further study is warranted to determine the consequences of altered expression for each specific histone-modifier gene and the biological and clinical implications of combinatorial variations in expression profiles.

The purpose of this study was to control all processes of pregnancy in mice, from embryo implantation to parturition, without ovaries. The ovaries were removed before embryo implantation, and a single injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was given. Embryo implantation was induced by leukemia inhibitory factor, which can substitute 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). Continuous exposure to E(2) was necessary at mid-pregnancy, when placentation was completed. All mice sustained pregnancy without ovaries before parturition, which was initiated by the removal of E(2) and MPA. Murine pregnancy is a complicated process involving embryo implantation, placentation, and parturition. Complete control of pregnancy was achieved with the simple treatment of MPA and E(2) after induction of embryo implantation. Here, time-dependent events in the uterus during pregnancy could be realized without the ovaries, because the initiation of each event could be stringently controlled by hormonal treatments.","['Terakawa, Jumpei', 'Watanabe, Takaho', 'Obara, Rutsuko', 'Sugiyama, Makoto', 'Inoue, Naoko', 'Ohmori, Yasushige', 'Hosaka, Yoshinao Z', 'Hondo, Eiichi']","['Terakawa J', 'Watanabe T', 'Obara R', 'Sugiyama M', 'Inoue N', 'Ohmori Y', 'Hosaka YZ', 'Hondo E']","['Laboratory of Animal Morphology, Division of Biofunctional Development, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111223,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Hormones)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Litter Size/drug effects', '*Mice/physiology', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Ovariectomy', 'Parturition/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', '*Pregnancy, Animal']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-11-0288 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-11-0288 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2012 Mar;143(3):411-5. doi: 10.1530/REP-11-0288.

The compound 1,3-beta-D-glucan (BG), a cell wall component of most fungal species, can be detected in blood during IFI. Four commercial BG antigenemia assays are available (Fungitell, Fungitec-G, Wako, and Maruha). This meta-analysis from the Third European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-3) assessed the performance of BG assays for the diagnosis of IFI in hemato-oncological patients. METHODS: Studies reporting the performance of BG antigenemia assays for the diagnosis of IFI (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group criteria) in hemato-oncological patients were identified. The analysis was focused on high-quality cohort studies with exclusion of case-control studies. Meta-analysis was performed by conventional meta-analytical pooling and bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Six cohort studies were included (1771 adult patients with 414 IFIs of which 215 were proven or probable). Similar performance was observed among the different BG assays. For the cutoff recommended by the manufacturer, the diagnostic performance of the BG assay in proven or probable IFI was better with 2 consecutive positive test results (diagnostic odds ratio for 2 consecutive vs one single positive results, 111.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 38.6-324.1] vs 16.3 [95% CI, 6.5-40.8], respectively; heterogeneity index for 2 consecutive vs one single positive results, 0% vs 72.6%, respectively). For 2 consecutive tests, sensitivity and specificity were 49.6% (95% CI, 34.0%-65.3%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 97.4%-99.5%), respectively. Estimated positive and negative predictive values for an IFI prevalence of 10% were 83.5% and 94.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different BG assays have similar accuracy for the diagnosis of IFI in hemato-oncological patients. Two consecutive positive antigenemia assays have very high specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Because sensitivity is low, the test needs to be combined with clinical, radiological, and microbiological findings.","['Lamoth, Frederic', 'Cruciani, Mario', 'Mengoli, Carlo', 'Castagnola, Elio', 'Lortholary, Olivier', 'Richardson, Malcolm', 'Marchetti, Oscar']","['Lamoth F', 'Cruciani M', 'Mengoli C', 'Castagnola E', 'Lortholary O', 'Richardson M', 'Marchetti O']","['Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20111223,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (beta-Glucans)'],IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'beta-Glucans/*blood']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cir897 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/cir897 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Mar 1;54(5):633-43. doi: 10.1093/cid/cir897.

However, adverse events were observed during some of these HSC gene therapy clinical trials, linked to insertional activation of proto-oncogenes by integrated proviral vectors leading to clonal expansion and eventual development of leukemia. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis of vector-mediated genotoxicity, with the aim of developing safer vectors and lower-risk gene therapy protocols. This review will summarize current information on the mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to integrating gene transfer vectors, discuss the available assays for predicting genotoxicity and mapping vector integration sites, and introduce newly-developed approaches for minimizing genotoxicity as a way to further move HSC gene therapy forward into broader clinical application.","['Wu, Chuanfeng', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Wu C', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111227,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,IM,"['Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/virology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/virology', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-011-0159-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2011 Dec;5(4):356-71. doi: 10.1007/s11684-011-0159-1.

ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy is the current standard treatment, and for high-risk patients, high doses cytarabine have a beneficial effect on relapse prevention. In recent years, the indications of arsenic trioxide (ATO) therapy for APL have been extended from the salvage therapy for relapse patients to the first-line treatment of de novo APL. The introduction of both ATRA and ATO represents great achievements in translational medicine.

PR1-specific T cells have been linked to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. We hypothesized that lymphopenia induced by chemo-radiotherapy can enhance weak autoimmune responses to self-antigens such as PR1. We measured PR1-specific responses in 27 patients 30-120 days following allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and correlated these with ELA2 and PR3 expression and minimal residual disease (MRD). Post-SCT 10/13 CML, 6/9 ALL, and 4/5 solid tumor patients had PR1 responses correlating with PR3 and ELA2 expression. At day 180 post-SCT, 8/8 CML patients with PR1 responses were BCR-ABL-negative compared with 2/5 BCR-ABL-positive patients (P = 0.025). In contrast, PR1 responses were detected in 2/4 MRD-negative compared with 4/5 MRD-positive ALL patients (P = 0.76). To assess whether the lymphopenic milieu also exaggerates weak T-cell responses in the autologous setting, we measured spontaneous induction of PR1 responses in 3 AML patients vaccinated with WT1-126 peptide following lymphodepletion. In addition to WT1-specific T cells, we detected PR1-specific T cells in 2 patients during hematopoietic recovery. Our findings suggest that lymphopenia induced by chemo-radiotherapy enhances weak autoimmune responses to self-antigens, which may result in GVL if the leukemia expresses the relevant self-antigen.","['Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Yong, Agnes S M', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Jafarpour, Behnam', 'Eniafe, Rhoda', 'Le, Robert Quan', 'Musse, Laura', 'Boss, Carole', 'Childs, Richard', 'John Barrett, A']","['Rezvani K', 'Yong AS', 'Mielke S', 'Savani BN', 'Jafarpour B', 'Eniafe R', 'Le RQ', 'Musse L', 'Boss C', 'Childs R', 'John Barrett A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. k.rezvani@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111224,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RMFPNAPYL)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology/therapeutic use', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/27 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1187-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Jul;61(7):1125-36. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1187-z.

In this study, we investigated whether established leukemia cell line contains LSCs. We showed that KG1a leukemia cell line contained leukemic stem-like cells, which have been phenotypically restricted within the CD34(+)CD38(-) fractions. CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could generate CD34(+)CD38(+) cells in culture medium and had renewal function. Moreover, CD34(+)CD38(-) cells had self-renewal potential. We found that leukemic stem-like cells from KG1a cells were resistant to chemotherapy and NK-mediated cytotoxicity. NKG2D ligands involve in protecting LSCs from NK-mediated attack. Taken together, our studies provide a novel cell model for leukemic stem cells research.

Today, many hematological centers, including 14 university hospitals, have been developed in the entire north and have useful epidemiological data pertinent to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We studied the incidence of AML and its subtypes, age distribution, geographic distribution and trends in the rate of diagnosis over the last 5 years in Algeria. Secondary goals were to study trends of referral of AML cases from various regions to specific centers to assess the needs for health infrastructure and change of current practices. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of nationwide survey of all adult cases of AML (>16 years) diagnosed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey form was distributed to all departments of hematology at the 15 participating centers. RESULTS: The 1426 cases of AML diagnosed during the study period represented an annual incidence of 0.91/100000 persons with a male to female (M/F) ratio of 1:16 and a median age of 45 years (range, 16-82 years). Nationally, 20% of cases AML were diagnosed in the whole western region of the country, 47% in the central and 33% in the east. There was a trend of continuous increase in the rate with age and in the rate of diagnosis over the last 5 years. The most common subtype was M2, followed by M4 and M5. CONCLUSION: An overall increase in the number of AML patients diagnosed nationwide over the last five years indicates a need for additional health care resources including curative and therapy-intense strategies, such as stem cell transplant facilities to optimize outcome. The relatively younger age of patients compared to the Western countries may be due to the demographic composition of our population.","['Bekadja, M A', 'Hamladji, R M', 'Belhani, M', 'Ardjoun, F Z', 'Abad, M T', 'Touhami, H', 'Ait-Ali, H', 'Zouaoui, Z', 'Sidimansour, N', 'Hamdi, S', 'Grifi, F', 'Mesli, N', 'Saidi, M', 'Mehalhal, N', 'Bachiri, A', 'Bouhass, R', 'Said, Y M', 'Midoun, N']","['Bekadja MA', 'Hamladji RM', 'Belhani M', 'Ardjoun FZ', 'Abad MT', 'Touhami H', 'Ait-Ali H', 'Zouaoui Z', 'Sidimansour N', 'Hamdi S', 'Grifi F', 'Mesli N', 'Saidi M', 'Mehalhal N', 'Bachiri A', 'Bouhass R', 'Said YM', 'Midoun N']","['Clinic of Hematology and Cell Therapy, University Hospital, Etablissement Hospitalier et Universitaire, Oran, Algeria. mabekadja@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algeria/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.5144/1658-3876.2011.161 [pii]', '10.5144/1658-3876.2011.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2011;4(4):161-6. doi: 10.5144/1658-3876.2011.161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little data on the effectiveness or toxicity of this drug outside the trial setting. This is the first report on the use of bendamustine from the Indian subcontinent. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis of response and side effects of bendamustine in eight patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and eight patients with follicular lymphoma. METHODS: Data was collated from a review of case records. We examined any association between side effects and clinical parameters. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 52 years and three-quarters had received prior treatment with alkylators or fludarabine. Three different protocols of bendamustine were used (single agent, in combination with rituximab or in combination with vincristine and prednisolone). The overall response rate was 80% (47% complete response, 33% partial response, and 20% progressive disease). The drug was well tolerated with very few grade 3/4 toxicities.

The objective of the study was to analyze the correlation between transplant-related outcomes and administered CD34+, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cell doses in patients who had undergone peripheral blood, AHCT and received either in vivo T-cell depleted or T-cell replete allografts. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of consecutive patients who underwent peripheral blood AHCT in our institution between January 2003 and December 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort of 149 patients was divided into two groups; non T-cell depleted (NTCD) (n=54) and T-cell depleted (TCD) (n=95). Study endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), engraftment kinetics (neutrophil and platelet recovery), incidence of acute graft versus host disease (acute GVHD), chronic GVHD, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and disease relapse. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that higher infused CD34+ cell dose improved OS (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.98, P=.04), PFS (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, P=.05) and NRM (relative risk 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.99, P=.048) in the TCD group. By multivariate analysis, there was no difference in engraftment, grades II-IV acute GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD and relapse in the two groups relative to the infused cell doses. There was a trend towards improved OS (relative risk 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-1.01, P=.05) with higher CD3+ cell dose in the TCD group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that higher CD34+ cell dose imparts survival benefit only to in vivo TCD peripheral blood AHCT recipients.","['Kanate, Abraham Sebastian', 'Craig, Michael', 'Cumpston, Aaron', 'Saad, Ayman', 'Hobbs, Gerry', 'Leadmon, Sonia', 'Bunner, Pamela', 'Watkins, Kathy', 'Bulian, Deirdre', 'Gibson, Laura', 'Abraham, Jame', 'Remick, Scott C', 'Hamadani, Mehdi']","['Kanate AS', 'Craig M', 'Cumpston A', 'Saad A', 'Hobbs G', 'Leadmon S', 'Bunner P', 'Watkins K', 'Bulian D', 'Gibson L', 'Abraham J', 'Remick SC', 'Hamadani M']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, West Virginia University, USA. abesebastian@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.5144/1658-3876.2011.149 [pii]', '10.5144/1658-3876.2011.149 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2011;4(4):149-56. doi: 10.5144/1658-3876.2011.149.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease progression is associated with increasing genomic instability and a large proportion of patients go on to develop acute myeloid leukemia. Primarily a disease of the elderly, it can also develop after chemotherapy. We have previously reported that CREB binding protein (Crebbp) heterozygous mice have an increased incidence of hematological malignancies, and others have shown that CREBBP is one of the genes altered by chromosomal translocations found in patients suffering from therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. This led us to investigate whether hematopoietic tumor development in Crebbp(+/-) mice is preceded by a myelodysplastic phase and whether we could uncover molecular mechanisms that might contribute to its development. We report here that Crebbp(+/-) mice invariably develop myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm within 9 to 12 months of age. They are also hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and show a marked decrease in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activity after irradiation. In addition, protein levels of XRCC1 and APEX1, key components of base excision repair machinery, are reduced in unirradiated Crebbp(+/-) cells or upon targeted knockdown of CREBBP levels. Our results provide validation of a novel myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm mouse model and, more importantly, point to defective repair of DNA damage as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of this currently incurable disease.","['Zimmer, Stephanie N', 'Lemieux, Madeleine E', 'Karia, Bijal P', 'Day, Claudia', 'Zhou, Ting', 'Zhou, Qing', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Suresh, Uthra', 'Chen, Yidong', 'Kinney, Marsha C', 'Bishop, Alexander J R', 'Rebel, Vivienne I']","['Zimmer SN', 'Lemieux ME', 'Karia BP', 'Day C', 'Zhou T', 'Zhou Q', 'Kung AL', 'Suresh U', 'Chen Y', 'Kinney MC', 'Bishop AJ', 'Rebel VI']","['Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomic Instability', 'Heterozygote', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Preleukemia/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/toxicity', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00596-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Apr;40(4):295-306.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.12.004.

Micellar nanoparticles were covalently decorated with CLL1-targeting peptides for targeted drug delivery. The resulting peptide-coated nanoparticles were 13.5 nm in diameter and could be loaded with 5 mg of daunorubicin per 20 mg of telodendrimers. These ""targeting nanomicelles"" transported the drug load to the interior of cells expressing CLL1 and to LSCs isolated from clinical specimens in vitro, but did not bind to normal blood or normal hematopoietic stem cells. The presence of CLL1-targeting peptides on the surface of the nanomicelles enabled the improved binding and delivery of substantially more daunorubicin into the cells expressing CLL1 and CD34(+) leukemic cells compared with unmodified nanomicelles. In conclusion, nanomicelles coated with CLL1-targeting peptides are potentially useful for eradicating LSCs and improving leukemia therapy.

Consolidation treatments include chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine, or allogeneic or autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In a post-hoc analysis of the AML96 trial (NCT00180115), our aim was to differentiate groups of patients according to the treatments that would provide them optimum benefit. METHODS: In the multicentre AML96 trial, 586 patients (aged 15-60 years) with AML--excluding those with t(8;21)--who were in complete remission after double induction treatment were consolidated with allogeneic HSCT, autologous HSCT, or chemotherapy containing high-dose cytarabine in a priority-based and risk-adapted manner. We assessed the association between potentially prognostic variables and overall survival after complete remission by use of a stratified Cox regression analysis. With the significant variables of the resulting model, we developed a PRT score in 452 patients with a complete dataset. This score was then validated by use of data from 407 patients from the AML2003 trial (NCT00180102). FINDINGS: Age, percentage of CD34-positive blasts, FLT3-ITD mutant-to-wild-type ratio, cytogenetic risk, and de-novo or secondary AML were identified as independent prognostic factors, and included in the PRT score. The PRT score separated patients in AML96 into three groups: favourable (n=190; 3-year survival 68%, 95% CI 60-74), intermediate (n=198; 49%, 42-56), and unfavourable (n=64; 20%, 12-31). All pair-wise comparisons of two of three PRT score groups were significant in the log-rank test (p<0.0001). Similar results were noted when data from AML2003 were used: 3-year survival for the favourable group (n=265) was 69% (62-76), for the intermediate group (n=114) it was 61% (50-71), and for the unfavourable group (n=28) it was 46% (24-65). The overall comparison between the three risk groups resulted in significantly different survival probabilities (p=0.015). We also analysed response to treatment in AML96 in each of the PRT score groups. In the favourable group, patients given allogeneic HSCT (n=60) had higher survival probabilities (82%, 69-89) than did those given chemotherapy (n=56, 55%, 41-67; p=0.0012) or autologous HSCT (n=74, 66%, 54-76; p=0.044). In the intermediate PRT score group, patients given autologous HSCT (n=69) had the best survival probabilities (62%, 50-72) compared with those given chemotherapy (n=72, 41%, 30-52; p=0.0006) or allogeneic HSCT (n=57, 44%, 31-56; p=0.0045). INTERPRETATION: The PRT score groups could help physicians to tailor treatment for patients with AML and our results lend support to the use of autologous HSCT in patients aged 60 years or younger with an intermediate PRT score.

METHODS: Treatment consisted of vatalanib 1250 mg given orally once daily. CT scans were obtained at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter. Baseline serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and mesothelin were obtained. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients enrolled at 19 centers. The median age was 75 years, and the majority of patients (79%) had an ECOG performance status of 1. Tumors were classified as epithelial (77%), sarcomatoid (10%), or mixed (9%) histology. Toxicity was mild; the most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (2%), nausea (15%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (11%), hypertension (2%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (2%). Partial responses were observed in 6% of patients and stable disease in 72% of patients. The 3-month PFS rate was 55% (95% CI: 40%, 68%). The median PFS was 4.1 months. Median overall survival was 10.0 months. There was no correlation between serum levels of VEGF, PDGF, TSP-1, or mesothelin and treatment response, PFS, or survival. CONCLUSIONS: Vatalanib as a single agent with this dose and schedule does not warrant further study in this disease.","['Jahan, Thierry', 'Gu, Lin', 'Kratzke, Robert', 'Dudek, Arkadiusz', 'Otterson, Gregory A', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Green, Mark', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Kindler, Hedy Lee']","['Jahan T', 'Gu L', 'Kratzke R', 'Dudek A', 'Otterson GA', 'Wang X', 'Green M', 'Vokes EE', 'Kindler HL']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. tjahan@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111222,Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5DX9U76296 (vatalanib)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelin', 'Mesothelioma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Phthalazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombospondin 1/blood', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0169-5002(11)00588-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2012 Jun;76(3):393-6. doi: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.11.014.

Thus, here we have investigated BAALC expression and post-translational histone modifications in leukemia cell lines. We show that Kasumi-6 and Kyo cells have high and low BAALC mRNA levels, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that these cell lines present distinct profiles in terms of histone post-translational modifications (H3K9K14 acetylation, H3K4 trimethylation and H3K23 trimethylation) at the level of BAALC promoter. These findings, in light of recent data on how histone post-translational modifications control gene expression, indicate that BAALC gene is ""paused"" and that in leukemia cells its transcription can be activated or repressed by mechanisms acting on epigenetic marks.","['Franzoni, Alessandra', 'Passon, Nadia', 'Fabbro, Dora', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Damante, Giuseppe']","['Franzoni A', 'Passon N', 'Fabbro D', 'Tiribelli M', 'Damiani D', 'Damante G']","['Istituto di Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria S.

However, its impact on long-term outcome in oncological patients including adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has not been determined so far. METHODS: In the current study follow-up data from individual patients recruited in five multicentre, prospective, randomised trials were pooled to perform a joint analysis. Among 347 adults and adolescents with ALL, 185 were assigned to receive prophylactically G-CSF along with induction chemotherapy while 162 patients were treated without G-CSF support. RESULTS: With the median follow-up of 5.3years, there was a tendency towards increased 5year probability of the overall survival for the G-CSF arm compared to the controls (32%+/-4% versus 23%+/-4%, p=.07), which reached statistical significance in a subgroup of T-ALL (51%+/-8% versus 29%+/-9%, p=.01) and among patients aged 21-40years (44%+/-6% versus 27%+/-6%, p=.03). The probability of leukaemia-free survival was 38%+/-4% and 24%+/-4% (p=.01) while the median remission duration equalled 33 and 17months (p=.007), respectively. In a multivariate analysis the prophylactic use of G-CSF was independently associated with reduced risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR)=.64, p=.007) and treatment failure (HR=.67, p=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of G-CSF during induction of ALL is associated with improved long-term outcome and should be recommended especially in a setting of T-ALL and in 'young adults'. Our analysis provides the first direct evidence coming from prospective trials for the impact of primary G-CSF prophylaxis on disease-free survival of oncological patients.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Hallbook, Helene', 'Geissler, Klaus', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Smedmyr, Bengt', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy']","['Giebel S', 'Thomas X', 'Hallbook H', 'Geissler K', 'Boiron JM', 'Huguet F', 'Koller E', 'Jaeger U', 'Smedmyr B', 'Hellmann A', 'Holowiecki J']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111222,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00963-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Feb;48(3):360-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.023.

Thus, the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML is an important strategy to better identify high risk patients. Most sensitive methodology to detect MRD is molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but its applicability is restricted to AML with leukemia-specific molecular targets (e.g. AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11, MLL, FLT-3). In our study, MRD was monitored at different time points with both MFC and WT1-RNA quantification in 23 AML patients who did not present specific molecular targets. As previously published, we considered values of 10(-3) (0.1%) in MFC and 90 WT1-RNA x 10(4) ABL copies as optimal thresholds. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to confirm these data.

Problems occur when host responses to an infection are either too weak to effectively help eradicate the pathogen, or when they become too strong and are associated with host damage rather than protection. Immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) can be generally defined as a restoration of host immunity in a previously immunosuppressed patient that becomes dysregulated and overly robust, resulting in host damage and sometimes death. IRS associated with opportunistic mycoses presents as new or worsening clinical symptoms or radiographic signs consistent with an inflammatory process that occur during receipt of an appropriate antifungal, and that cannot be explained by a newly acquired infection. Because there are currently no established tests or biomarkers for IRS, it can be difficult to distinguish from progression of the original infection, although culture and biomarkers for the fungal pathogen or infection are typically negative during diagnostic workup. IRS was originally characterized in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, but has subsequently been described in solid-organ transplant recipients, neutropenic patients, women in the postpartum period, and recipients of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor therapy. In each of these cases, recovery of the host's immunity during treatment of an initial infection results in a powerful proinflammatory environment that overshoots and leads to host damage. Optimal management of IRS has not been established at present, but often involves treatment with a corticosteroid or other anti-inflammatory compounds. This article uses a number of patient cases to explore the intricacies of diagnosing and managing a patient with IRS, as well as the other extreme, namely patients who are so immunocompromised without immune recovery that they essentially become breeding grounds for a wide range of opportunistic pathogens, often simultaneously.","['Perfect, John R']",['Perfect JR'],"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. perfe001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryptococcosis/immunology', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fusariosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome/*diagnosis/immunology', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/01/04 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9343(11)00905-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 2012 Jan;125(1 Suppl):S39-51. doi: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.10.010.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the negative consequences of IFI, for some high-risk patients the potential benefits of prophylactic therapy may outweigh the risks. When using a prophylactic, empiric, or preemptive therapeutic approach, clinicians must take into account the local epidemiology, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and safety profile of different antifungal agents, together with unique host-related factors that may affect antifungal efficacy or safety. Therapeutic drug monitoring is increasingly recognized as important or necessary when employing lipophilic triazoles (itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) or flucytosine. Because early diagnostics remain limited for uncommon, yet emerging opportunistic molds (e.g., Mucorales), and treatment delay is associated with increased mortality, early effective management often depends on a high index of suspicion, taking into account predisposing factors, host cues favoring mucormycosis, and local epidemiology. Antifungal options for mucormycosis are limited, and optimal management depends on a multimodal approach that includes early diagnosis/clinical suspicion, correction of underlying predisposing factors, radical debridement of affected tissues, and extended antifungal therapy.

Standard histopathologic diagnostic techniques are often untenable in at-risk patients, and culture-based diagnostics typically are too insensitive or nonspecific, or provide results after too long a delay for optimal IFI management. Newer surrogate markers of IFIs with improved sensitivity and specificity are needed to enable earlier diagnosis and, ideally, to provide prognostic information and/or permit therapeutic monitoring. Surrogate assays should also be accessible and easy to implement in the hospital. Several nonculture-based assays of newer surrogates are making their way into the medical setting or are currently under investigation. These new or up-and-coming surrogates include antigens/antibodies (mannan and antimannan antibodies) or fungal metabolites (d-arabinitol) for detection of invasive candidiasis, the Aspergillus cell wall component galactomannan used to detect invasive aspergillosis, or the fungal cell wall component and panfungal marker beta-glucan. In addition, progress continues with use of polymerase chain reaction- or other nucleic acid- or molecular-based assays for diagnosis of either specific or generic IFIs, although the various methods must be better standardized before any of these approaches can be more fully implemented into the medical setting. Investigators are also beginning to explore the possibility of combining newer surrogate markers with each other or with more standard diagnostic approaches to improve sensitivity, specificity, and capacity for earlier diagnosis, at a time when fungal burden is still relatively low and more responsive to antifungal therapy.","['Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis']",['Ostrosky-Zeichner L'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Medical School, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The pathogenesis of MDS is exceedingly complex and involves the hematopoietic stem cells/hematopoietic precursors, bone marrow microenvironment, and complex interaction between these components. The diagnostic strategy in MDS has evolved significantly over the years from a strategy based almost exclusively on peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspirate morphology to the integrated approach used in the 2001 and 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification schemes. In parallel with the diagnostic approach, evolution has occurred in the prognostic assessment and evaluation of treatment response. The prognostic assessment now includes both disease-related factors and patient-specific characteristics such as nonhematologic comorbidities. All these developments are particularly important considering the ever-increasing treatment options available for MDS. This review focuses on the diagnostic approach to MDS and highlights recent developments in the pathogenesis as well as select clinical advances. We present the overview of the minimal diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of MDS, the WHO classification scheme, and briefly address the risk stratification.","['Zhou, Jiehao', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Czader, Magdalena B']","['Zhou J', 'Orazi A', 'Czader MB']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/Indiana University Health Pathology Laboratory, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,,IM,"['Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology']",2011/12/27 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/12/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0740-2570(11)00104-3 [pii]', '10.1053/j.semdp.2011.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 2011 Nov;28(4):258-72. doi: 10.1053/j.semdp.2011.08.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a 65 sample training set, from a cohort of 131 patients, we identified the best clinical models to predict time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS). To identify individual genes or combinations in the training set with expression related to prognosis, we cross-validated univariate and multivariate models to predict TTT. We identified four gene sets (5, 6, 12, or 13 genes) to construct multivariate prognostic models. By optimizing each gene set on the training set, we constructed 11 models to predict the time from diagnosis to treatment. Each model also predicted OS and added value to the best clinical models. To determine which contributed the most value when added to clinical variables, we applied the Akaike Information Criterion. Two genes were consistently retained in the models with clinical variables: SKI (v-SKI avian sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and SLAMF1 (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1; CD150). We optimized a two-gene model and validated it on an independent test set of 66 samples.

The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 oncoprotein tax controls forkhead box O4 activity through degradation by the proteasome. J. Virol. 85(13), 6480-6491 (2011). This study examines downstream signaling events of PI3K/AKT in the context of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. The authors have demonstrated that the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the FoxO4 transcription factor. Phosphorylation by AKT is requisite for Tax-induced FoxO4 degradation since mutation of the AKT phosphorylation sites abrogates FoxO4 degradation. Furthermore, Tax enhances the interaction between FoxO4 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 which presumably leads to FoxO4 ubiquitination. Consistently, knockdown of MDM2 with a shRNA plasmid attenuates FoxO4 ubiquitination, revealing an important role for MDM2 in Tax-induced FoxO4 ubiquitination. Finally, Tax represses FoxO4 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, the findings by Oteiza et al. suggest that Tax inactivates the tumor suppressor FoxO4 downstream of PI3K/AKT, which may play a role in HTLV-1-induced oncogenesis.","['Shembade, Noula', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Shembade N', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10 Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Future Virol,Future virology,101278124,,,,2011/12/24 06:00,2011/12/24 06:01,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/fvl.11.94 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Virol. 2011 Oct;6(10):1165-1168. doi: 10.2217/fvl.11.94.,"['P01 CA128115-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM083143/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA128115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135362-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3242375,,['NIHMS342661'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We speculated that increased antiapoptotic signaling desensitized the pregnant uterine myocyte to the apoptotic action of uterine CASP3. This current study examines the mechanism by which the pregnant myocyte gains resistance to the apoptotic effects of increased uterine CASP3. Using both primary human pregnant fundal myometrial cultures and the telomerase-immortalized human uterine myocyte cell line (hTERT) as our model systems, uterine myocytes were exposed to UV irradiation and Fas ligand to stimulate both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Stimulation of either the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways resulted in elevated levels of uterine myocyte CASP3. However, apoptotic cell death was restricted to CASP3 activated by intrinsic stimulation via UV light. In contrast Fas ligand-mediated CASP3 activation was accompanied by increased antiapoptotic signaling mimicking our in vivo observations in the pregnant mouse uterus. Using small interfering RNA to inhibit antiapoptotic signaling, we determined the ability of the human uterine myocyte to resist apoptotic cell death in the absence of the prosurvival, antiapoptotic signaling. Accordingly, suppression of antiapoptotic signaling specifically mediated by myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 was sufficient to sensitize the uterine myocyte to undergo apoptotic cell death. These data demonstrate that elevated myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 levels are sufficient to confer apoptotic resistance on the human uterine myocyte despite highly elevated levels of active CASP3.","['Stephenson-Famy, Alyssa', 'Marks, Jason', 'Suresh, Arvind', 'Caritis, Stanley N', 'Simhan, Hygraiv', 'Jeyasuria, Pancharatnam', 'Condon, Jennifer C']","['Stephenson-Famy A', 'Marks J', 'Suresh A', 'Caritis SN', 'Simhan H', 'Jeyasuria P', 'Condon JC']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Women's Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111222,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism/*physiology', 'Catalase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Muscle Cells/enzymology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Uterus/*cytology']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2011-1282 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2011-1282 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Feb;26(2):320-30. doi: 10.1210/me.2011-1282.

Here, we studied the biology of Bcr-Abl positive leukemia-initiating cells in the spleen, using an inducible transgenic mouse model of CML. Disease kinetics showed greater increases of immature leukemic cells in spleen vs bone marrow (BM). To assess how Bcr-Abl alters the behavior of spleen-derived CML cells, we transplanted these cells either before ('pre-uninduced') or 44 days after ('pre-induced') expression of the oncogene. Mice transplanted with pre-induced spleen cells showed significantly increased neutrophilia and splenomegaly compared with mice receiving pre-uninduced spleen cells, suggesting that Bcr-Abl expression in the donors had increased splenic tumor burden. However, pre-induction also altered the biology of these cells, as shown by a striking increase in erythropoietic potential. These results differ from those of BM-derived CML stem cells where pre-induction of Bcr-Abl had previously been shown to decrease disease transplantability. Moreover, splenic cells were less sensitive to imatinib than BM cells. In conclusion, Bcr-Abl alters the biology of splenic leukemic stem cells by a cell-autonomous mechanism, but the disease phenotype is also influenced by the microenvironment of these cells.","['Schemionek, M', 'Spieker, T', 'Kerstiens, L', 'Elling, C', 'Essers, M', 'Trumpp, A', 'Berdel, W E', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Koschmieder, S']","['Schemionek M', 'Spieker T', 'Kerstiens L', 'Elling C', 'Essers M', 'Trumpp A', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111223,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011366 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.366 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1030-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.366.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that human primary FL and DLBCL cells expressed complete and functional IL-23 and IL-27 receptors (R) and that IL-23 and IL-27 exerted anti-tumor activities in vitro and in vivo through different and complementary mechanisms. In vivo studies using severe combined immunodeficiency /non-obese diabetic mice-injected subcutaneously with human SU-DHL-4 cell line revealed that IL-23 inhibited directly tumor-cell proliferation, whereas IL-27 impaired the angiogenic program of lymphoma cells resulting in strong reduction of cell growth. In addition, combined treatment of IL-23 and IL-27 amplified the anti-tumor effects in vivo as compared with administration of each cytokine alone. These anti-tumor mechanisms were confirmed by in vitro experiments performed with primary lymphoma cells and cell lines. Our results strongly encourage the development of future clinical trials to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of the IL-23 and IL-27 in lymphoma patients.","['Cocco, C', 'Di Carlo, E', 'Zupo, S', 'Canale, S', 'Zorzoli, A', 'Ribatti, D', 'Morandi, F', 'Ognio, E', 'Airoldi, I']","['Cocco C', 'Di Carlo E', 'Zupo S', 'Canale S', 'Zorzoli A', 'Ribatti D', 'Morandi F', 'Ognio E', 'Airoldi I']","['AIRC Laboratory of Immunology and Tumors, Department of Experimental and Laboratory Medicine, G Gaslini Institute, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111223,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenic Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chickens', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-17/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-23/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011363 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.363 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1365-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.363.

The increased risk has been seen both in Africans and African Americans. Similarly, an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies in blacks compared with whites has been noted after adjusting for socioeconomic and other risk factors, suggesting a genetic predisposition. The higher risk of multiple myeloma in blacks is likely a result of the higher prevalence of the premalignant MGUS stage; there are no data to suggest that blacks have a higher progression rate of MGUS to myeloma. Studies are emerging that suggest the baseline cytogenetic characteristics, and progression may differ by race. In contrast, to the increased risk noted in blacks, studies suggest that the risk may be lower in certain racial and ethnic groups, notably persons from Japan and Mexico. We review the literature on racial disparity in the prevalence, pathogenesis and progression of MGUS and multiple myeloma between blacks and whites. We also discuss future directions for research that could inform management of these conditions and positively influence patient outcomes.","['Greenberg, A J', 'Vachon, C M', 'Rajkumar, S V']","['Greenberg AJ', 'Vachon CM', 'Rajkumar SV']","['Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111223,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)'],IM,"['African Americans', 'Blacks', 'Disease Progression', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/blood', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*ethnology/etiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*ethnology/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Whites']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011368 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.368 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):609-14. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.368.

PN can be caused by MM itself, either by the effects of the monoclonal protein or in the form of radiculopathy from direct compression, and particularly by certain therapies, including bortezomib, thalidomide, vinca alkaloids and cisplatin. Clinical evaluation has shown that up to 20% of MM patients have PN at diagnosis and as many as 75% may experience treatment-emergent PN during therapy. The incidence, symptoms, reversibility, predisposing factors and etiology of treatment-emergent PN vary among MM therapies, with PN incidence also affected by the dose, schedule and combinations of potentially neurotoxic agents. Effective management of treatment-emergent PN is critical to minimize the incidence and severity of this complication, while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Herein, the state of knowledge regarding treatment-emergent PN in MM patients and current management practices are outlined, and recommendations regarding optimal strategies for PN management during MM treatment are provided. These strategies include early and regular monitoring with neurological evaluation, with dose modification and treatment discontinuation as indicated. Areas requiring further research include the development of MM-specific, patient-focused assessment tools, pharmacogenomic analysis of patient DNA, and trials to assess the efficacy of pharmacological interventions.","['Richardson, P G', 'Delforge, M', 'Beksac, M', 'Wen, P', 'Jongen, J L', 'Sezer, O', 'Terpos, E', 'Munshi, N', 'Palumbo, A', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Moreau, P', 'Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Lee, J H', 'Cavo, M', 'Merlini, G', 'Voorhees, P', 'Chng, W J', 'Mazumder, A', 'Usmani, S', 'Einsele, H', 'Comenzo, R', 'Orlowski, R', 'Vesole, D', 'Lahuerta, J J', 'Niesvizky, R', 'Siegel, D', 'Mateos, M-V', 'Dimopoulos, M', 'Lonial, S', 'Jagannath, S', 'Blade, J', 'Miguel, J San', 'Morgan, G', 'Anderson, K C', 'Durie, B G M', 'Sonneveld, P']","['Richardson PG', 'Delforge M', 'Beksac M', 'Wen P', 'Jongen JL', 'Sezer O', 'Terpos E', 'Munshi N', 'Palumbo A', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Harousseau JL', 'Moreau P', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Lee JH', 'Cavo M', 'Merlini G', 'Voorhees P', 'Chng WJ', 'Mazumder A', 'Usmani S', 'Einsele H', 'Comenzo R', 'Orlowski R', 'Vesole D', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Niesvizky R', 'Siegel D', 'Mateos MV', 'Dimopoulos M', 'Lonial S', 'Jagannath S', 'Blade J', 'Miguel JS', 'Morgan G', 'Anderson KC', 'Durie BG', 'Sonneveld P']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. paul_richardson@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111223,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Boronic Acids/adverse effects', 'Bortezomib', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011346 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.346 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):595-608. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.346.

A rare and relatively quiescent cell type, HSCs are, on entry into cell cycle fated to self-renew, undergo apoptosis or differentiate to progenitors (HPCs) that eventually yield specific classes of blood cells. Disruption of these HSC fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC fate decisions and how these processes are undermined in leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect.

However, an appropriate systemic treatment for central nervous system infiltration of this disease is still lacking.

The goal of this review is to summarize the spectrum of neurologic derangements linked to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to raise clinicians' awareness to recognize the possibility of such associations.","['Lopes da Silva, Rodrigo']",['Lopes da Silva R'],"['Hospital Santo Antonio dos Capuchos - CHLC, Lisboa, Portugal. ronolosi@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111221,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",2011/12/24 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00581-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Jun;12(3):164-79. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.005.

Thermodynamic study indicated that the reactions of both anthraquinone-DNA systems are predominantly entropically driven. Furthermore, the binding mechanisms on the reaction of the two anthraquinones with DNA and the effect of ionic strength on the fluorescence property of the system have also been investigated. The results of the experiments indicated that the binding modes of quinizarin and danthron with DNA were evaluated to be groove binding. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of both compounds against human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line and DNA cleavage were investigated.

Herein, we report on a 17-year-old male with bilateral hip pain caused by adductor pyomyositis before beginning the treatment course of CML. CML was diagnosed by bone marrow chromosome study and was treated initially with imatinib but switched to hydroxyurea 5 days later because of poor cytoreduction response. Subsequently, white blood cell counts decreased gradually; however, the hyperleukocytosis condition resolved very slowly again until we switched back to imatinib use on the 40(th) day of hospitalization. Pyomyositis was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. Oxacillin was administered to cover Staphylococcus aureus, the most common pathogen of pyomyositis. Bilateral hip pain improved within 72 hours after antibiotic usage, but follow-up magnetic resonance imaging after 15 days of treatment revealed well-defined abscess and osteomyelitis of both femoral heads. Abscess incision and drainage were performed, and cultures of the drained pus grew no microorganisms. The patient completed 5 weeks of oxacillin treatment after the operation and recovered with a full range of motion of both hips. There was no residual disability. This is the first report of bilateral hip pain caused by pyomyositis as the initial presentation of CML.

We investigated the incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment outcome and long-term follow-up of 213 patients with chronic phase CML treated with IM according to the European LeukemiaNet guidelines. Nine patients, eight of whom received IM as first-line therapy, developed SBP (4.2% of the total). They tended to have low or intermediate risk Sokal scores at diagnosis, a predominance of the lymphoid phenotype and a short interval from ""optimal"" response to the development of BP. Five of the nine patients with SBP are alive in complete molecular remission; however, all of them underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The cumulative incidence of SBP for the patients who received IM as first-line therapy was 5.9% and the 2-year overall survival of the nine patients who developed SBP was 56%. Despite the improved outcome for patients with SBP receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and transplant, many of these patients are not salvaged with these therapies.

Chest CT showed nodular consolidations and cavitary lesions in both lungs. Bronchial biopsy revealed necrotic hyphae but it was negative for Aspergillus by culture. Serum was positive for antibodies to Aspergillus, but it was negative for antigens. A thoracoscopic lung biopsy of the upper left lobe revealed necrosis of lung tissue, with acute and chronic inflammation of the cavity wall and the presence of hyphae consistent with Aspergillus species. CONCLUSION: Although confirmation of the diagnosis is difficult, a combination of characteristic clinical, radiological and histological findings and either serological results positive for Aspergillus or the isolation of Aspergillus from respiratory samples are highly indicative of CNPA.","['Lovrenski, Aleksandra', 'Panjkovic, Milana', 'Eri, Zivka', 'Klem, Istvan', 'Povazan, Djordje', 'Ilincic, Dejan', 'Milic, Miljan']","['Lovrenski A', 'Panjkovic M', 'Eri Z', 'Klem I', 'Povazan D', 'Ilincic D', 'Milic M']","['Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Center for Pathology, Sremska Kamenica, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Radiography']",2011/12/24 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/12/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2011 Nov;68(11):988-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was evaluation and analysis of cytogenetic response in different intervals and risk groups as well as finding association between pre-treatment characteristics and later probability of achievement of major cytogenetic response. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated at our institution from June 2006 to December 2009. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for patients during treatment with imatinib was 25.7 months (range, 12-42 months). A complete hematologic response was achieved in all of the analyzed patients within 6 months from the start of the treatment. The major cytogenetic response rate was 81.8%, and the complete cytogenetic response rate was 72.7%. The patients with low or moderate relative risk had the rate of complementary achieving major and complete cytogenetic response of 75-90%. A multivariate analysis identified the following independent prognostic factors for achieving major cytogenetic response: the absence of splenomegaly, white blood cell count less than 10 x 10(9)/L, the platelet count less than 450 x 10(9)/L, the presence of less than 5% of bone marrow blasts and basophils, the absence of blasts in peripheral blood, the presence of less than 7% of basophils in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Patients who early achieve complete and major cytogenetic response as well as those with low and moderate relative risk have a higher rate of achieving and maintaining complete cytogenetic response.

At 20 years of follow-up, serum-inducible TrpRS phosphorylation found years before healthy donors (3/15) diagnosed with PC, CRC, or leukemia. I have examined a specificity of serum-inducible TrpRS phosphorylation and found, surprisingly, that serine phosphorylation of unfolded TrpRS is stimulated by anti-TrpRS rabbit antisera but is unaffected by rabbit nonimmune sera and antisera to other antigens. Anti-TrpRS immunoglobulin G (IgG) inhibits phosphorylation of full-length TrpRS and stimulates phosphorylation of its 20-kDa fragment. Phosphorylation of this fragment is stimulated also by CS but not NS. 2-Mercaptoethanol and cyclic AMP exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on TrpRS phosphorylation. Anti-TrpRS sera and casein act as chaperones increasing TrpRS phosphorylation through refolding. Histone-specific protein kinase activity in CS (n = 44) and anti-TrpRS sera was lower than that in NS (n = 11), rabbit nonimmune sera and antisera to other antigens. TrpRS inhibitors, tryptamine, and tryptophanol stimulate in vivo accumulation of enzymatically inactive, nonphosphorylated, aggregated and anti-TrpRS IgG refoldable TrpRS. Phosphorylation of postsurgical tissues (n = 18) reveals TrpRS in ovarian cancer (OVC) and CC but not in normal placenta and liver. In OVC, TrpRS phosphorylation increase correlates with elevated tryptophan-dependent ATP-inorganic pyrophosphate exchange. Although not inducing cancer, TrpRS triggers signaling concomitant with cancer.","['Paley, Elena L']",['Paley EL'],"['College of Allied Health and Nursing, Nova Southeastern University, Kendall Campus, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111201,United States,Transl Oncol,Translational oncology,101472619,,,,2011/12/23 06:00,2011/12/23 06:01,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1593/tlo.11220 [doi]'],ppublish,Transl Oncol. 2011 Dec;4(6):377-89. doi: 10.1593/tlo.11220.

The osteoblastic niche localized at the inner surface of the bone cavity might serve as a reservoir for long-term HSC storage in a quiescent state. Whereas the vascular niche, which consists of sinusoidal endothelial cell lining blood vessel, provides an environment for short-term HSC proliferation and differentiation. Both niches act together to maintain hematopoietic homeostasis. In this paper, we provide some principles applying to the hematopoietic niches, which will be useful in the study and understanding of other stem cell niches. We will discuss altered microenvironment signaling leading to myeloid lineage disease.

Elevated corticosteroid levels, due to stress, reproducibly triggers reactivation from latency in the field. A single intravenous injection of the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone (DEX) to latently infected calves consistently induces reactivation from latency. Lytic cycle viral gene expression is detected in sensory neurons within 6 h after DEX treatment of latently infected calves. These observations suggested that DEX stimulated expression of cellular genes leads to lytic cycle viral gene expression and productive infection. In this study, a commercially available assay-Bovine Gene Chip-was used to compare cellular gene expression in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of calves latently infected with BHV-1 versus DEX-treated animals. Relative to TG prepared from latently infected calves, 11 cellular genes were induced more than 10-fold 3 h after DEX treatment. Pentraxin three, a regulator of innate immunity and neurodegeneration, was stimulated 35- to 63-fold after 3 or 6 h of DEX treatment. Two transcription factors, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and Slug were induced more than 15-fold 3 h after DEX treatment. PLZF or Slug stimulated productive infection 20- or 5-fold, respectively, and Slug stimulated the late glycoprotein C promoter more than 10-fold. Additional DEX-induced transcription factors also stimulated productive infection and certain viral promoters. These studies suggest that DEX-inducible cellular transcription factors and/or signaling pathways stimulate lytic cycle viral gene expression, which subsequently leads to successful reactivation from latency in a small subset of latently infected neurons.","['Workman, Aspen', 'Eudy, James', 'Smith, Lynette', 'da Silva, Leticia Frizzo', 'Sinani, Devis', 'Bricker, Halie', 'Cook, Emily', 'Doster, Alan', 'Jones, Clinton']","['Workman A', 'Eudy J', 'Smith L', 'da Silva LF', 'Sinani D', 'Bricker H', 'Cook E', 'Doster A', 'Jones C']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111221,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics/metabolism/*veterinary/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/*metabolism/virology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects', '*Virus Latency/drug effects']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06143-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06143-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(5):2459-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06143-11.

Lentivirus vectors pseudotyped with the baculovirus envelope glycoprotein GP64 have been shown to acquire more potent gene transduction than those with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope glycoprotein G. However, there are conflicting hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of the entry of AcMNPV. Moreover, the mechanisms of the entry of pseudotyped viruses bearing GP64 into mammalian cells are not well characterized. Determination of the entry mechanisms of AcMNPV and the pseudotyped viruses bearing GP64 is important for future development of viral vectors that can deliver genes into mammalian cells with greater efficiency and specificity. In this study, we generated three pseudotyped VSVs, NPVpv, VSVpv, and MLVpv, bearing envelope proteins of AcMNPV, VSV, and murine leukemia virus, respectively. Depletion of membrane cholesterol by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which removes cholesterol from cellular membranes, inhibited GP64-mediated internalization in a dose-dependent manner but did not inhibit attachment to the cell surface. Treatment of cells with inhibitors or the expression of dominant-negative mutants for dynamin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis abrogated the internalization of AcMNPV and NPVpv into mammalian cells, whereas inhibition of caveolin-mediated endocytosis did not. Furthermore, inhibition of macropinocytosis reduced GP64-mediated internalization. These results suggest that cholesterol in the plasma membrane, dynamin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis play crucial roles in the entry of viruses bearing baculovirus GP64 into mammalian cells.","['Kataoka, Chikako', 'Kaname, Yuuki', 'Taguwa, Shuhei', 'Abe, Takayuki', 'Fukuhara, Takasuke', 'Tani, Hideki', 'Moriishi, Kohji', 'Matsuura, Yoshiharu']","['Kataoka C', 'Kaname Y', 'Taguwa S', 'Abe T', 'Fukuhara T', 'Tani H', 'Moriishi K', 'Matsuura Y']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/virology', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/instrumentation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mammals/metabolism/*virology', 'Nucleopolyhedroviruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Spodoptera', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06704-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06704-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(5):2610-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06704-11.

We performed a systematic review of the randomized clinical trials addressing this question. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, BIOSIS, PAPERSFIRST, PROCEEDINGS, clinical trials registries, and bibliographies of relevant studies for randomized clinical trials comparing myeloablative chemotherapy with ASCT to any chemotherapy in adults with untreated advanced FL. We performed a meta-analysis using random effects models to estimate overall survival, event-free survival, and risks of adverse outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated by using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Seven trials proved eligible, four of which provided data from 941 patients that could be included in a meta-analysis and three of which remain unpublished. In two of the trials, patients in both arms received rituximab during the induction treatment. Moderate quality evidence from the three trials that reported overall survival (n = 701 patients) suggests that ASCT did not result in improved overall survival (hazard ratio of death = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.33). Low-quality evidence from the four trials of 941 patients suggests improvement in event-free survival in favor of ASCT (hazard ratio of death = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.82) with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 80%). Adverse outcomes of treatment-related mortality, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and solid tumors were not different between the two arms (relative risk [RR] of treatment-related mortality = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.29 to 3.70; RR of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia = 2.19, 95% CI = 0.45 to 10.55; I(2) = 48%; and RR of solid tumors = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.33 to 5.08). The absolute risk of death from treatment was 14 per 1000 patients for those who received chemotherapy and 15 per 1000 for those who received ASCT (range = 4-52). CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that high-dose therapy and ASCT as part of FL initial treatment does not improve overall survival. Future trials of ASCT in the context of current chemoimmunotherapy approaches to FL are needed.","['Al Khabori, Murtadha', 'de Almeida, John R', 'Guyatt, Gordon H', 'Kuruvilla, John', 'Crump, Michael']","['Al Khabori M', 'de Almeida JR', 'Guyatt GH', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Crump M']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20111221,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Odds Ratio', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Selection Bias', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Failure']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['djr450 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djr450 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Jan 4;104(1):18-28. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djr450.

Here we investigated whether this immune dysfunction plays a pathologic role in the progression of early stage disease patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We carried out eight-color immunophenotyping analysis in a cohort of 110 untreated early stage CLL patients and 22 age-matched healthy donors and correlated our findings with clinical outcome data. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in CLL patients. Only the CD4(+) subset showed significantly increased effector memory cells (T(EM) and T(EMRA)) in the whole cohort (P = 0.004 and P = 0.04, respectively). However, patients with inverted CD4:CD8 ratios (52 of 110) showed preferential expansion of the CD8 compartment, with a skewing of CD8(+) T(EMRA) (P = 0.03) coupled with increased percentage of CD57(+)CD28(-)CD27(-) T cells (P = 0.008) and PD-1 positivity (P = 0.027), consistent with a replicative senescence phenotype. Furthermore, inverted CD4:CD8 ratios were associated with shorter lymphocyte doubling time (P = 0.03), shorter time to first treatment (P = 0.03), and reduced progression-free survival (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the emergence of CD8(+)PD-1(+) replicative senescence phenotype in early stage CLL patients is associated with more aggressive clinical disease. Importantly, these findings were independent of tumor cell prognostic markers and could not be accounted for by patient age, changes in regulatory T-cell frequency, or cytomegalovirus serostatus (n = 217).","['Nunes, Claudia', 'Wong, Ryan', 'Mason, Malcolm', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Man, Stephen', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Nunes C', 'Wong R', 'Mason M', 'Fegan C', 'Man S', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Infection, Cardiff University, Wales, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cellular Senescence/immunology', '*Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/biosynthesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2630 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2630 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Feb 1;18(3):678-87. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2630.

The purpose of this case is to describe pseudohyperkalemia attributed to malignant leucocytosis in a patient with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and tumor lysis syndrome. Methods for determination of pseudohyperkalemia are discussed. SUMMARY: A 75-year-old male with progressive chronic lymphoblastic leukemia was hospitalized for medical evaluation and chemotherapy administration. Notable laboratory findings included white blood cell count of 479 x 10(3) cells/microL (4.00 x 10(3) cells/microL-10.80 x 10(3) cells/microL) with 95% lymphocytes (20%-50%) and 5% blasts (zero) present in the differential, serum potassium 9.8 mM/L (3.4 mM/L-5.0 mM/L), uric acid of 11.8 mg/dL (3.5 mg/dL-8.0 mg/dL), serum creatinine 1.47 mg/dL (0.60 mg/dL-1.30 mg/dL), and lactate dehydrogenase of 2529 IU/L (100 IU/L-220 IU/L). The patient was anemic (Hb 7.6 g/dL (14.0 g/dL-18.0 g/dL)) and thrombocytopenic (17 x 10(3) platelets/muL (140 x 10(3) platelets/muL-400 x 10(3) platelets/muL)). There were no electrocardiographic findings indicating systemic hyperkalemia. Repeat analysis of the blood potassium level using a heparinized tube assayed immediately after specimen collection demonstrated a plasma potassium level 4.1 mM/L. Subsequent analysis of specimens using similar methodology demonstrated potassium results within the normal limits despite continued laboratory evidence of pseudohyperkalemia. Based on the patient's conscious and interactive condition, ECG findings, and normal plasma potassium level following immediate analysis, the diagnosis of pseudohyperkalemia was made. Laboratory findings of pseudohyperkalemia persisted throughout the period of leukocytosis. CONCLUSION: This case describes pseudohyperkalemia attributed to malignant leucocytosis in a patient with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). Practitioners should consider pseudohyperkalemia as the underlying cause of elevated potassium levels in patients with malignant leucocytosis who do not have signs or symptoms of systemic hyperkalemia.","['Kintzel, Polly E', 'Scott, William L']","['Kintzel PE', 'Scott WL']","['Department of Pharmacy, MC 001, 100 Michigan St, NE, Grand Rapids, MI 49503, USA. polly.kintzel@spectrumhealth.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111221,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,IM,"['Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*blood']",2011/12/23 06:00,2013/07/19 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155211429885 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155211429885 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2012 Dec;18(4):432-5. doi: 10.1177/1078155211429885.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment intensity is predictive of projected iron burden resulting from PRBC transfusions among survivors of several forms of childhood cancer. PROCEDURE: This retrospective cohort study involved patients treated at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) between June 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009. Clinical/demographic data were abstracted from medical records. Treatment Intensity Level was determined for each patient using a published scale. Adjusted cumulative PRBC transfusion volume for each patient (ml/kg) was used to compute the adjusted total iron burden (mg/kg) based upon the average hematocrit of the product. RESULTS: Median age of the cohort (n = 214) was 7.9 years (range 0.2-20.2). One hundred and fourteen (53.3%) were male and 129 (60.3%) were Hispanic/Latino. Diagnoses included acute leukemia and six solid tumors, management of which represents a range of cancer treatment intensities. The number of transfusions, transfusion volumes, and projected iron burden were significantly increased and exceeded upper limits of normal among patients with higher treatment intensity. Multivariate analysis found younger age and lower hemoglobin at diagnosis to be associated with greater iron burden after adjusting for treatment intensity. CONCLUSION: Greater treatment intensity is associated with need for more PRBC transfusions, and thus increased risk of iron overload among childhood cancer survivors. Iron overload may represent another clinically significant late effect following childhood cancer treatment.","['Ruccione, Kathleen S', 'Mudambi, Kiran', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Fridey, Joy', 'Ghazarossian, Suzy', 'Freyer, David R']","['Ruccione KS', 'Mudambi K', 'Sposto R', 'Fridey J', 'Ghazarossian S', 'Freyer DR']","['LIFE Cancer Survivorship & Transition Program, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/etiology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iron Overload/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24046 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Oct;59(4):697-702. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24046.

METHODS: Children (</=18 years) diagnosed with ALL during the period 1995-2006, who are in first clinical remission, were included (n = 124). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provided LS-BMD at diagnosis (n = 46) and during continuation therapy. LS-BMD was expressed as Z scores based on local population norms. Regression analyses evaluated the risk of osteopenia (Z-score -1.01 to -1.99, osteoporosis (Z-score -2.00 or less) and fractures. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 14 0f 46 (30%) patients had osteopenia and 5 (11%) had osteoporosis; whereas, during continuation therapy, 47 of 124 (39.5%) patients had osteopenia, and 10 (8%) had osteoporosis. LS-BMD at diagnosis had a positive linear relationship with LS-BMD during continuation therapy (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.619, P < 0.0001). Multivariable analyses identified age >/=10 years and LS-BMD at diagnosis as independent predictors of LS-BMD during continuation therapy. Twenty-three (18.5%) patients developed fractures. Dexamethasone therapy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.31, 7.52, P = 0.01) and lower LS-BMD during the continuation therapy (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.8, P = 0.01) were independent predictors of fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and lower LS-BMD at diagnosis are predictors of lower LS-BMD during continuation therapy. Dexamethasone and lower LS-BMD during continuation therapy are associated with fractures. Using these variables it is feasible to develop a predictor model to define the risk of bony morbidity in children receiving ALL therapy.","['Rayar, Meera S', 'Nayiager, Trishana', 'Webber, Colin E', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Athale, Uma H']","['Rayar MS', 'Nayiager T', 'Webber CE', 'Barr RD', 'Athale UH']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111220,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', '*Osteoporosis/chemically induced/mortality', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Spinal Fractures/chemically induced/mortality']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24040 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):77-82. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24040.

We evaluated whether tumor necrosis following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is prognostic for survival in hepatoblastoma (HB). PROCEDURE: Primary tumors from children with newly diagnosed stage III and IV HB who underwent surgical resection following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated histologically for the extent of tumor necrosis (total diameter of necrotic and fibrotic tissue divided by total diameter of tumor). Clinical features, laboratory values, pathological features, treatment delivered, and vital status were recorded. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were evaluable. After a median of four cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy gross total surgical resection was achieved in 29 patients and complete resection documented by histology in 22 patients. Three-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the evaluable patients were 70.3 +/- 8.3% and 76.8 +/- 7.6%, respectively. Extent of tumor necrosis, platelet count at diagnosis, decline in serum alpha fetoprotein, and surgical margin status (positive vs. negative) were statistically significant predictors for both EFS and OS by univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses revealed that extent of tumor necrosis and surgical margin status predicted improved EFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Extent of tumor necrosis following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor in patients with newly diagnosed HB. Histological response may potentially be used in strategies to modify post-surgical therapy to improve survival in HB.","['Venkatramani, Rajkumar', 'Wang, Larry', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Dias, Dennis', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Malogolowkin, Marcio H', 'Mascarenhas, Leo']","['Venkatramani R', 'Wang L', 'Malvar J', 'Dias D', 'Sposto R', 'Malogolowkin MH', 'Mascarenhas L']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA. rvenkatramani@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111220,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)'],IM,"['Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hepatoblastoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', '*Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/therapeutic use']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24038 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):493-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24038.

In this study, tissue-specific eosinophil mRNA microarray analysis identified that CD22 transcript levels of murine gastrointestinal (GI) eosinophils are 10-fold higher than those of lung eosinophils. To confirm the mRNA data at the protein level, we developed a FACS-based protocol designed to phenotype live GI eosinophils isolated from the murine lamina propria. Indeed, we found that jejunum eosinophils expressed remarkably high levels of surface CD22, similar to levels found in B cells across multiple mouse strains. In contrast, CD22 was undetectable on eosinophils from the colon, blood, thymus, spleen, uterus, peritoneal cavity, and allergen-challenged lung. Eosinophils isolated from newborn mice did not express CD22 but subsequently upregulated CD22 expression to adult levels within the first 10 d after birth. The GI lamina propria from CD22 gene-targeted mice harbored more eosinophils than wild type control mice, whereas the GI eosinophil turnover rate was unaltered in the absence of CD22. Our findings identify a novel expression pattern and tissue eosinophilia-regulating function for the ""B cell-specific"" inhibitory molecule CD22 on GI eosinophils.","['Wen, Ting', 'Mingler, Melissa K', 'Blanchard, Carine', 'Wahl, Benjamin', 'Pabst, Oliver', 'Rothenberg, Marc E']","['Wen T', 'Mingler MK', 'Blanchard C', 'Wahl B', 'Pabst O', 'Rothenberg ME']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers', 'Eosinophilia/*prevention & control', 'Eosinophils/*chemistry', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*cytology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*analysis/genetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102222 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102222 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Feb 1;188(3):1075-82. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102222.

Using high-resolution SNP microarrays, we studied a total of 517 MPN and MDS patients in different disease stages, including 77 AML cases with previous history of MPN (N = 46) or MDS (N = 31). Frequent chromosomal deletions of variable sizes were detected, allowing the mapping of putative tumor suppressor genes involved in the leukemic transformation process. We detected frequent deletions on the short arm of chromosome 6 (del6p). The common deleted region on 6p mapped to a 1.1-Mb region and contained only the JARID2 gene--member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). When we compared the frequency of del6p between chronic and leukemic phase, we observed a strong association of del6p with leukemic transformation (P = 0.0033). Subsequently, analysis of deletion profiles of other PRC2 members revealed frequent losses of genes such as EZH2, AEBP2, and SUZ12; however, the deletions targeting these genes were large. We also identified two patients with homozygous losses of JARID2 and AEBP2. We observed frequent codeletion of AEBP2 and ETV6, and similarly, SUZ12 and NF1. Using next generation exome sequencing of 40 patients, we identified only one somatic mutation in the PRC2 complex member SUZ12. As the frequency of point mutations in PRC2 members was found to be low, deletions were the main type of lesions targeting PRC2 complex members. Our study suggests an essential role of the PRC2 complex in the leukemic transformation of chronic myeloid disorders.","['Puda, Ana', 'Milosevic, Jelena D', 'Berg, Tiina', 'Klampfl, Thorsten', 'Harutyunyan, Ashot S', 'Gisslinger, Bettina', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Pieri, Lisa', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Kralovics, Robert']","['Puda A', 'Milosevic JD', 'Berg T', 'Klampfl T', 'Harutyunyan AS', 'Gisslinger B', 'Rumi E', 'Pietra D', 'Malcovati L', 'Elena C', 'Doubek M', 'Steurer M', 'Tosic N', 'Pavlovic S', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Pieri L', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Gisslinger H', 'Cazzola M', 'Kralovics R']","['Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (AEBP2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (JARID2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PHF19 protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22257 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Mar;87(3):245-50. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22257.

Previous studies have demonstrated that Src family kinases are required for the induction of B-ALL, but not for CML, which is induced by Bcr-Abl in mice. In contrast, it has been reported that Fyn is up-regulated in human CML-BC compared with CML-CP, implicating Fyn in the blast crisis transition. Here, we aimed to delineate the exact role of Fyn in the induction/progression of Ph(+) leukemias. We found that Fyn is expressed in mouse hematopoietic cells at varying stages of development, including c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells. Notably, Fyn is highly expressed in some of human lymphomas, but not in human Ph(+) leukemias including CML-BC. In mouse bone marrow transplantation models, mice transplanted with wild-type or Fyn-deficient bone marrow cells transduced with Bcr-Abl showed no differences in the development of B-ALL or CML-like diseases.

In this study, we examined the clinical and biological characteristics of 11 Japanese patients with T-PLL. Median age was 74 years, with male predominance. Median lymphocyte frequency was 85.3% in blood. Physical characteristics were splenomegaly (36.4%), tiny lymph adenopathy (63.6%), skin lesion (9.1%) and pleural effusion (27.3%). Median survival was 30.1 months, despite treatment with various chemotherapeutic modalities. Although complex chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 5 of 11 cases (45.5%), typical 14q32 and Xq28 abnormalities were not detected. TCL1A mRNA expression was observed in 6 of 11 cases (54.5%) on real-time quantitative PCR. In 5 of these 6 cases, flow cytometric analysis and/or immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of TCLA1 protein. Split signals for the TCL1 region on fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed rearrangement in 3 out of 7 cases evaluated. These cases corresponded to cases that were positive for TCL1A expression, suggesting that rearrangement of the TCL1 region induced high expression of TCL1A gene. In summary, a substantial number of T-PLL cases in Japan had abnormal expression of TCL1A, probably due to rearrangement of TCL1 region. Expression and/or rearrangement of TCL1A may, therefore, be a useful marker for diagnosing T-PLL, regardless of chromosomal abnormalities.","['Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Saitoh, Akio', 'Nakahashi, Hirotaka', 'Mitsui, Takeki', 'Koiso, Hiromi', 'Kim, Yoshitora', 'Uchiumi, Hideki', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Jimbo, Takahiro', 'Murayama, Kayoko', 'Sakura, Tohru', 'Murakami, Hirokazu', 'Karasawa, Masamitsu', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi']","['Yokohama A', 'Saitoh A', 'Nakahashi H', 'Mitsui T', 'Koiso H', 'Kim Y', 'Uchiumi H', 'Saitoh T', 'Handa H', 'Jimbo T', 'Murayama K', 'Sakura T', 'Murakami H', 'Karasawa M', 'Nojima Y', 'Tsukamoto N']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan. ayoko@gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111223,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-011-0986-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Jan;95(1):77-85. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0986-5.

A prospective case-control study of sporadic diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium infection was conducted on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Forty children with ALL on maintenance chemotherapy according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM-90) protocol and 45 sex- and age-matched controls were studied. The ALL group included 25 patients with acute diarrhea and 15 without diarrhea, and the control group included 30 children with acute diarrhea and 15 without. Collected stool specimens were examined using modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) and modified trichrome stains. Serum Cryptosporidium Parvum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Cryptosporidium oocysts, pathogenic Gram-negative organisms, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica were identified in the stool samples (fecal specimens) of six (24%), eight (32%), four (16%), and two (8%), respectively, of the 25 patients with ALL and actute diarrhea and in one (3%), two (6.5%), six (20%), and five (16.5%), respectively, of the 30 control patients with diarrhea. Serum IgG antibodies were positive in four of the six ALL patients and in one of the control group patients with Cryptosporidium diarrhea who tested positive for oocysts in the stool. Diarrhea duration and severity were greater in ALL patients with stool-positive Cryptosporidium oocysts than in those with non-Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea (p < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium infection should be considered in children with ALL presenting with prolonged or severe watery diarrhea during chemotherapy, especially those treated with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Since Cryptosporidium is not routinely tested for in stool examination, a MZN stain is recommended.","['Hassanein, S M A', 'Abd-El-Latif, M M S', 'Hassanin, O M', 'Abd-El-Latif, L M S', 'Ramadan, N I']","['Hassanein SM', 'Abd-El-Latif MM', 'Hassanin OM', 'Abd-El-Latif LM', 'Ramadan NI']","['Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, P.B. 11381, Abbassia Square, Cairo, Egypt. saharhassanein@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111222,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryptosporidiosis/immunology/*parasitology', 'Cryptosporidium parvum/*isolation & purification', 'Diarrhea/immunology/parasitology', 'Egypt', 'Entamoeba histolytica/isolation & purification', 'Feces/microbiology/parasitology', 'Female', 'Gastroenteritis/immunology/*parasitology', 'Giardia lamblia/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology/parasitology', 'Prospective Studies']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-011-0230-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2012 Jun;40(3):279-84. doi: 10.1007/s15010-011-0230-5.

It is an aggressive type of leukemia that is responsive to high-intensity, short-duration chemotherapy with complete remission possible in 75% to 90% of cases. The recognition and proper designation of BL is important because treatment differs from that of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). Burkitt's leukemia is separated by its typical morphologic features (blasts with typical French-American-British [FAB] L-3 morphology compared to FAB L-1/L-2 morphology in pre-B ALL) and a classic immunophenotype (blast positivity for CD45 [bright], CD20 [bright], CD10, CD19, surface immunoglobulin [SIg], Ig light chain restriction, and negative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT]) compared to pre-B ALL blasts (which are positive for CD45 [dim], CD10, CD19, and TdT and negative for CD20 and SIg). The diagnosis of Burkitt's leukemia is confirmed by the characteristic cytogenetic findings.The combination of Burkitt's morphology with precursor B-cell immunophenotype may present a diagnostic pitfall, resulting in delay of proper management.We describe such an atypical case in a 12-year-old girl and emphasize that correct classification and treatment starts with proper morphologic/immunophenotypic correlation, and the awareness of the overlapping features in some cases.","['Rawlinson, Neil J', 'Baker, Peter', 'Kahwash, Samir B']","['Rawlinson NJ', 'Baker P', 'Kahwash SB']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['R438224X32148L85 [pii]', '10.1532/LH96.11004 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2011 Dec;17(4):27-31. doi: 10.1532/LH96.11004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas Cdx2 exerts a tumor suppressor function in the gut, its abnormal ectopic expression in acute leukemia is associated to a pro-oncogenic function. To try to understand this duality, we have hypothesized that Cdx2 may interact with different protein partners in the two tissues and set up experiments to identify them by tandem affinity purification. We show here that Cdx2 interacts with the Ku heterodimer specifically in intestinal cells, but not in leukemia cells, via its homeodomain. Ku proteins do not affect Cdx2 transcriptional activity. However, Cdx2 inhibits in vivo and in vitro the DNA repair activity mediated by Ku proteins in intestinal cells. Whereas Cdx2 does not affect the recruitment of Ku proteins and DNA-PKcs into the DNA repair complex, it inhibits DNA-PKcs activity. Thus, we report here a new function of Cdx2, acting as an inhibitor of the DNA repair machinery, that may contribute to its tumor suppressor function specifically in the gut.","['Renouf, Benjamin', 'Soret, Christine', 'Saandi, Thoueiba', 'Delalande, Francois', 'Martin, Elisabeth', 'Vanier, Marie', 'Duluc, Isabelle', 'Gross, Isabelle', 'Freund, Jean-Noel', 'Domon-Dell, Claire']","['Renouf B', 'Soret C', 'Saandi T', 'Delalande F', 'Martin E', 'Vanier M', 'Duluc I', 'Gross I', 'Freund JN', 'Domon-Dell C']","['INSERM, U682, F-67200 Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (CDX2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA End-Joining Repair', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr1242 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr1242 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Apr;40(8):3456-69. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr1242.

METHODS: People diagnosed with BCC or SCC in 1980-2003 reported to the Tasmanian Cancer Registry, Australia, were followed-up by linkage within the registry, until diagnosis of a subsequent smoking-related cancer, death, or until 31 December 2003. Risk of developing a future smoking-related cancer was assessed using age Standardised Incidence Ratios (SIR). RESULTS: People diagnosed with SCC had an increased risk of lung cancer (men: SIR = 1.89, 95% confidence interval: 1.61-2.21; women: SIR = 2.04, 1.42-2.83) and all other smoking-related cancers (men: SIR = 1.38, 1.19-1.60; women: SIR = 1.78, 1.34-2.33).

Here, we show for the first time, that treatment with (-)-gossypol and multikinase inhibitor sorafenib synergistically suppresses the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (AI-PC) in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that sorafenib attenuates (-)-gossypol-induced Mcl-1 upregulation in AI-PCs. In this way, it serves as a potent chemosensitizer to affect cell death. Interestingly, (-)-gossypol and sorafenib induce cell death via two distinct pathways among different AI-PCs; DU145 cells via apoptosis and PC-3 via autophagy. The appointed death pathway may depend on the level of proapoptotic protein Bak, although the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 plays some role in it. DU145 cells with high Bak level prefer apoptosis induction, whereas PC-3 cells with low Bak prefer the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, inhibiting nondominant death pathways, that is, autophagy in DU145 and apoptosis in PC-3, enhances cell killing by (-)-gossypol/sorafenib combination therapy. Ultimately, our data expose a new action for sorafenib as an enhancer of (-)-gossypol-induced cell growth suppression and reveal a novel cell death mode by Bak activation manners in AI-PCs. These new insights may facilitate the rational design of clinical trials by selecting patients most likely to benefit from the Bcl-2-targeted molecular therapy.","['Lian, Jiqin', 'Ni, Zhenhong', 'Dai, Xufang', 'Su, Chang', 'Smith, Amber Rae', 'Xu, Liang', 'He, Fengtian']","['Lian J', 'Ni Z', 'Dai X', 'Su C', 'Smith AR', 'Xu L', 'He F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Third Military Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan, Shapingba, Chongqing 400038, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Androgens/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gossypol/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0559 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0559 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Feb;11(2):416-26. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0559.

Despite intensive efforts, no effective vaccine has been developed against ALV because of mutations that lead to resistant forms. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop antiviral agents for the treatment of ALV infections and RNA interference (RNAi) is considered an effective antiviral strategy. RESULTS: In this study, the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) proviral genome, including the gag genes, were treated as targets for RNAi. Four pairs of miRNA sequences were designed and synthesized that targeted different regions of the gag gene. The screened target (i.e., the gag genes) was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0-77.3%. To avoid the generation of escape variants during virus infection, expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs were constructed using the multi-target serial strategy (against different regions of the gag, pol, and env genes). Multi-target miRNAs were shown to play a synergistic role in the inhibition of ALV-J replication, with an inhibition efficiency of viral replication ranging from 85.0-91.2%. CONCLUSION: The strategy of multi-target miRNAs might be an effective method for inhibiting ALV replication and the acquisition of resistant mutations.","['Meng, Qing-Wen', 'Zhang, Zai-Ping', 'Wang, Wei', 'Tian, Jin', 'Xiao, Zhi-Guang']","['Meng QW', 'Zhang ZP', 'Wang W', 'Tian J', 'Xiao ZG']","[""State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, No, 427 Maduan Street, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, People's Republic of China. mqw@hvri.ac.cn""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111222,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Poultry Diseases/virology', '*RNA Interference', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/12/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-556 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-556 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Dec 22;8:556. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-556.,,PMC3296551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-araC exerts its anticancer activity mainly by inhibiting replicative DNA polymerases from further extension after its incorporation into DNA. DNA lesion bypass polymerases can manage the DNA lesions introduced by therapeutic agents, such as cisplatin and araC, therefore reduce the activity of these compounds. In this study, the potential relationships between the lesion bypass Y-family DNA polymerases eta, iota and kappa (pol eta, pol iota, and pol kappa) and T-araC were examined. Biochemical studies indicated that the triphosphate metabolite of T-araC is a less preferred substrate for the Y-family polymerases. In addition, cell viability study indicated that pol eta deficient human fibroblast cells were more sensitive to T-araC when compared with the normal human fibroblast cells.

Despite its initial discovery in the context of hematopoietic cells, little is yet known about the role of HPIP in hematopoiesis. Here, we show that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of HPIP in human CD34(+) cells enhances hematopoietic colony formation in vitro, whereas HPIP knockdown leads to a reduction in the number of such colonies. Interestingly, erythroid colony number was significantly higher in HPIP-overexpressing cells. In addition, forced expression of HPIP in K562 cells, a multipotent erythro-megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, led to an induction of erythroid differentiation. HPIP overexpression in both CD34(+) and K562 cells was associated with increased activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and corresponding treatment with a PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY-294002, caused a reduction in clonogenic progenitor number in HPIP-expressing CD34(+) cells and decreased K562 cell differentiation. Combined, these findings point to an important role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in mediating HPIP-induced effects on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, HPIP gene expression was found to be induced in K562 cells in response to erythroid differentiation signals such as DMSO and erythropoietin. The erythroid lineage-specific transcription factor GATA1 binds to the HPIP promoter and activates HPIP gene transcription in a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments revealed the association of CTCF with GATA1 indicating the recruitment of CTCF/GATA1 transcription factor complex onto the HPIP promoter. Together, this study provides evidence that HPIP is a target of GATA1 and CTCF in erythroid cells and plays an important role in erythroid differentiation by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.","['Manavathi, Bramanandam', 'Lo, Dennis', 'Bugide, Suresh', 'Dey, Oindrilla', 'Imren, Suzan', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Manavathi B', 'Lo D', 'Bugide S', 'Dey O', 'Imren S', 'Weiss MJ', 'Humphries RK']","['Molecular and Cellular Oncology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad-500046, India. manavathibsl@uohyd.ernet.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (PBXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)61219-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.289843 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Feb 17;287(8):5600-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.289843.

22187340,NLM,MEDLINE,20121018,20211021,1439-0973 (Electronic) 0300-8126 (Linking),40,3,2012 Jun,Mortality after bloodstream infections in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.,271-8,10.1007/s15010-011-0229-y [doi],"PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are frequent after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality after BSI in patients who undergo HSCT. METHODS: Patients who underwent HSCT between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2008 and developed BSI during the first year post-transplantation were included. Variables influencing overall mortality at 7 and 30 days after BSI were analysed. RESULTS: BSIs developed in 149 patients, within a median of 9 days after undergoing HSCT. Early and late mortality were 15 and 27%, respectively. Of the BSI, 54% were due to Gram-positive microorganisms, 33% were due to Gram-negative microogranisms, 10% were polymicrobial and 3% were fungal. The associated 7-and 30-day mortality was respectively 10 and 24% (Gram positive), 22 and 31% (Gram negative; Pseudomonas aeruginosa mortality 67%, all within 7 days), 13 and 27% (polymicrobial) and 40% (fungal, all within 7 days). Early mortality was higher in relapsed disease at HSCT (25.9%, p = 0.01), but lower in early (i.e. within 20 days of HSCT) BSI (11.7%, p = 0.03) and BSI due to Gram-positive infective agents (10%, p = 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed a higher mortality in late BSI [odds ratio (OR) 3.29, p = 0.03] and relapsed disease at HSCT (OR 2.2, p = 0.04). Late mortality was associated with the type of underlying disease (OR 0.44 for diseases other than acute leukaemia, p = 0.05) and its status (OR 6.04 for relapse at HSCT, p = 0.001). Appropriate empirical therapy was associated with lower early and late mortality in single Gram-negative BSI (16 vs. 45% for 7-day mortality, p = 0.09; 21 vs. 64% for 30-day mortality, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: BSIs are frequent during the first year after HSCT and are associated with a high mortality rate. The aetiology influenced early mortality, while the type and phase of the underlying disease played a pivotal role in late mortality. Appropriate empirical therapy is crucial in BSI due to Gram-negative infective agents.","['Mikulska, M', 'Del Bono, V', 'Bruzzi, P', 'Raiola, A M', 'Gualandi, F', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Viscoli, C']","['Mikulska M', 'Del Bono V', 'Bruzzi P', 'Raiola AM', 'Gualandi F', 'Van Lint MT', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Viscoli C']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, San Martino University Hospital, L.go R.

Hence, pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 are of therapeutic interest for AML. METHODS: The effects of inhibition of FLT3 activity by a novel potent FLT3 inhibitor, BPR1J-097, were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of BPR1J-097 required to inhibit FLT3 kinase activity ranged from 1 to 10 nM, and the 50% growth inhibition concentrations (GC(50)s) were 21+/-7 and 46+/-14 nM for MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cells, respectively. BPR1J-097 inhibited FLT3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation and triggered apoptosis in FLT3-driven AML cells. BPR1J-097 also showed favourable pharmacokinetic property and pronounced dose-dependent tumour growth inhibition and regression in FLT3-driven AML murine xenograft models. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that BPR1J-097 is a novel small molecule FLT-3 inhibitor with promising in vivo anti-tumour activities and suggest that BPR1J-097 may be further developed in preclinical and clinical studies as therapeutics in AML treatments.","['Lin, W-H', 'Jiaang, W-T', 'Chen, C-W', 'Yen, K-J', 'Hsieh, S-Y', 'Yen, S-C', 'Chen, C-P', 'Chang, K-Y', 'Chang, C-Y', 'Chang, T-Y', 'Huang, Y-L', 'Yeh, T-K', 'Chao, Y-S', 'Chen, C-T', 'Hsu, J T-A']","['Lin WH', 'Jiaang WT', 'Chen CW', 'Yen KJ', 'Hsieh SY', 'Yen SC', 'Chen CP', 'Chang KY', 'Chang CY', 'Chang TY', 'Huang YL', 'Yeh TK', 'Chao YS', 'Chen CT', 'Hsu JT']","['Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, No. 35, Keyan Road, Zhunan, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (N-(4-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N1-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea)', '0 (N1-(3-3-((phenylsulphonyl)amino)phenyl-1H-5-pyrazolyl)-4-(4-methylpiperazino)', 'benzamide)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011564 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.564 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Jan 31;106(3):475-81. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.564.

TP53 mutations were found in 141 of 234 (60%) and TP53 losses were identified in 94 of 234 (40%) CK-AMLs; in total, 164 of 234 (70%) cases had TP53 alterations. TP53-altered CK-AML were characterized by a higher degree of genomic complexity (aberrations per case, 14.30 vs 6.16; P < .0001) and by a higher frequency of specific copy number alterations, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, -16/16q-, -18/18q-, +1/+1p, and +11/+11q/amp11q13 approximately 25; among CK-AMLs, TP53-altered more frequently exhibited a monosomal karyotype (MK). Patients with TP53 alterations were older and had significantly lower complete remission rates, inferior event-free, relapse-free, and overall survival. In multivariable analysis for overall survival, TP53 alterations, white blood cell counts, and age were the only significant factors. In conclusion, TP53 is the most frequently known altered gene in CK-AML. TP53 alterations are associated with older age, genomic complexity, specific DNA copy number alterations, MK, and dismal outcome. In multivariable analysis, TP53 alteration is the most important prognostic factor in CK-AML, outweighing all other variables, including the MK category.","['Rucker, Frank G', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Teleanu, Veronica', 'Kett, Helena', 'Habdank, Marianne', 'Kugler, Carla-Maria', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Held, Gerhard', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Rucker FG', 'Schlenk RF', 'Bullinger L', 'Kayser S', 'Teleanu V', 'Kett H', 'Habdank M', 'Kugler CM', 'Holzmann K', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Held G', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Lubbert M', 'Frohling S', 'Zenz T', 'Krauter J', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Ganser A', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46018-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-375758 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 1;119(9):2114-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-375758.

A new treatment concept has arisen wherein CXCR4 may be an effective therapeutic target as an adjunct to treatment of hematologic neoplasms with chemo- and immunotherapy. In the present study, we developed pepducins, cell-penetrating lipopeptide antagonists of CXCR4, to interdict CXCL12-CXCR4 transmembrane signaling to intracellular G-proteins. We demonstrate that pepducins targeting the first (i1) or third (i3) intracellular loops of CXCR4 completely abrogate CXCL12-mediated cell migration of lymphocytic leukemias and lymphomas. Stromal-cell coculture protects lymphoma cells from apoptosis in response to treatment with the CD20-targeted Ab rituximab. However, combination treatment with CXCR4 pepducins and rituximab significantly increases the apoptotic effect of rituximab. Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing disseminated lymphoma xenografts with pepducins alone or in combination with rituximab significantly increased their survival. These data demonstrate that CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling can be effectively inhibited by cell-penetrating pepducins, which represents a potential new treatment strategy for lymphoid malignancies.","[""O'Callaghan, Katie"", 'Lee, Lydia', 'Nguyen, Nga', 'Hsieh, Mo-Ying', 'Kaneider, Nicole C', 'Klein, Andreas K', 'Sprague, Kellie', 'Van Etten, Richard A', 'Kuliopulos, Athan', 'Covic, Lidija']","[""O'Callaghan K"", 'Lee L', 'Nguyen N', 'Hsieh MY', 'Kaneider NC', 'Klein AK', 'Sprague K', 'Van Etten RA', 'Kuliopulos A', 'Covic L']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopeptides/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46075-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-347518 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 16;119(7):1717-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-347518.

An increase in the mean age is explained by the high HTLV-1 prevalence in elderly people over 64 years old in endemic areas (20%), and by the continual development of ATL from this large pool of HTLV-1 carriers.

Following DNA damage, Mcl-1 is rapidly and efficiently targeted to the 26S proteasome through the action of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Tumors having acquired lesions that lead to stabilization of Mcl-1 are highly aggressive and have a poorer prognosis. Herein, we further characterize an additional mechanism of Mcl-1 proteolysis that is proteasome-independent but mitochondrial-dependent. A mitochondrial targeting signal located in the N terminus of Mcl-1 is essential for targeting Mcl-1 to this alternative degradative avenue. We demonstrate that the Akt/mTORC1 survival pathway protects Mcl-1 from mitochondrial-dependent proteolysis. Disrupting Mcl-1 inner mitochondrial targeting improves the pro-survival capacity of Mcl-1 both ex vivo and in vivo in the well-characterized mouse Emu-Myc lymphoma model.

Early gene expression response implies a dose-dependent dual mechanism of action of prednisolone too, something reflected on cell state upon 72 h of treatment. METHODS: In this work, a generic, computational microarray data analysis framework is proposed, in order to examine the hypothesis, whether CCRF-CEM cells exhibit an intrinsic or acquired mechanism of resistance and investigate the molecular imprint of this, upon prednisolone treatment. The experimental design enables the examination of both the dose (0 nM, 10 nM, 22 uM, 700 uM) effect of glucocorticoid exposure and the dynamics (early and late, namely 4 h, 72 h) of the molecular response of the cells at the transcriptomic layer. RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that CCRF-CEM cells may attain a mixed mechanism of response to glucocorticoids, however, with a clear preference towards an intrinsic mechanism of resistance. Specifically, at 4 h, prednisolone appeared to down-regulate apoptotic genes. Also, low and high prednisolone concentrations up-regulates genes related to metabolism and signal-transduction in both time points, thus favoring cell proliferative actions. In addition, regulation of NF-kappaB-related genes implies an inherent mechanism of resistance through the established link of NF-kappaB inflammatory role and GC-induced resistance. The analysis framework applied here highlights prednisolone-activated regulatory mechanisms through identification of early responding sets of genes. On the other hand, study of the prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids (72 h exposure) highlights the effect of homeostatic feedback mechanisms of the treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it appears that CCRF-CEM cells in this study exhibit a diversified, combined pattern of intrinsic and acquired resistance to prednisolone, with a tendency towards inherent resistant characteristics, through activation of different molecular courses of action.","['Sifakis, Emmanouil G', 'Lambrou, George I', 'Prentza, Andriana', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros', 'Koutsouris, Dimitris', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, Fotini', 'Chatziioannou, Aristotelis A']","['Sifakis EG', 'Lambrou GI', 'Prentza A', 'Vlahopoulos S', 'Koutsouris D', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F', 'Chatziioannou AA']","['School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Digital Systems, University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.', 'School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'University Research Institute for Genetic and Malignant Diseases of Childhood, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Institute of Biological Research & Biotechnology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111220,England,J Clin Bioinforma,Journal of clinical bioinformatics,101554637,,,,2011/12/22 06:00,2011/12/22 06:01,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['2043-9113-1-36 [pii]', '10.1186/2043-9113-1-36 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Bioinforma. 2011 Dec 20;1:36. doi: 10.1186/2043-9113-1-36.,,PMC3313905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zfx is a shared transcriptional regulator of both embryonic stem cells (ESC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which suggests a common genetic basis of self-renewal in embryonic and adult stem cells. The level of Zfx expression correlates with aggressiveness and severity in many cancer types, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia. However, the importance of Zfx in human glioma is largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the role of Zfx in human glioma. METHODS: We detected expression levels of Zfx mRNA in U251 cells, U87 cells, U373 cells, and A172 cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. To analyze the expression of Zfx mRNA in glioma tissues, we performed real-time quantitative PCR on 35 pathologically confirmed glioma samples (Grade I-4cases, Grade II-13cases, Grade III-11cases, and Grade IV-7cases) and on 5 noncancerous brain tissue samples. We used lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down Zfx expression in the human malignant glioma cell line U251. Changes in Zfx target gene expression were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Cell proliferation was examined by a High Content Screening assay. DNA synthesis in proliferating cells was determined by BrdU incorporation. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flowcytometric analysis. RESULTS: We discovered that Zfx mRNA was expressed in U251 cells, U87 cells, U373 cells, and A172 cells. The expression level of Zfx is significantly higher in gliomas compared to noncancerous brain tissue. Using a lentivirus-based RNAi approach, Zfx expression was significantly inhibited in human glioblastoma U251 cells. The effects of Zfx knockdown on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were assessed.

Using Primer Explorer software, four sets of primers were designed and RT-LAMP assay reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP was performed at different times by four primer sets. Agarose gel analysis showed that WYMV could be detected after 30 min with the primer set III and after 45 min with the other three primer sets, both under the 80-min reaction time. RT-LAMP had the same results with the four primer sets, thus primer set III and 65 degrees C for 80 min reaction were selected for virus detection. There was no significant different when avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT-LAMP with the four primer sets and M-MLV was chosen due to its relatively cheap price. The result on specificity showed that the assay could amplify WYMV specifically, and the sensitivity comparison showed that the RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

In this work we describe novel aminoferrocene-based prodrugs, which, in contrast to hydroxyferrocifen, after activation form not only quinone methides (QMs), but also catalysts (iron or ferrocenium ions). The released products act in a concerted fashion. In particular, QMs alkylate glutathione, thereby inhibiting the antioxidative system of the cell, whereas the iron species induce catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals. Since the catalysts are formed as products of the activation reaction, it proceeds autocatalytically.

In this work, we determined the expression levels of TALE genes in leukemic-derived cell lines, in blood samples of patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in the blood samples of healthy donors. RESULTS: Here we show increased expression of MEIS1, MEIS2, and PREP1 genes in leukemia-derived cell lines compared with blood normal cells. High levels of MEIS1 and PREP1, and low levels of PBX4 expression were also founded in samples of patients with ALL. Importantly, silencing of MEIS1 decreases the proliferation of leukemia-derived cells but increases their survival after etoposide treatment. Etoposide-induced apoptosis induces down-regulation of MEIS1 expression or PREP1 up-regulation in chemotherapy-resistant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that up-regulation of MEIS1 is important for sustaining proliferation of leukemic cells and that down-regulation of MEIS1 or up-regulation of PREP1 and PBX genes could be implicated in the modulation of the cellular response to chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis.","['Rosales-Avina, Judith A', 'Torres-Flores, Jorge', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Gurrola-Diaz, Carmen', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo C', 'Lerma-Diaz, Jose M', 'de Celis, Ruth', 'Gonzalez-Ramella, Oscar', 'Barrera-Chaires, Esperanza', 'Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F']","['Rosales-Avina JA', 'Torres-Flores J', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Gurrola-Diaz C', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Lerma-Diaz JM', 'de Celis R', 'Gonzalez-Ramella O', 'Barrera-Chaires E', 'Bravo-Cuellar A', 'Jave-Suarez LF']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente - IMSS, Sierra Mojada No. 800, CP 44340, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PBX4 protein, human)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-112 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Dec 20;30:112. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-112.,,PMC3259065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that the PTEN gene is probably involved in human malignant disease pathogenesis, multidrug resistance, angiogenesis and extramedullary infiltration. This study was designed to investigate the effect of wild-type PTEN gene transfection on drug resistance reversal in K562/ADM leukemia cells in vitro and the possible mechanism. A recombinant adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein gene and wild-type PTEN gene (Ad-PTEN-GFP) or a recombined adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein gene only (Ad-GFP) was transfected into K562/ADM cells. These cells were then treated with different concentrations of adriamycin, cytarabine or arsenic trioxide, respectively. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of each drug was detected by MTT assay and the drug resistance reversal factor (RF) was calculated. The proliferation inhibition rate of these K562/ADM cells treated with or without the above-mentioned drugs was determined by MTT assay and the apoptosis rate was evaluated by flow cytometry. PTEN, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), I-kappaB, p53, multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and MRP, and apoptosis related genes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax mRNA levels were detected by real-time fluorescence relative-quantification reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR). PTEN, Akt, p-Akt and NF-kappaB (p65) protein levels were detected by Western blot. Results showed that PTEN gene transfection could increase the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. The drug resistance reversal index of adriamycin, cytarabine and arsenic trioxide was 3.8-fold, 2.65-fold and 2.64-fold, respectively, after PTEN gene transfection. NF-kappaB, MDR1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA levels as well as p-Akt and NF-kappaB (p65) protein levels were down-regulated, while p53 and Bax mRNA levels were up-regulated in K562/ADM cells after transfection with Ad-PTEN-GFP. Therefore, wild-type PTEN gene transfection might increase drug sensitivity or reverse drug resistance via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway and regulating downstream molecules of the cell signaling transduction pathway in K562/ADM cells, such as down-regulating NF-kappaB, MDR1, Bcl-2 expression but up-regulating the expression of p53 and Bax.","['Cheng, Zhiyong', 'Yang, Ning', 'Liang, Wentong', 'Yan, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Lin', 'Pan, Ling']","['Cheng Z', 'Yang N', 'Liang W', 'Yan X', 'Li L', 'Pan L']","['Department of Hematology, The First (No. 1) Hospital of Baoding, Baoding, P R China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120131,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.650695 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1383-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.650695.

Three flavonoids extracted from the rhizome of K. parviflora were 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF) and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), and synthetic flavonoids including 5-methoxyflavone (5-MF) and 2'-methoxyflavone (2""-MF) were chosen for testing in this study. The aims of this study were to examine whether the treatment of TRAIL-resistant leukemia MOLT-4 and U937 cells, with methoxyflavone derivatives could enhance the apoptotic response and to identify the mechanism involved. METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of methoxyflavone (MF) derivatives in MOLT-4, U937 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed by the MTT assay. The induction of apoptosis and the reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) after staining with annexin V FITC and propidium iodide (PI), and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC(6)), respectively, were performed using flow cytometry. ROS production was determined by staining with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and processed with a flow cytometer. DR4, DR5, cFLIP, Mcl-1, BAX and Bid expression were demonstrated by immunoblotting. Caspase-8 and -3 activities were determined by using IETD-AFC and DEVD-AFC substrates and the fluorescence intensity was measured. RESULTS: All methoxyflavone derivatives were cytotoxic to MOLT-4, U937 cells and PBMCs, except DMF, TMF and PMF were not toxic to PBMCs. All MF derivatives induced human leukemic MOLT-4 cell apoptosis, but not in U937 cells. Percentage of MOLT-4 cells with (DeltaPsim) was increased when treated with DMF, TMF, PMF, 5-MF and 2'-MF in the presence of TRAIL. 5-MF and 2'-MF enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the up-regulation of both DRs and the down-regulation of cFLIP and Mcl-1. Bid was cleaved and BAX was up-regulated, followed by the activation of caspase-8 and -3. Oxidative stress was also increased. 2'-MF gave the same result compared with 5-MF but with a less effect. CONCLUSION: Methoxyflavone derivatives enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human leukemic MOLT-4 cells through the death receptors and mitochondrial pathways.","['Wudtiwai, Benjawan', 'Sripanidkulchai, Bungorn', 'Kongtawelert, Prachya', 'Banjerdpongchai, Ratana']","['Wudtiwai B', 'Sripanidkulchai B', 'Kongtawelert P', 'Banjerdpongchai R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111221,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Flavones)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flavones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-52 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-52 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 Dec 21;4:52. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-52.,,PMC3281787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results revealed that curcumin significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of L-ASP in the three ALL cell lines compared to that for L-ASP alone ( p < 0.05). Curcumin and L-ASP co-treatments induced apoptosis, via activation and cleavage of caspase-8 and BID cleavage accompanied by release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9/3, compared to the group treated with only L-ASP and the control group. Furthermore, the combination of curcumin and L-ASP led to significant reductions in phosphorylated AKT and expression of AKT-regulated gene products (FoxO1, GSK3beta, IKKalpha, NF-kappaB, XIAP) compared with the group treated with only L-ASP and the control group. Overall, our fi ndings suggest that curcumin potentiates the antitumor effects of L-ASP in acute lymphoblastic leukemia by constitutively inhibiting AKT and AKT-regulated gene products.","['Wang, Hua', 'Geng, Qi-Rong', 'Wang, Liang', 'Lu, Yue']","['Wang H', 'Geng QR', 'Wang L', 'Lu Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, P R China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120125,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2011/12/22 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.649478 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1376-82. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.649478.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Depending on leukocyte count in the onset of AL, 70 patients with first ever diagnosed AL were divided into two groups: group 1 - 17 patients with leukocyte count > 30 x 10(9)/l, group 2 - 53 patients with leukocyte count < 30 x 10(9)/l. Serum and leukocyte parameters were studied before treatment, during the treatment with cytostatic drugs, in the course of myelotoxic agranulocytosis (MTA), after normalization of hemograms. EP was detected with enzyme immunoassay, serum and leukocyte ferritin - with radioimmunoassay; HIF-1alpha, Hp - sandwich enzyme immunoassay using monospecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies against relevant antigens. Leukocytes were isolated in ficol and verografin solutions density gradient. Chromatographic division of the protein fractions in 3 patients with leukocytosis in AL onset and leukocytes of 3 donors was made by the method of preparative isoelectrofocusing of BC and leukocytes on LKB colon (Sweden). Effects of these fractions were studied on 11 plasma samples from hematological patients and 4 plasma samples from patients with normal hemopoiesis. RESULTS: Leukocytosis patients with initial AL have serum ferritin, Hp and HIF-1alpha levels about 2-5 times lower than patients without leukocytosis. Cytostatic treatment raises an HIF-1alpha level in BC about 15-fold (85.8 +/- 24.5 pg/ml), in the study group - 3-fold (15.2 +/- 3.3 pg/ml). The highest EP levels were seen in MTA. It is detected that protein fractions isolated from leukocytes of patients with leukocytosis in the disease onset raise HIF-1alpha content irrespective of HIF-1alpha presence in the fraction. Patients free of hematological diseases have no changes of the above proteins. CONCLUSION: Great difficulties exist in ferritin and Hp levels between AL patients with leukocytosis in the onset of the disease and without of leukocytosis.

DESIGN: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988-2007), we compared a cohort of patients diagnosed as having CM as a first cancer with a cohort of patients diagnosed as having CM following a previous cancer. PARTICIPANTS: We included 70,819 patients with CM as a first primary cancer and 6353 patients with CM following a previous cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated the relative risk (RR) for development of primary CM following a previous cancer and used Cox modeling to examine survival characteristics of the 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Patients younger than 45 years at first cancer diagnosis had significantly higher risk of CM following cutaneous melanoma (RR, 11.89; 95% CI, 10.83-13.03), other nonepithelial skin cancer (RR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.13-5.79), Kaposi sarcoma (RR, 3.26; 95% CI 1.41-6.42), female breast cancer (RR, 1.38; (1.11-1.70), and lymphoma (RR, 1.79; (95% CI, 1.30-2.41). Patients 45 years or older at first cancer diagnosis had significantly higher risk of CM following cutaneous melanoma (RR, 8.36; 95% CI, 7.93-8.81), other nonepithelial skin cancer (RR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.35-2.86), ocular melanoma (RR, 5.34; 95% CI 3.42-7.94), female breast cancer (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21), prostate cancer (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13), thyroid cancer (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82), lymphoma (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55), and leukemia (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.49-2.13). Characteristics associated with better survival in both cohorts included female sex, age younger than 45 years at melanoma diagnosis, being married, being white vs black, decreasing Breslow depth, lack of tumor ulceration, no nodal involvement, and absence of metastases. CONCLUSION: Given that cutaneous melanoma is the most common second primary cancer in patients with a first CM (a risk that remains elevated for over 15 years), our results suggest the need for continued skin surveillance in melanoma survivors.","['Yang, Geoffrey B', 'Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill S', 'Chen, Yanwen', 'Bordeaux, Jeremy S']","['Yang GB', 'Barnholtz-Sloan JS', 'Chen Y', 'Bordeaux JS']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['147/12/1395 [pii]', '10.1001/archdermatol.2011.1133 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2011 Dec;147(12):1395-402. doi: 10.1001/archdermatol.2011.1133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used transient transfection analysis, oligonucleotide pulldown assays and chromatin immuno-precititation in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-inducible promyelocytic cell lines MPRO and NB4. We demonstrate that sumoylated wild-type p42-C/EBPalpha is associated with negative regulation of the myeloid specific lactoferrin (LF) gene in early myeloid cells and that a reduction in p42-C/EBPalpha sumoylation coincides with expression of the LF gene in maturing myeloid cells. In the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 however, sumoylated p42 remains persistently bound to the LF promoter following ATRA-induction. This correlates with lack of lactoferrin expression in these cells. Changes in sumoylation status of C/EBPalpha thus appear to contribute to a switch that regulates transcriptional activity of this master regulator during normal neutrophil development. We also demonstrate that sumoylation of the AML associated dominant negative p30-C/EBPalpha isoform does not alter transactivation activity of the LF promoter. This may be because the p30 C/EBPalpha isoform binds to the LF promoter much less efficiently than its full length counterpart. Our data suggest that the activity of p42-C/EBPalpha in the developing neutrophil is more sensitive to changes in sumoylation than the p30 isoform. This difference may contribute to the leukemogenic potential of p30-C/EBPalpha.","['Hankey, William', 'Silver, Matthew', 'Sun, B S Hong', 'Zibello, Terry', 'Berliner, Nancy', 'Khanna-Gupta, Arati']","['Hankey W', 'Silver M', 'Sun BS', 'Zibello T', 'Berliner N', 'Khanna-Gupta A']","['The Ohio State University, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology & Medical Genetics, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110520,Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,2011/12/21 06:00,2011/12/21 06:01,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4081/hr.2011.e5 [doi]', 'hr.2011.e5 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol Rep. 2011 Jan 13;3(1):e5. doi: 10.4081/hr.2011.e5.

We searched for a correlation between the BCR-ABL transcripts type and CML patients' characteristics, including MDR1 gene expression. Ninety-eight untreated chronic phase CML patients were studied. The type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts and MDR1 gene expression were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. B3a2 and b2a2 transcripts were found in 53 [54%] and 44 [45%] patients, respectively. One patient co-expressed b3a2/b2a2 and was excluded from analysis. The only difference in the clinical characteristics between the two groups was the platelets count, that was higher in b3a2((+)) patients [791.3+/-441.3x10(9)/L vs. 440.4+/-283.4x10(9)/L in b2a2((+)); P=0.007]. MDR1 over-expression [MDR1((+))] was observed in 48 patients (49.5%), more frequently in older patients >60 years [71% (24/34) vs. 38% (24/63) in younger; P=0.008], and was associated with a lower white blood cells (WBC) count [105.5+/-79.8x 10(9)/L vs. 143.6+/-96.5x10(9)/L in MDR1((-)) cases; P=0.047]. On performing the analysis only within the MDR1((+)) group, the b(3)a(2) ((+)) cases were characterized with a significantly higher platelets count [908.7+/-470.1x10(9)/L vs. 472.9+/-356.1x10(9)/L; P=0.006] and a lower WBC count [85.4+/-61.2x10(9)/L vs. 130+/-93.9x10(9)/L; P=0.004) compared to b2a2((+)) patients. No similar differences were found between b3a2((+)) and b2a2((+)) groups with normal MDR1 levels.

We investigated whether CML stem cells, in a transgenic mouse model of CML-like disease or derived from patients, are dependent on Bcr-Abl. In the transgenic model, after retransplantation, donor-derived CML stem cells in which Bcr-Abl expression had been induced and subsequently shut off were able to persist in vivo and reinitiate leukemia in secondary recipients on Bcr-Abl reexpression. Bcr-Abl knockdown in human CD34(+) CML cells cultured for 12 days in physiologic growth factors achieved partial inhibition of Bcr-Abl and downstream targets p-CrkL and p-STAT5, inhibition of proliferation and colony forming cells, but no reduction of input cells. The addition of dasatinib further inhibited p-CrkL and p-STAT5, yet only reduced input cells by 50%. Complete growth factor withdrawal plus dasatinib further reduced input cells to 10%; however, the surviving fraction was enriched for primitive leukemic cells capable of growth in a long-term culture-initiating cell assay and expansion on removal of dasatinib and addition of growth factors. Together, these data suggest that CML stem cell survival is Bcr-Abl kinase independent and suggest curative approaches in CML must focus on kinase-independent mechanisms of resistance.","['Hamilton, Ashley', 'Helgason, G Vignir', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Myssina, Svetlana', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Brunton, Valerie G', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Hamilton A', 'Helgason GV', 'Schemionek M', 'Zhang B', 'Myssina S', 'Allan EK', 'Nicolini FE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Bhatia R', 'Brunton VG', 'Koschmieder S', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46114-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-326843 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 9;119(6):1501-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-326843.

The novel BH3 mimetic navitoclax (ABT-263) specifically inhibits BCL2 and related proteins BCL-x(l) and BCL-w, potently inducing apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro. A phase I trial in patients with CLL was conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biologic activity of oral navitoclax. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with relapsed or refractory CLL received daily navitoclax for 14 days (10, 110, 200, or 250 mg/d; n = 15) or 21 days (125, 200, 250, or 300 mg/d; n = 14) of each 21-day cycle. Dose escalation decisions were informed by continual reassessment methodology. RESULTS: Lymphocytosis was reduced by more than 50% in 19 of 21 patients with baseline lymphocytosis. Among 26 patients treated with navitoclax >/= 110 mg/d, nine (35%) achieved a partial response and seven maintained stable disease for more than 6 months. Median treatment duration was 7 months (range, 1 to >/= 29 months). Median progression-free survival was 25 months. Activity was observed in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease, bulky adenopathy, and del(17p) CLL. Thrombocytopenia due to BCL-x(l) inhibition was the major dose-limiting toxicity and was dose-related. Low MCL1 expression and high BIM:MCL1 or BIM:BCL2 ratios in leukemic cells correlated with response. We determined that the navitoclax dose of 250 mg/d in a continuous dosing schedule was optimal for phase II studies. CONCLUSION: BCL2 is a valid therapeutic target in CLL, and its inhibition by navitoclax warrants further evaluation as monotherapy and in combination in this disease.","['Roberts, Andrew W', 'Seymour, John F', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Wierda, William G', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Khaw, Seong Lin', 'Carney, Dennis A', 'He, Simon Z', 'Huang, David C S', 'Xiong, Hao', 'Cui, Yue', 'Busman, Todd A', 'McKeegan, Evelyn M', 'Krivoshik, Andrew P', 'Enschede, Sari H', 'Humerickhouse, Rod']","['Roberts AW', 'Seymour JF', 'Brown JR', 'Wierda WG', 'Kipps TJ', 'Khaw SL', 'Carney DA', 'He SZ', 'Huang DC', 'Xiong H', 'Cui Y', 'Busman TA', 'McKeegan EM', 'Krivoshik AP', 'Enschede SH', 'Humerickhouse R']","['MBBS, Department of Clinical Haematology and BMT, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, 2 Centre, Grattan St, Parkville 3050, Victoria, Australia. roberts@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.7898 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7898 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Feb 10;30(5):488-96. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7898.

The prevalence of insulin resistance and other cardiometabolic risk factors is increased in ALL survivors, and insufficient physical activity (PA) and low cardiopulmonary fitness are common. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a simple, inexpensive home-based exercise program on cardiometabolic risk factors and fitness in long-term ALL survivors. PROCEDURE: Seventeen 16- to 30-year-old survivors of childhood ALL (age at diagnosis </=16 years) were recruited to a 16-week home-based exercise program. Peak oxygen uptake (VO(2 peak)), muscle strength, and metabolic risk factors were studied before and after the exercise program. RESULTS: Fasting plasma insulin (P = 0.01), HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment, insulin resistance) (P = 0.002), waist circumference (P = 0.003), waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.002), fat percent (P = 0.04), and supine diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.03) decreased during the program, while weight and body mass index remained unchanged. VO(2 peak) and maximal work load (W/kg) improved by 5% (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively) during the exercise program. The results of the Sit-Up test, Back extensor test, and Full Squatting test improved as well (P = 0.01, P = 0.002, and P = 0.0004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A simple home-based exercise program was effective in improving cardiometabolic risk factor status and fitness in young adult survivors of childhood ALL. Simple exercise programs should be recommended to this population with increased risk of CVD to improve metabolic risk factor status and fitness.","['Jarvela, Liisa S', 'Kemppainen, Jukka', 'Niinikoski, Harri', 'Hannukainen, Jarna C', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Kapanen, Jukka', 'Arola, Mikko', 'Heinonen, Olli J']","['Jarvela LS', 'Kemppainen J', 'Niinikoski H', 'Hannukainen JC', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Kapanen J', 'Arola M', 'Heinonen OJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. liisa.jarvela@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Insulin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', '*Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/etiology/prevention & control', '*Exercise', 'Fasting/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*blood', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', '*Muscle Strength', 'Oxygen/blood', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24049 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):155-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24049.

It has been demonstrated that a flavonoid named xanthomicrol from D. kotschyi contributes to its preferential antiproliferative activity against malignant cells. In the present study, the antiproliferative activity of its flavonoid fraction was further characterized. Using liquid-liquid extraction and a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC method, eight flavonoid aglycones were isolated from the aerial parts of the plant and their identities were confirmed through MS and NMR analyses as luteolin, naringenin, apigenin, isokaempferide, cirsimaritin, penduletin, xanthomicrol and calycopterin. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of each compound was evaluated against a panel of established normal and malignant cell lines using the MTT assay and some structure-activity relationships were observed. The hydroxyflavones (luteolin, apigenin and isokaempferide) exerted comparable antiproliferative activities against malignant and normal cells, while the methoxylated hydroxyflavones (cirsimaritin, penduletin, xanthomicrol and calycopterin) showed preferential activities against tumor cells. This activity may be of value in treating tumors as it would exert few side effects in normal tissues. Xanthomicrol selectively inhibited the growth of human gastric adenocarcinoma, while calycopterin selectively prevented human acute promyelocytic leukemia and human colon carcinoma cells proliferation.","['Moghaddam, Ghazaal', 'Ebrahimi, Soltan Ahmad', 'Rahbar-Roshandel, Nahid', 'Foroumadi, Alireza']","['Moghaddam G', 'Ebrahimi SA', 'Rahbar-Roshandel N', 'Foroumadi A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '3IN82Y8CAA (xanthomicrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Flavones/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lamiaceae/chemistry', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/10/27 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.3678 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2012 Jul;26(7):1023-8. doi: 10.1002/ptr.3678.

However, the mechanism by which they perform this task has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that Myc directly upregulates the transcription of all core components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) as well as the ESC-specific PRC2-associated factors. By expressing Myc protein fused with the estrogen receptor (Myc-ER) in fibroblasts, we observed that Myc, binding to the regulatory elements of Suz12, Ezh2, and Eed, induces the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and the recruitment of elongating RNA polymerase II at their promoters. The silencing of both c-Myc and N-Myc in ESC results in reduced expression of PRC2 and H3K27me3 at Polycomb target developmental regulators and upregulation of genes involved in primitive endoderm differentiation. The ectopic expression of PRC2 in ESC, either silenced for c-Myc and N-Myc or induced to differentiate by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal, is sufficient to maintain the H3K27me3 mark at genes with bivalent histone modifications and keep repressed the genes involved in ESC differentiation. Thus, Myc proteins control the expression of developmental regulators via the upregulation of the Polycomb PRC2 complex.","['Neri, Francesco', 'Zippo, Alessio', 'Krepelova, Anna', 'Cherubini, Alessandro', 'Rocchigiani, Marina', 'Oliviero, Salvatore']","['Neri F', 'Zippo A', 'Krepelova A', 'Cherubini A', 'Rocchigiani M', 'Oliviero S']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'E-Box Elements', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.06148-11 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.06148-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2012 Feb;32(4):840-51. doi: 10.1128/MCB.06148-11.

This condition is supposed to select hypoxia-resistant cells of scientific and clinical interest. Ionic channels are ultimately the expression of the functional maturation of neurons, so the aim of this research was to characterize the pattern of the main voltage-dependent ionic channels in T6-NPCs differentiating to a neuronal phenotype, comparing it with NPCs isolated soon after death (T0-NPCs). T6- and T0-NPCs grow in medium containing epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Differentiation was performed in small wells without the addition of growth factors, in the presence of adhesion molecules, fetal bovine serum, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Ionic currents, recorded by means of whole-cell patch-clamp, namely, I(Ca2+) HVA, both L- and non-L-type, I(K+) delayed rectifying, I(K+) inward rectifier, transient I(K+A) , and TTX-sensitive I(Na+) have been found, although Na(+) currents were found in only a small percentage of cells and after the fifth week of differentiation. No significant differences in current types, density, orcell capacitance were observed between T6-NPCs and T0-NPCs. The sequence in which the markers appear in new neural cells is not necessarily a fixed program, but the discrepancies in morphological, biochemical, and electrophysiological maturation of mouse NPCs to neurons, possibly different in vivo, suggest that the various steps of the differentiation are independently regulated. Therefore, in addition to morphological and biochemical data, functional tests should be considered for characterizing the maturation of neurons.","['Bellardita, Carmelo', 'Bolzoni, Francesco', 'Sorosina, Melissa', 'Marfia, Giovanni', 'Carelli, Stephana', 'Gorio, Alfredo', 'Formenti, Alessandro']","['Bellardita C', 'Bolzoni F', 'Sorosina M', 'Marfia G', 'Carelli S', 'Gorio A', 'Formenti A']","['Dipartimento Fisiologia Umana, Universita di Milano, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111220,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Sodium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '66-40-0 (Tetraethylammonium)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Biophysics', 'Brain/*cytology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', '*Postmortem Changes', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels', 'Sodium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Sodium Channels', 'Tetraethylammonium/pharmacology', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22805 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2012 Apr;90(4):751-8. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22805.

However, the role of Akt in the pathogenesis of pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-pre ALL) remains to be clarified. This study was undertaken to explore the clinical relevance and molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Akt (i.e., phosphorylated Akt, P-Akt) in pediatric B-pre ALL. PROCEDURE: We evaluated the activation status of Akt in bone marrow samples from 21 children with newly diagnosed B-pre ALL and correlated the expression level of P-Akt with clinicopathologic and prognostic features. Additionally, we transfected the myristoylated Akt cDNA into the B-pre ALL cell line, Nalm-6, and examined the effect, in vitro, of Akt activation on the response to antitumor drugs. RESULTS: P-Akt expression in B-pre ALL blast cells at diagnosis was associated significantly with poor response to induction chemotherapy including prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, and adriamycin in B-pre ALL patients. Both overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients with P-Akt expression were reduced significantly more than in patients without P-Akt expression. Activation of Akt reduced the extent of apoptosis induced by the antitumor drugs in Nalm-6 listed above. Activation of Akt did not induce expression of P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter that is capable of conferring multidrug resistance. CONCLUSION: These results support the contention that Akt activation is a mechanism of chemotherapeutic resistance in B-pre ALL and suggest that Akt can be a therapeutic target for the treatment of relapsed or refractory pediatric B-pre ALL.","['Morishita, Naoto', 'Tsukahara, Hirokazu', 'Chayama, Kosuke', 'Ishida, Toshiaki', 'Washio, Kana', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Yamashita, Nobuko', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Morishima, Tsuneo']","['Morishita N', 'Tsukahara H', 'Chayama K', 'Ishida T', 'Washio K', 'Miyamura T', 'Yamashita N', 'Oda M', 'Morishima T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111219,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Blast Crisis/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24034 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):83-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24034.

If forced into the nucleus Bcr-Abl causes apoptosis. To achieve nuclear translocation, binding domains for capture of Bcr-Abl were generated and attached to proteins with signals destined for the nucleus. These resulting proteins would be capable of binding and translocating endogenous Bcr-Abl to the nucleus. METHODS: Bcr-Abl was targeted at 3 distinct domains for capture: by construction of high affinity intracellular antibody domains (iDabs) to regions of Bcr-Abl known to promote cytoplasmic retention, via its coiled coil domain (CC), and through a naturally occurring protein-protein interaction domain (RIN1). These binding domains were then tested for their ability to escort Bcr-Abl into the nucleus using a ""protein switch"" or attachment of 4 nuclear localization signals (NLSs). RESULTS: Although RIN1, ABI7-iDab, and CCmut3 constructs all produced similar colocalization with Bcr-Abl, only 4NLS-CCmut3 produced efficient nuclear translocation of Bcr-Abl. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a small binding domain can be used to control the subcellular localization of Bcr-Abl, which may have implications for CML therapy. Our ultimate future goal is to change the location of critical proteins to alter their function.","['Dixon, Andrew S', 'Constance, Jonathan E', 'Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Lim, Carol S']","['Dixon AS', 'Constance JE', 'Tanaka T', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Lim CS']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, 421 Wakara Way, Rm. 318, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11095-011-0654-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2012 Apr;29(4):1098-109. doi: 10.1007/s11095-011-0654-8.

Recently, there has been a rapid expansion of the epidemiological literature both of studies evaluating self-reported allergy history in relation to cancer risk and of studies evaluating biological indicators of allergy history and immune function including levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) E. However, there are several potential methodological limitations associated with prior studies, and further research is required to clarify associations observed. This paper summarizes the recent epidemiological literature examining associations between allergy history and cancer risk. From 2008, a total of 55 epidemiological studies were identified that examined some aspect of the association between allergy and cancer. Although the majority of studies examined self-reported allergy history in relation to cancer risk, there were also studies examining allergy diagnoses or discharges as captured in existing administrative databases, levels of IgE, polymorphisms of allergy, inflammatory- or allergy-related cytokine genes, and concentrations of immune regulatory proteins. The most frequently studied cancer sites included brain and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers. Potential methodological sources of bias are discussed as well as recommendations for future work.","['Turner, Michelle C']",['Turner MC'],"['McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, Institute of Population Health, University of Ottawa, One Stewart Street, Room 313, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada. mturner@uottawa.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111220,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",2011/12/21 06:00,2013/01/24 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1180-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Sep;61(9):1493-510. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1180-6.

Eighty-three samples taken at different time points from 38 CML patients; were subjected to T315I mutation analysis and gene expression analysis of AHI1; a novel gene that is thought to have a role in both BCR-ABL1 mediated leukemic transformation and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Only one patient (2.63%) harboured the T315I mutation. While no significant difference in AHI1 expression was observed between newly diagnosed CML samples and non-CML controls; CML samples under imatinib therapy had levels significantly higher than both newly diagnosed samples and controls. In the first 6 months of imatinib therapy, AHI1 expression was found to increase and then gradually decrease. There was no significant difference between imatinib responders and non-responders, while dasatinib caused significantly lower AHI1 levels. It is proposed that the change in AHI1 expression during CML therapy might be under the control of mechanisms independent from BCR-ABL1. AHI1 mediated signalling could be better understood by analyzing AHI1 gene expression levels in a greater number of patients and concurrently investigating JAK/STAT and Src family kinases pathways.","['Balci, Tugce Bulakbasi', 'Sahin, Feride Iffet', 'Karakus, Sema', 'Ozdogu, Hakan']","['Balci TB', 'Sahin FI', 'Karakus S', 'Ozdogu H']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (AHI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453311X13127324303272 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2011 Nov;16(6):357-60. doi: 10.1179/102453311X13127324303272.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports have suggested that Lif mRNA is up-regulated in the limb and diaphragm muscles of mdx mice, in human cases of dystrophy and acutely following exercise. This study examined expression of Lif mRNA in the quadriceps muscles of mdx and wild-type mice that were either sedentary or allowed to exercise voluntarily for two weeks. RESULTS: Exercise caused a decrease in Lif mRNA expression in wild-type muscle, but this was not the case in mdx muscle. Lif mRNA levels in sedentary mdx mice were similar to those in exercised wild type muscles, and in mdx mice there was no further decrease in levels following exercise. Similar down-regulation of Lif mRNA was observed in the tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles of mdx mice at three and six weeks of age respectively, compared with wild-type controls. Transcripts for the LIF receptor (Lifr) were also down-regulated in these mdx muscles, suggesting LIF activity may be minimised in dystrophic muscle. However fluorescent immunohistochemical labeling of LIF did not correlate with transcript expression data, as LIF immunoreactivity could not be detected in wild-type muscle, where mRNA expression was high, but was present in dystrophic muscle where mRNA expression was low. This study also described the translocation of membrane proteins, including LIFR, to the nuclei of syncytial muscle cells during differentiation and fusion. In addition this study demonstrates that survival of donor myoblasts injected into dystrophic muscle was enhanced by co-administration of recombinant LIF. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence to support a role for LIF in normal muscle biology in response to exercise. Although expression levels of Lif transcript in mdx muscles were not consistent with previous studies, the detection of LIF protein in mdx muscle but not wild-type muscle supports a role for LIF in dystrophy. This study also provides evidence of the differential localisation of the LIFR, and the potential for anti-inflammatory actions of LIF that promote survival of transplanted myoblasts in dystrophic muscle.*corresponding author: Jason White, Muscular Dystrophy Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute; email: jasondw@unimelb.edu.au.","['Hunt, Liam C', 'Anthea Coles, Chantal', 'Gorman, Christopher M', 'Tudor, Elizabeth M', 'Smythe, Gayle M', 'White, Jason D']","['Hunt LC', 'Anthea Coles C', 'Gorman CM', 'Tudor EM', 'Smythe GM', 'White JD']","['Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne; Murdoch Childrens Research Insitute; School of Community Health and Centre for Inland Health, Charles Sturt University and Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and School of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111122,United States,PLoS Curr,PLoS currents,101515638,,,,2011/12/21 06:00,2011/12/21 06:01,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/currents.RRN1277 [doi]', 'k/-/-/g7m7obkpy2dc/1 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Curr. 2011 Nov 22;3:RRN1277. doi: 10.1371/currents.RRN1277.,,PMC3222879,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deaths due to undiagnosed hematologic malignancies are limited to a small number of case reports. The following case of acute leukemia was diagnosed at forensic autopsy in a 5-year-old boy with no significant past medical history. He complained of nausea and vomiting 2 days before his death, with the subsequent development of fever. Meningitis was the initial suspected cause of death. Findings at autopsy included a 100% cellular bone marrow with greater than 95% blasts. Hemorrhages involving the cerebrum, pons, epicardium, lungs, and thymus were present. Prominent leukemic infiltrates and leukostasis were present in the brain, heart, lungs, spleen, hilar lymph nodes, liver, and kidneys. A peripheral blood smear and automated blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 435 x 10/L with greater than 80% circulating blasts. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the diagnosis of T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Given these circumstances, the diagnosis of acute leukemia should be considered when an intracerebral hemorrhage and/or visceral hemorrhages are identified on internal examination for appropriate collection of tissue for smears and microscopic examination. This case also highlights the uncommon, although serious, risks associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hyperleukocytosis.","['Stoecker, Maggie M', 'Wang, Endi', 'Simmons, Samuel']","['Stoecker MM', 'Wang E', 'Simmons S']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. maggie.stoecker@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Forensic Med Pathol,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,8108948,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Death, Sudden/*etiology', 'Forensic Pathology', 'Hemorrhage/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Pericardium/pathology', 'Pons/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Thymus Gland/pathology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAF.0b013e31823d7d27 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Forensic Med Pathol. 2012 Dec;33(4):314-6. doi: 10.1097/PAF.0b013e31823d7d27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that a small, residual pool of leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells can survive in the marrow microenvironment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients after years of kinase inhibitor treatment. Bone marrow (BM) stroma has been implicated in the long-term survival of leukemic cells, and contributes to the expansion and proliferation of both transformed and normal hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, we found that CML cells expressed CXCR4, and that plerixafor diminished BCR-ABL-positive cell migration and reduced adhesion of these cells to extra cellular-matrix components and to BM stromal cells in vitro. Moreover, plerixafor decreased the drug resistance of CML cells induced by co-culture with BM stromal cells in vitro. Using a functional mouse model of progressive and residual disease, we demonstrated the ability of the CXCR4 inhibitor, plerixafor, to mobilize leukemic cells in vivo, such that a plerixafor-nilotinib combination reduced the leukemia burden in mice significantly below the baseline level suppression exhibited by a moderate-to-high dose of nilotinib as single agent. These results support the idea of using CXCR4 inhibition in conjunction with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition to override drug resistance in CML and suppress or eradicate residual disease.","['Weisberg, E', 'Azab, A K', 'Manley, P W', 'Kung, A L', 'Christie, A L', 'Bronson, R', 'Ghobrial, I M', 'Griffin, J D']","['Weisberg E', 'Azab AK', 'Manley PW', 'Kung AL', 'Christie AL', 'Bronson R', 'Ghobrial IM', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011360 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.360 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):985-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.360.

Fragmentary data suggests Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitors enhance differentiation, and thus have potential therapeutic value. The present study shows that SFK inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib enhance aspects of MAPK signaling and regulate a panel of differentiation markers, including CD11b and p47(phox). HL-60 and NB4 myeloid leukemia cells show accelerated ATRA-induced G1/0 arrest/differentiation with inhibitor co-treatment. We also identified components of a Lyn- and c-Raf-containing MAPK signaling complex augmented by the inhibitors. PP2 and dasatinib increased the ATRA-induced expression of Lyn and c-Raf (total and c-RafpS259) and their interaction. The Lyn-associated serine/threonine kinase, casein kinase II (CK2), also complexed with c-Raf and c-RafpS259, and the kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) scaffold protein bound c-Raf, Lyn and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). c-Raf/ERK association was increased by the inhibitors, which is significant as ERK may cause c-Raf C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation in a putative feedback mechanism.

It is striking that, for a variety of these cells, the currently observed final outcomes of cellular therapies are often similar. This fact and the lack of convincing documentation for donor-recipient chimerism in treated tissues in most of the studies indicates that a mechanism other than transdifferentiation of cells infused systemically into peripheral blood or injected directly into damaged organs may have an important role. In this review, we will discuss the role of (i) growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive lipids and (ii) microvesicles (MVs) released from cells employed as cellular therapeutics in regenerative medicine. In particular, stem cells are a rich source of these soluble factors and MVs released from their surface may deliver RNA and microRNA into damaged organs. Based on these phenomena, we suggest that paracrine effects make major contributions in most of the currently reported positive results in clinical trials employing adult stem cells. We will also present possibilities for how these paracrine mechanisms could be exploited in regenerative medicine to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. This approach may yield critical improvements in current cell therapies before true pluripotent stem cells isolated in sufficient quantities from adult tissues and successfully expanded ex vivo will be employed in the clinic.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Kucia, M', 'Jadczyk, T', 'Greco, N J', 'Wojakowski, W', 'Tendera, M', 'Ratajczak, J']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Kucia M', 'Jadczyk T', 'Greco NJ', 'Wojakowski W', 'Tendera M', 'Ratajczak J']","['Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111219,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*therapeutic use', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Regenerative Medicine', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011389 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.389 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1166-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.389.

We previously reported that an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM32, interacts with several important proteins including RARalpha and enhances transcriptional activity of RARalpha in mouse neuroblastoma cells and embryonal carcinoma cells. Retinoic acid (RA), which acts as a ligand to nuclear receptors including RARalpha, plays crucial roles in development, differentiation, cell cycles and apoptosis. In this study, we found that TRIM32 enhances RARalpha-mediated transcriptional activity even in the absence of RA and stabilizes RARalpha in the human promyelogenous leukemic cell line HL60. Moreover, we found that overexpression of TRIM32 in HL60 cells suppresses cellular proliferation and induces granulocytic differentiation even in the absence of RA. These findings suggest that TRIM32 functions as one of the coactivators for RARalpha-mediated transcription in acute promyelogenous leukemia (APL) cells, and thus TRIM32 may become a potentially therapeutic target for APL.","['Sato, Tomonobu', 'Okumura, Fumihiko', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Ariga, Tadashi', 'Hatakeyama, Shigetsugu']","['Sato T', 'Okumura F', 'Iguchi A', 'Ariga T', 'Hatakeyama S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111211,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM32 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2011/12/21 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/12/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)02214-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jan 6;417(1):594-600. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.012.

A dose-dependent increase in apoptosis was observed in HL-60 cells cultured in ICM obtained after different doses of irradiation (0.5-10 cGy), which showed saturation in ICM from 5 cGy. Furthermore, ICM-L and ICM-H induced differential apoptotic responses in unirradiated HL-60 cells and lymphocytes. Apoptosis in lymphocytes cultured in ICM-H was significantly higher than when cells were cultured in unirradiated conditioned medium or ICM-L. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis in bystander HL-60 cells and lymphocytes cultured in ICM-L/ICM-H seems to be associated with an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential.

At the molecular level, Sle1a.1 corresponds to an increased expression of a novel splice isoform of Pbx1, Pbx1-d. Pbx1-d overexpression is sufficient to induce an activated/inflammatory phenotype in Jurkat T cells and to decrease their apoptotic response to retinoic acid.

However, the diagnostic usefulness and potential prognostic importance of CD200 expression have not been rigorously examined. We show that CD200 is uniformly expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and absent in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It is important to note that expression of CD200 is retained even in CLLs with immunophenotypic aberrancies, making CD200 a particularly useful marker for discrimination between these cases and MCL. CD200 is expressed in nearly all precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemias, with aberrant overexpression or underexpression compared with normal B-cell progenitors in 55% of cases.

Many cases can be diagnosed readily by flow cytometry (FCM) alone; however, ambiguous cases are frequently encountered and necessitate additional studies, including immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 and fluorescence in situ hybridization for IgH-CCND1 rearrangement. To determine if greater diagnostic accuracy could be achieved from FCM data alone, we developed an unbiased, machine-based algorithm to identify features that best distinguish between the 2 diseases. By applying conventional diagnostic criteria to the flow cytometry data, we were able to assign 28 of 44 (64%) MCL and 48 of 70 (69%) SLL cases correctly. In contrast, we were able to assign all 44 (100%) MCL and 68 of 70 (97%) SLL cases correctly using a novel set of criteria, as identified by our automated approach. The most discriminating feature was the CD20/CD23 mean fluorescence intensity ratio, and we found unexpectedly that inclusion of FMC7 expression in the diagnostic algorithm actually reduced its accuracy. This study demonstrates that computational methods can be used on existing clinical FCM data to improve diagnostic accuracy and suggests similar computational approaches could be used to identify novel prognostic markers and perhaps subdivide existing or define new diagnostic entities.","['Zare, Habil', 'Bashashati, Ali', 'Kridel, Robert', 'Aghaeepour, Nima', 'Haffari, Gholamreza', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Gupta, Arvind', 'Brinkman, Ryan R', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Zare H', 'Bashashati A', 'Kridel R', 'Aghaeepour N', 'Haffari G', 'Connors JM', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Gupta A', 'Brinkman RR', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['137/1/75 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPMMLQ67YOMGEW [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2012 Jan;137(1):75-85. doi: 10.1309/AJCPMMLQ67YOMGEW.,"['R01 EB005034/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB008400/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'EB008400/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', '94132/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",PMC4090220,,['NIHMS595110'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCI-32765, a selective, irreversible Btk inhibitor, is a novel, molecularly targeted agent for patients with B-cell malignancies, and is particularly active in patients with CLL. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of action of PCI-32765 in CLL, using in vitro and in vivo models, and performed correlative studies on specimens from patients receiving therapy with PCI-32765. PCI-32765 significantly inhibited CLL cell survival, DNA synthesis, and migration in response to tissue homing chemokines (CXCL12, CXCL13). PCI-32765 also down-regulated secretion of BCR-dependent chemokines (CCL3, CCL4) by the CLL cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In an adoptive transfer TCL1 mouse model of CLL, PCI-32765 affected disease progression. In this model, PCI-32765 caused a transient early lymphocytosis, and profoundly inhibited CLL progression, as assessed by weight, development, and extent of hepatospenomegaly, and survival. Our data demonstrate that PCI-32765 effectively inhibits CLL cell migration and survival, possibly explaining some of the characteristic clinical activity of this new targeted agent.","['Ponader, Sabine', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Buggy, Joseph J', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Ponader S', 'Chen SS', 'Buggy JJ', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Gandhi V', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Chiorazzi N', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Treatment options for these patients are more limited. BL22 is a recombinant protein composed of the variable region of a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD22 and of PE38, a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. BL22 is a very potent drug already used in patients with hairy cell leukemia, whereas in chronic lymphocytic leukemia its cytotoxicity is limited by a lower expression of CD22. Here we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by pre-activation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with bryostatin 1. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma patients were used in vitro to assess the therapeutic impact of drug combinations using BL22 and bryostatin 1. RESULTS: We demonstrate that bryostatin 1 sensitizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells for the cytotoxic effects of BL22 through activation of protein kinase C and subsequently increased CD22 surface expression. Dose and time response analysis reveals that activation of protein kinase C further activates an autocrine feedback loop degrading protein kinase C-betaII protein. Depletion of protein kinase C-betaII and upregulation of CD22 persist for several days following pre-stimulation with bryostatin 1. Therefore, our data provide a rationale for the sequential administration of BL22 following bryostatin 1 treatment. In addition to primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, bryostatin 1 also sensitizes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma cells to BL22 induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the combination of bryostatin 1 with antibodies directed against CD22 is a potent drug combination for the treatment of low- and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.","['Biberacher, Viola', 'Decker, Thomas', 'Oelsner, Madlen', 'Wagner, Michaela', 'Bogner, Christian', 'Schmidt, Burkhard', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Meyer Zum Buschenfelde, Christian', 'Ringshausen, Ingo']","['Biberacher V', 'Decker T', 'Oelsner M', 'Wagner M', 'Bogner C', 'Schmidt B', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Peschel C', 'Pastan I', 'Meyer Zum Buschenfelde C', 'Ringshausen I']","['Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Technical University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bryostatins/*pharmacology', 'Enterotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.049155 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.049155 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 May;97(5):771-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.049155.

These findings confirm that monosomal karyotype has a significantly adverse effect on post-remission outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with and without allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in first complete remission, emphasizing the need for the development of alternative therapies for this patient population.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Yamashita, Takuya', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Ago, Hiroatsu', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Waki, Fusako', 'Yokoyama, Hiroki', 'Watanabe, Masato', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Yanada M', 'Kurosawa S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Yamashita T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Ago H', 'Takeuchi J', 'Nakamae H', 'Taguchi J', 'Sakura T', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Waki F', 'Yokoyama H', 'Watanabe M', 'Emi N', 'Fukuda T']","['1Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/20 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.058289 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.058289 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):915-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.058289.

We have recently shown that all-trans-retinoic acid is capable of inducing hCNT3 trafficking to plasma membrane in the MEC1 cell line. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid on hCNT3 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells as a suitable mechanism to improve fludarabine-based therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cells from 23 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients wild-type for P53 were analyzed for ex vivo sensitivity to fludarabine. hCNT3 activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell samples was evaluated by measuring the uptake of [8-(3)H]-fludarabine. The amounts of transforming growth factor-beta1 and hCNT3 messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effect of all-trans-retinoic acid on hCNT3 subcellular localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy and its effect on fludarabine-induced apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis using annexin V staining. RESULTS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases showing higher ex vivo basal sensitivity to fludarabine also had a greater basal hCNT3-associated fludarabine uptake capacity compared to the subset of patients showing ex vivo resistance to the drug. hCNT3 transporter activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from the latter patients was either negligible or absent. Treatment of the fludarabine-resistant subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with all-trans-retinoic acid induced increased fludarabine transport via hCNT3 which was associated with a significant increase in fludarabine sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of ex vivo fludarabine sensitivity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is associated with increased hCNT3 activity after all-trans-retinoic acid treatment.","['Fernandez-Calotti, Paula X', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Pastor-Anglada, Marcal']","['Fernandez-Calotti PX', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Colomer D', 'Pastor-Anglada M']","['Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular, Universitat de Barcelona, IBUB & CIBER EHD Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Spain. pfernandezcalotti@ub.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*agonists/biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2011/12/20 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.051557 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.051557 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):943-51. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.051557.

The risk of developing therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia also applies to patients with non-malignant conditions, such as autoimmune diseases treated with cytotoxic and/or immunosuppressive agents. There is considerable evidence to suggest that there is an increased occurrence of hematologic malignancies in patients with autoimmune diseases compared to the general population, with a further increase in risk after exposure to cytotoxic therapies. Unfortunately, studies have failed to reveal a clear correlation between leukemia development and exposure to individual agents used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Given the dismal outcome of secondary acute myeloid leukemia and the wide range of available agents for treatment of autoimmune diseases, an increased awareness of this risk and further investigation into the pathogenetic mechanisms of acute leukemia in autoimmune disease patients are warranted. This article will review the data available on the development of acute myeloid leukemia in patients with autoimmune diseases. Possible leukemogeneic mechanisms in these patients, as well as evidence supporting the association of their primary immunosuppressive status and their exposure to specific therapies, will also be reviewed. This review also supports the idea that it may be misleading to label leukemias that develop in patients with autoimmune diseases who are exposed to cytotoxic agents as 'therapy-related leukemias'. A better understanding of the molecular defects in autoimmune disease patients who develop acute leukemia will lead to a better understanding of the association between these two diseases entities.","['Ramadan, Safaa M', 'Fouad, Tamer M', 'Summa, Valentina', 'Hasan, Syed Kh', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Ramadan SM', 'Fouad TM', 'Summa V', 'Hasan SKh', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Medical Oncology, NCI-Cairo University, 11796 Cairo, Egypt. safaanci@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Cytotoxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Multiple Sclerosis/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Risk']",2011/12/20 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.056283 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.056283 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):805-17. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.056283.

METHODS: All cases of adult ALL with a history of prior cytotoxic or radiation therapy at a leukemia referral center over a 13-year period were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three cases, representing 6.9% of all ALL cases, were identified. Of these, 17 (74%) had at least 1 high-risk feature; 8 (35%) had MLL rearrangements, and 4 were BCR-ABL(+) . MLL rearrangements were correlated with CD15 expression and absence of CD10, and also tended to have a shorter mean latency period and more prior topoisomerase II exposure. Twenty-one patients received induction therapy, and 18 (86%) achieved a complete response, 17 with 1 induction. Six patients have relapsed and died, and 4 others died of other complications, 2 of these postallogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 27 and 13.6 months, respectively, and 3-year DFS and OS were 37.1% and 37.6%, respectively.

Peripheral androgen blockade using a combination of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and an antiandrogen may allow control of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Because testosterone levels are not suppressed, this approach may be associated with less morbidity than conventional gonadal androgen suppression. METHODS: All patients had undergone previous definitive local therapy and had evidence of a rising PSA >1ng/mL, with no evidence of recurrent disease. Patients received both finasteride, 5 mg orally per day, and flutamide, 250 mg orally 3x a day. Patients were followed for a PSA response and quality of life assessment. RESULTS: Ninety-nine of 101 accrued patients were eligible. A >/=80% PSA decline was seen in 96 (96%) patients. The median time to PSA progression was 85 months. With a median follow-up of 10 years, the median survival time had not been reached, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 87%. Toxicity was mild, with 18 patients stopping for toxicity; 15 had diarrhea, 4 had gynecomastia, and 3 had transaminase elevation. Baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Module and Treatment Outcome Index scores decreased by 5 points each at 6 months after enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the finasteride/flutamide combination is feasible, and results in PSA declines of >/=80% in 96% of patients with serologic progression after definitive local therapy. There were no unexpected toxicities, and the change in quality of life was mild. Further evaluation of this or a similar regimen in a controlled clinical trial is warranted.","['Monk, J Paul', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Picus, Joel', 'Hussain, Arif', 'Philips, George', 'Kaplan, Ellen', 'Ahles, Tim', 'Gu, Lin', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas', 'Kelly, William K', 'Small, Eric J']","['Monk JP', 'Halabi S', 'Picus J', 'Hussain A', 'Philips G', 'Kaplan E', 'Ahles T', 'Gu L', 'Vogelzang N', 'Kelly WK', 'Small EJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA.

The ABD was reported to predict early treatment failure in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to investigate its prognostic value in Taiwanese patients with T-cell ALL. PROCEDURE: Forty-five children with T-cell ALL were enrolled from six medical centers in Taiwan. Quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was performed to check the status of TCRgamma deletion. The threshold for homozygous deletions by Q-PCR was defined as a fold-change <0.35. RESULTS: ABD was found in 20 patients [20:45] who had higher incidences of induction failure than those without ABD (P = 0.03; hazard ratio [HR] = 8.13; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.23-53.77) after multivariate regression analysis. Patents with ABD also had inferior EFS and OS (P = 0.071 and 0.0196, respectively). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the association between ABD and overall survival was independent of age and leukocyte count on presentation (P = 0.036; HR = 4.25; 95% CI = 1.10-16.42). CONCLUSIONS: The absence of TCRgamma deletion is a predictor of a poor response to induction chemotherapy for pediatric patients with T-cell ALL in Taiwan.

These cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis can escape into the blood and infiltrate lung and CNS. The most common cause of death is bone marrow failure. It is likely that many different mutations and/or epigenetic aberrations can produce the same disease, with these differences responsible for the very variable response to therapy, which is AML's principal clinical feature. DIAGNOSIS: This rests on demonstration that the marrow or blood has >20% blasts of myeloid lineage. Blast lineage is assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry with CD33 and CD13 being surface markers typically expressed by myeloid blasts. It should be realized that clinical/prognostic considerations, not the blast % per se, should be the main factor determining how a patient is treated. RISK STRATIFICATION: Two features determine risk: the probability of treatment-related mortality (TRM) and, more important, even in patients aged >75 with Zubrod performance status 1, the probability of resistance to standard therapy despite not incurring TRM. The chief predictor of resistance is cytogenetics with a monosomal karyotype (MK) denoting the disease is essentially incurable with standard therapy even if followed by a standard allogeneic transplant (HCT). The most common cytogenetic finding is a normal karyotype (NK) and those of such patients with an NPM1 mutation but no FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), or with a CEBPA mutation, have a prognosis similar to that of patients with the most favorable cytogenetics [inv(16) or t(8;21)] (60-70% cure rate). In contrast, NK patients with a FLT3 ITD have only a 30-40% chance of cure even after HCT. Accordingly analyses of NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA should be part of routine evaluation, much as is cytogenetics. Risk is best assessed considering several variables simultaneously rather than, for example, only age. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Patients with inv(16) or t(8;21) or who are NPM1+/FLT3ITD- can receive standard therapy (daunorubicin + cytarabine) and should not receive HCT in first CR. It seems likely that use of a daily daunorubicin dose of 90 mg/m(2) will further improve outcome in these patients. There appears no reason to use doses of cytarabine > 1 g/m(2) (for example, bid x 6 days), as opposed to the more commonly used 3 g/m(2) . Patients with an unfavorable karyotype (particularly MK) are unlikely to benefit from standard therapy (even with dose escalation) and are thus prime candidates for clinical trials of new drugs or new approaches to HCT; the latter should be done in first CR. Patients with intermediate prognoses (for example, NK and NPM and FLT3ITD negative) should also receive HCT in first CR and can plausibly receive either investigational or standard induction therapy, with the same prognostic information about standard therapy leading one patient to choose the standard and another an investigational option.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, USA. eestey@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22246 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Jan;87(1):89-99. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22246.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are limited therapeutic options available for these diseases, and single agents have only modest efficacy. In this phase 2 study, the authors combined multiple active agents (thalidomide, arsenic trioxide, dexamethasone, and ascorbic acid [TADA]) to treat patients with these disorders. METHODS: This multicenter trial was conducted from January 2005 to July 2007. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of TADA therapy. Patients received the combination for one 12-week cycle followed by maintenance thalidomide for an additional 3 months. Response was assessed using International Working Group criteria. RESULTS: Among 28 enrolled patients, the median age was 66.5 years; 15 patients had MDS/MPN-unclassifiable, 8 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 1, and 5 patients had PMF. Approximately 60% of the patients had normal cytogenetics. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 5 of 14 tested patients, and TET2 mutations were detected in 2 of 8 tested patients. Almost half of the patients had splenomegaly. With a median on-study follow-up of 5.7 months, 21 patients (75%) completed the entire 12-week course of therapy, and 6 patients (29%) responded to TADA. With a median extended follow-up of 24.1 months for 15 evaluable patients, the median progression-free survival was 14.4 months, and the median overall survival was 21.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: The TADA regimen yielded clinical responses in patients with PMF and MDS/MPN. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first trial targeting this patient population. The results indicated that it is reasonable to incorporate multiple novel agents in the treatment of these rare diseases.","['Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Raza, Azra', 'Jankowska, Ania', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Chan, Josephine', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Mooney, Lindsey', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Bejanyan N', 'Tiu RV', 'Raza A', 'Jankowska A', 'Kalaycio M', 'Advani A', 'Chan J', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Mooney L', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Sekeres MA']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26741 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Aug 15;118(16):3968-76. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26741.

However many types of solid cancer cells are resistant to ABT-737. One practical approach to improve its therapeutic efficacy is to combine with the agents that can overcome such resistance to restore the sensitivity. In the present study, a second-generation selenium compound methylseleninic acid (MSeA) synergistically sensitized MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, HT-29 human colon cancer cells and DU145 human prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induction by ABT-737, as evidenced by greater than additive enhancement of Annexin V/FITC positive (apoptotic) cells and activation of multiple caspases and PARP cleavage. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that MSeA significantly decreased basal Mcl-1 expression and ABT-737-induced Mcl-1 expression. Knocking down of Mcl-1 with RNAi approach supported the functional significance of this molecular target. More importantly, we identified inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation on ser-136 and ser-112 as a novel mechanism involved in ABT-737 resistance, which can be overcome by combining with MSeA. In addition, we found that expression of Bax was required for the efficient execution of synergistic sensitization. Our findings, for the first time, provide a strong mechanistic rationale for developing MSeA as a novel sensitizing agent of ABT-737.","['Yin, Shutao', 'Dong, Yinhui', 'Li, Jinghua', 'Fan, Lihong', 'Wang, Lei', 'Lu, Junxuan', 'Vang, Ole', 'Hu, Hongbo']","['Yin S', 'Dong Y', 'Li J', 'Fan L', 'Wang L', 'Lu J', 'Vang O', 'Hu H']","['Division of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University, Haidian District, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '9900C6V162 (methylselenic acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0687-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Apr;17(4):388-99. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0687-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess whether 5-aza-CdR and TSA inhibit the growth of leukaemia cells and induce caspase-3-dependent apoptosis by upregulating RUNX3 expression. METHODS: K562 and Reh cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR, TSA or both compounds. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were used to examine the expression of RUNX3 at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect the cellular location of RUNX3. Additionally, after K562 cells were transfected with RUNX3, apoptosis and proliferation were studied using Annexin V staining and MTT assays. RESULTS: The expression of RUNX3 in leukaemia cell lines was markedly less than that in the controls. Demethylating drug 5-aza-CdR could induce RUNX3 expression, but the combination of TSA and 5-aza-CdR had a greater effect than did treatment with a single compound. The combination of 5-aza-CdR and TSA induced the translocation of RUNX3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. TSA enhanced apoptosis induced by 5-aza-CdR, and Annexin V and Hoechst 33258 staining showed that the combination induced apoptosis but not necrosis. Furthermore, apoptosis was dependent on the caspase-3 pathway. RUNX3 overexpression in K562 cells led to growth inhibition and apoptosis and potentiated the effects of 5-aza-CdR induction. CONCLUSION: RUNX3 plays an important role in leukaemia cellular functions, and the induction of RUNX3-mediated effects may contribute to the therapeutic value of combination TSA and 5-aza-CdR treatment.","['Zhai, Feng-Xian', 'Liu, Xiang-Fu', 'Fan, Rui-Fang', 'Long, Zi-Jie', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Lu, Ying', 'Zheng, Yong-Jiang', 'Lin, Dong-Jun']","['Zhai FX', 'Liu XF', 'Fan RF', 'Long ZJ', 'Fang ZG', 'Lu Y', 'Zheng YJ', 'Lin DJ']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510630, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111218,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-011-1113-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar;138(3):439-49. doi: 10.1007/s00432-011-1113-y.

The only current drug available for clinical treatment of HCC is sorafenib, which inhibits multiple signaling kinases including Raf family members, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2, c-Kit, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3. Many studies have revealed that the mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of sorafenib is complex. Because sorafenib inhibits C-Raf more potently than B-Raf, the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib is strongly influenced by the relative expression and activity of B-Raf and C-Raf and the complex interactions between these factors. Moreover, Rafindependent signaling mechanisms have recently emerged as important pathways of sorafenib-induced cell death. Basic research studies have suggested that using sorafenib as part of a combination therapy may improve its effect, although this has yet to be confirmed by clinical evidence. Further studies of the functional mechanism of sorafenib are required to advance the development of targeted therapy for HCC. To aid future work on sorafenib, we here review the current literature pertaining to sorafenib signaling and its clinical efficacy in both monotherapy and combination therapy.","['Matsuda, Yasunobu', 'Fukumoto, Manabu']","['Matsuda Y', 'Fukumoto M']","['Department of Medical Technology, Niigata University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Asahimachi-dori, Niigata, Japan. yasunobu@med.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111217,Japan,Med Mol Morphol,Medical molecular morphology,101239023,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/prevention & control', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'raf Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00795-011-0558-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Mol Morphol. 2011 Dec;44(4):183-9. doi: 10.1007/s00795-011-0558-z.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of aspirin on the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line in vitro and the HepG2 cell xenograft model in BALB/c nude mice. We found that treatment with aspirin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis involving both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways as measured by DNA ladder formation, alteration in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activation of the caspase activities and related protein expressions. In vivo antitumor activity assay also showed that aspirin resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared to the control.

The THP-1 cell line, which was originally established from an infant diagnosed with AML, provides an experimental model for functional, pre-clinical therapeutics and target identification studies of AML. Here we show the expression of the voltage gated potassium channel Kv11.1 in THP-1 cells as opposed to normal hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from the plant Curcuma longa, effectively blocked Kv11.1 activity and also inhibited the proliferation of these cells. Curcumin was rapidly internalized by THP-1 cells and possibly exerts potential growth inhibitory activity by interacting with intracellular epitopes of the ion channel. Inhibition of ionic currents carried by Kv11.1 resulted in depolarization of cell membrane potential. We propose that the inhibition of Kv11.1 activity by curcumin may lead to interference with leukemic cell physiology and consequently the suppression of survival and proliferation of AML cells.","['Banderali, Umberto', 'Belke, Darrell', 'Singh, Anjali', 'Jayanthan, Aarthi', 'Giles, Wayne R', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Banderali U', 'Belke D', 'Singh A', 'Jayanthan A', 'Giles WR', 'Narendran A']","['Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. ubanderali@kin.ucalgary.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Curcuma/chemistry', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000335850 [pii]', '10.1159/000335850 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2011;28(6):1169-80. doi: 10.1159/000335850.

However the net effect of drug combination may not be easily anticipated solely from available knowledge of drug-induced death mechanisms. We evaluated the combined effect of sodium arsenite with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and the anti-leukaemic agent CAPE, on growth-inhibition and cell death effect in acute myeloid leukaemic cells U937 and Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji cells, by the Chou-Talalay method. In addition we explored the association of cytotoxic effect of drugs with changes in intracellular superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) levels. Our results showed that combined arsenite+MG132 produced low levels of O(2)(-) at 6h and 24h after exposure and were synergic on cell death induction in U937 cells over the whole dose range, although the combination was antagonistic on growth inhibition effect. Exposure to a constant non-cytotoxic dose of 80muM hydrogen peroxide together with arsenite+MG132 changed synergism on cell death to antagonism at all effect levels while increasing O(2)(-) levels. Arsenite+hydrogen peroxide also resulted in antagonism with increased O(2)(-) levels in U937 cells. In Raji cells, arsenite+MG132 also produced low levels of O(2)(-) at 6h and 24h but resulted in antagonism on cell death and growth inhibition. By contrast, the combination arsenite+CAPE showed high levels of O(2)(-) production at 6h and 24 h post exposure but resulted in antagonism over cell death and growth inhibition effects in U937 and Raji cells. We conclude that synergism between arsenite and MG132 in U937 cells is negatively associated to O(2)(-) levels at early time points after exposure.","['Lombardo, Tomas', 'Cavaliere, Victoria', 'Costantino, Susana N', 'Kornblihtt, Laura', 'Alvarez, Elida M', 'Blanco, Guillermo A']","['Lombardo T', 'Cavaliere V', 'Costantino SN', 'Kornblihtt L', 'Alvarez EM', 'Blanco GA']","['Laboratorio de Immunotoxicologia (LaITO), IDEHU-CONICET, Hospital de Clinicas, Jose de San Martin, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111208,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leupeptins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(11)00454-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2011.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2012 Feb 1;258(3):351-66. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2011.11.018.

Stem cell transplantation, an accepted curative option for which extensive experience has been gained, is limited by high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in older patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL are widely used and induce remission in a high proportion of patients, but resistance and incomplete response to these agents portends eventual relapse and disease progression. Although BCR-ABL inhibitors eradicate most CML cells, they are largely ineffective against the reservoir of quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Thus a strong medical need exists for therapies that effectively eradicate LSCs and is currently a focus of extensive research. To date, evidence obtained from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical CML specimens suggests that an effective approach may be to partner existing BCR-ABL inhibitors with compounds targeting key stem cell molecular effectors, including Wnt/beta-catenin, hedgehog pathway components, histone deacetylase (HDAC), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Janus kinase 2, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). Novel combinations may sensitize LSCs to BCR-ABL inhibitors, thereby overcoming resistance and creating the possibility of improving disease outcome beyond the current standard of care.","['Al Baghdadi, Tareq', 'Abonour, Rafat', 'Boswell, H Scott']","['Al Baghdadi T', 'Abonour R', 'Boswell HS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20111216,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00576-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Apr;12(2):94-105. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.003.

Moreover, chronic HEV infection and associated-cirrhosis have been described in severely immunocompromized patients. Nonetheless, only few studies have focused on pediatric HEV infections worldwide and only four autochthonous cases have been reported in children in developed countries. We describe here acute hepatitis E in three immunocompromized children. Case no. 1 was a 9-year-old liver transplant recipient girl in whom H1N1 2009 flu infection was diagnosed concurrently with hepatitis E. Case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy presenting early medullar relapse of lymphoblastic leukemia of type B and in whom HEV RNA was detected over a 29-week period. Case no. 3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. HEV infections were all autochthonously acquired and involved different viruses classified as subtype f, c, and e of genotype 3, which are those described in autochthonous cases in Europe. These three observations prompt to consider HEV as a causative agent of hepatitis in children in developed countries, and to perform particularly HEV testing in those severely immunocompromized who may develop chronic hepatitis E.","['Motte, Anne', 'Roquelaure, Bertrand', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Bernard, Fanette', 'Zandotti, Christine', 'Colson, Philippe']","['Motte A', 'Roquelaure B', 'Galambrun C', 'Bernard F', 'Zandotti C', 'Colson P']","['Pole des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Clinique et Biologique, Federation de Bacteriologie-Hygiene-Virologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Timone, 264 rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille CEDEX 05, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111216,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,"['0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'Coinfection/epidemiology/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis E/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Hepatitis E virus/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications/epidemiology', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza, Human/complications/epidemiology/virology', 'Liver Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/epidemiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/deficiency']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1386-6532(11)00474-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2011.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2012 Feb;53(2):162-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2011.11.012.

The different percentage of male and female cats observed to be infected by feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been traditionally explained through the transmission mechanisms of both viruses. However, sexual hormones may also play a role in this different distribution. To study this possibility, 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations were analyzed using a competitive enzyme immunoassay in the plasma of 258 cats naturally infected by FIV (FIV(+)), FeLV (FeLV(+)), or FeLV and FIV (F(-)F(+)) or negative for both viruses, including both sick and clinically healthy animals. Results indicated that the concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and testosterone were significantly higher in animals infected with FIV or FeLV (P < 0.05) than in negative cats. Plasma concentrations of DHEA in cats infected by either retrovirus were lower than in negative animals (P < 0.05), and F(-)F(+) cats had significantly lower plasma values than monoinfected cats (P < 0.05). No significant differences were detected in the plasma concentration of progesterone of the four groups. No relevant differences were detected in the hormone concentrations between animal genders, except that FIV(+) females had higher DHEA concentrations than the corresponding males (P < 0.05). In addition, no differences were observed in the hormone concentrations between retrovirus-infected and noninfected animals with and without clinical signs. These results suggest that FIV and FeLV infections are associated with an important deregulation of steroids, possibly from early in the infection process, which might have decisive consequences for disease progression.","['Tejerizo, G', 'Domenech, A', 'Illera, J-C', 'Silvan, G', 'Gomez-Lucia, E']","['Tejerizo G', 'Domenech A', 'Illera JC', 'Silvan G', 'Gomez-Lucia E']","['Department of Animal Health, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111127,United States,Domest Anim Endocrinol,Domestic animal endocrinology,8505191,"['0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/blood', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*blood/virology', 'Female', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*blood', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/*blood/virology', 'Male', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Testosterone/blood']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0739-7240(11)00150-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Domest Anim Endocrinol. 2012 Feb;42(2):113-20. doi: 10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.11.001.

Excellent biocompatibility was observed for the entire hydroxyl functional bis-MPA dendrimer library, whereas the cationic, but not the neutral PAMAM exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity in cell lines and primary macrophages. Studies to evaluate material stability as a function of pH, temperature, and time, demonstrated that the stability of the 4th generation hydroxyl functional bis-MPA dendrimer increased at acidic pH.

We examined the effect of a specific GSK-3 inhibitor (SB-415286) on the regulation of leukemic cells proliferation and apoptosis. SB-415286 (40 muM) induced cell growth inhibition, beta-catenin stabilization, cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase, cyclin B1 downregulation, and apoptosis in leukemic cell lines KG1a, K562, and CMK. Blocking the death receptor pathway by using a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, did not inhibit SB-415286-induced apoptosis. This indicates that activation of caspase-8 is part of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and occurs downstream of mitochondria membrane potential depolarization mediated by other caspases. Furthermore, we found that depolarization of mitochondria membrane caused by GSK-3 inhibition is regulated by dephosphorylation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bcl-xL. Thus, inhibition of GSK-3-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells could be an attractive target for treatment of leukemia.","['Mirlashari, Mohammad Reza', 'Randen, Ingrid', 'Kjeldsen-Kragh, Jens']","['Mirlashari MR', 'Randen I', 'Kjeldsen-Kragh J']","['Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. reza@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/04/12 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00563-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Apr;36(4):499-508. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.11.013.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single institution 119 men with seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis were retrospectively identified. Annual and lifetime exposure to radiation was determined for each histological subtype. Values were assessed for compliance with International Commission of Radiological Protection guidelines. RESULTS: The cohorts included 55 patients with seminomatous and 64 with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. Between the groups no difference was found in the lifetime (215.5 and 214.1 mSV, p = 0.96) or the annual (104.6 and 104.6 mSV, respectively, p = 1.0) radiation dose. Of the 41 patients with more than 5-year followup 32 (78%) were in violation of guidelines by exceeding 20 mSV per year of radiation. Also, 74 patients (61.7%) received 50 mSV or greater of radiation during a 1-year period. Using the previously calculated excess relative risk for solid cancer and leukemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the RR was 1.06 and 1.33, [corrected] respectively, with a 2.1% lifetime risk of fatal cancer over the baseline risk. CONCLUSIONS: At a tertiary care center with experience with managing testicular cancer 78% of patients with more than 5 years of followup exceeded current national and standard safety limits for radiation exposure. Imaging should be done judiciously in this population at high risk for radiation overexposure.","['Silva, Mark V', 'Motamedinia, Piruz', 'Badalato, Gina M', 'Hruby, Gregory', 'McKiernan, James M']","['Silva MV', 'Motamedinia P', 'Badalato GM', 'Hruby G', 'McKiernan JM']","['Department of Urology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111215,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5347(11)05272-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2011.10.028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2012 Feb;187(2):482-6. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2011.10.028.

METHODS: It was a retrospective case series study. The clinical aspects of 17 orbital chloroma cases were analyzed, which included symptoms, signs, imageology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. RESULTS: Orbit chloroma was more prevalent in males, and usually occurred in children and individuals under 14 years old. The main symptoms were exophthalmos and orbit masses. B ultrasonic examination was performed in 16 cases, which found that the mass was located in the temporal side of the orbit, with irregular shape and clear edge. Color doppler imaging was performed in 5 cases, which found that the sufficient blood supply signal was the main manifestation. CT scan was performed in 11 cases, which revealed that the mass was located in temporal side of the orbit, with irregular shape, regular density, a clear edge and seldom destruction of the orbital bone. Blood examination was performed in 17 cases, which revealed the increase of white blood cells and the presence of numerous immature blood cells. Sixteen cases were referred to the department of hematology for treatment. In 4 following cases, 2 cases were died within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital chloroma can be easily misdiagnosed as other types of malignant orbital tumor in children. The diagnosis of orbital chloroma can be established by radiology and hematological examinations. This tumor can be treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Ke, Yi-feng', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Song, Guo-xiang']","['Ke YF', 'Zhang H', 'Song GX']","['Department of Ophthalmology, the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300211, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,16210540R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis']",2011/12/20 06:00,2012/07/07 06:00,['2011/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2011 Sep;47(9):811-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of iNKT cells can protect against multiple diseases in mice but clinical trials in humans have had limited impact. Clinical studies to date have targeted polyclonal mixtures of iNKT cells and we proposed that their subset compositions will influence therapeutic outcomes. We sorted and expanded iNKT cells from healthy donors and compared the phenotypes, cytotoxic activities and cytokine profiles of the CD4(+), CD8alpha(+) and CD4(-)CD8alpha(-) double-negative (DN) subsets. CD4(+) iNKT cells expanded more readily than CD8alpha(+) and DN iNKT cells upon mitogen stimulation. CD8alpha(+) and DN iNKT cells most frequently expressed CD56, CD161 and NKG2D and most potently killed CD1d(+) cell lines and primary leukemia cells. All iNKT subsets released Th1 (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) cytokines. Relative amounts followed a CD8alpha>DN>CD4 pattern for Th1 and CD4>DN>CD8alpha for Th2. All iNKT subsets could simultaneously produce IFN-gamma and IL-4, but single-positivity for IFN-gamma or IL-4 was strikingly rare in CD4(+) and CD8alpha(+) fractions, respectively. Only CD4(+) iNKT cells produced IL-9 and IL-10; DN cells released IL-17; and none produced IL-22. All iNKT subsets upregulated CD40L upon glycolipid stimulation and induced IL-10 and IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells. Thus, subset composition of iNKT cells is a major determinant of function. Use of enriched CD8alpha(+), DN or CD4(+) iNKT cells may optimally harness the immunoregulatory properties of iNKT cells for treatment of disease.","[""O'Reilly, Vincent"", 'Zeng, Shijuan G', 'Bricard, Gabriel', 'Atzberger, Ann', 'Hogan, Andrew E', 'Jackson, John', 'Feighery, Conleth', 'Porcelli, Steven A', 'Doherty, Derek G']","[""O'Reilly V"", 'Zeng SG', 'Bricard G', 'Atzberger A', 'Hogan AE', 'Jackson J', 'Feighery C', 'Porcelli SA', 'Doherty DG']","[""Department of Immunology and Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/drug effects/immunology']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028648 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21013 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28648. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028648.

Genomic Southern blots demonstrated a reduced TCTA signal in three of four small cell lung cancer cell lines, suggesting the loss of one of the two copies of the gene. In the current paper, we reviewed the roles of TCTA protein in lung cancer cell lines and human osteoclastogenesis.","['Kotake, Shigeru', 'Yago, Toru', 'Kawamoto, Manabu', 'Nanke, Yuki']","['Kotake S', 'Yago T', 'Kawamoto M', 'Nanke Y']","[""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 10-22 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-0054, Japan. skotake@ior.twmu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111124,United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (TCTA protein, human)', 'S8S8451A4O (geranylgeranylacetone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Osteoclasts/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/metabolism', 'Synovial Membrane/metabolism']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/675317 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:675317. doi: 10.1155/2012/675317.

There is a recent interest to observe incidence and mortality because of advent of new diagnostic and treatment policies for CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted data from the oldest population-based cancer registry of Mumbai for 30 years period from 1976-2005 to observe incidence and mortality rates of CML. We classified the data into four age groups 0-14, 15-29, 30-54 and 55-74 to observe incidence rates in the respective age groups. RESULTS: The age specific rates were highest for the age group of 55-74 years. No significant change in trends of CML was observed for 30 years period. However, there was a significant reduction in incidence rate for recent 15-years period (Estimated average annual percentage change=-3.9). No significant reduction in mortality rate was observed till 2005. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that age-specific rates for CML are highest in age group of 55-74 years, although they are lower compared to western populations. Significant reduction in incidence of CML in recent periods might be because of reduced misclassification of leukemias. The data of CML has to be observed for another decade to witness reduction in mortality because of changes in treatment management.","['Dikshit, Rajesh P', 'Nagrani, Rajini', 'Yeole, Balkrishna', 'Koyande, Shravani', 'Banawali, Shripad']","['Dikshit RP', 'Nagrani R', 'Yeole B', 'Koyande S', 'Banawali S']","['Department of Epidemiology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,2011/12/17 06:00,2011/12/17 06:01,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.89792 [doi]', 'IJMPO-32-96 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2011 Apr;32(2):96-100. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.89792.,,PMC3237188,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'estimated annual percentage change', 'imatinib']",,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic calcium disorders in childhood cancers of patients admitted to the pediatric ward of Vali-Asr Hospital from the year 2001-2008. The study was carried out by reviewing hospital records of these patients from the hospital archives. Range of age was between 1 and 18 years. Inclusion criteria for the study population were the presence of total serum calcium evaluated at least once; and for the hypercalcemia subgroup, at least two occasions of elevated calcium levels. The prevalence of hypercalcemia and other metabolic abnormalities of phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, urea and creatinine; the prevalence of parameters such as age, gender, type and duration of cancer were determined within these groups. Median of elevated calcium levels was also determined to classify hypercalcemia into moderate and severe hypercalcemia. Median was 11.7 mg/dl, therefore, severe hypercalcemia was >/=11.7 mg/dl and moderate hypercalcemia, a range between the upper limit of normal, 10.8 and 10.2 mg/dl for the child and adolescent respectively, and 11.7 mg/dl. Relationship between hypercalcemia and the other metabolic disorders and parameters were analyzed by the SPSS V.17 program. The population of study consisted of 148 cases. Hypercalcemia was found in 8 (5.4%) patients. Half of the cases were associated with severe hypercalcemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Out of 148 cases, there were 92 (62%) boys and 56 (38%) girls. Mean and median ages were 10.9 and 11 years respectively. Mean duration of cancer was 12.8 and median 6 months. There were 57 (38.5%) cases of leukemia and 91 (61.5%) cases of solid tumors. The most common cancers were ALL, 44 cases (29.7%) followed by brain tumors, 19 cases (12.8%); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 16 cases (10.8%); 13 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (8.8%); 13 cases of Ewing sarcoma (8.8%); osteosarcoma, 9 cases (6.1%); Hodgkin's lymphoma, 6 cases (4.1%); others, 19.1%.

It is less clear whether these responses are durable. In the present study, we report the clinical outcome of 119 patients who received a 2G-TKI as second-line treatment while still in the chronic phase. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the 4-year probabilities of overall and event-free survival were 81.9% and 35.3%, respectively. Sixty-two patients discontinued the initial 2G-TKI because of resistance or intolerance. To further explore the durability of cytogenetic responses, irrespective of the need for a third-line TKI, we used the concept of ""current CCyR-survival"" (c-CCyRS). The c-CCyRS at 4 years was 54.4%.

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.","['Ting, Stephen B', 'Deneault, Eric', 'Hope, Kristin', 'Cellot, Sonia', 'Chagraoui, Jalila', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Dorn, Jonas F', 'Laverdure, Jean-Philippe', 'Harvey, Michael', 'Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Russell, Sarah M', 'Maddox, Paul S', 'Iscove, Norman N', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Ting SB', 'Deneault E', 'Hope K', 'Cellot S', 'Chagraoui J', 'Mayotte N', 'Dorn JF', 'Laverdure JP', 'Harvey M', 'Hawkins ED', 'Russell SM', 'Maddox PS', 'Iscove NN', 'Sauvageau G']","['Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells Laboratory, Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. stephen.ting@monash.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (adaptor protein complex 2, alpha 2 subunit)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Asymmetric Cell Division/*physiology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Endocytosis/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45935-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-393272 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 15;119(11):2510-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-393272.

Here we show that ASB2, a component of the ECS(ASB) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, mediates MLL degradation through interaction with the PHD/Bromodomain region of MLL. Forced expression of ASB2 degrades MLL and reduces MLL transactivation activity. In contrast, the MLL-AF9 fusion protein does not interact with ASB2 and is resistant to ASB2 mediated degradation. Increased expression of ASB2 during hematopoietic differentiation is associated with decreased levels of MLL protein and down-regulation of MLL target genes. Knockdown of ASB2 leads to increased expression of HOXA9 and delayed cell differentiation. Our data support a model whereby ASB2 contributes to hematopoietic differentiation, in part, through MLL degradation and HOX gene down-regulation. Moreover, deletion of the PHD/Bromo region renders MLL fusion proteins resistant to ASB2-mediated degradation and may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Jingya', 'Muntean, Andrew G', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Wang J', 'Muntean AG', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ASB2 protein, human)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Elongin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cullin Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Elongin', 'HEK293 Cells', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics/physiology', '*Proteolysis', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transfection']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46141-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-362079 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 2;119(5):1151-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-362079.

We recently found that targeted deletion in mice of the 0.11 megabase (mb)-long minimal deleted region (MDR) encompassing the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster recapitulates the spectrum of CLL-associated lymphoproliferations in humans, including CLL, CD5(+) monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and CD5(-) non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the present study, we demonstrate that additional deletion of the 0.69-mb large genomic region telomeric to the MDR called the common deleted region (CDR) changed the spectrum of lymphoproliferations developing in CDR- versus MDR-deleted mice in that the number of CLL among B-cell lymphoproliferations was significantly elevated in the former. In addition, CDR-deleted mice seemed to succumb to their disease faster than MDR-deleted mice. Comparing HCDR3 regions of CD5(+) lymphoproliferations derived from this and published CLL mouse models, 44% (29 of 66) of junctions could be assigned to 8 sets of highly similar HCDR3 regions, demonstrating that CLL developing in mice frequently expresses almost identical, stereotypic Ag receptors. These results suggest that the size of 13q14 deletions influences the phenotype of the developing lymphoproliferations and potentially the severity of disease, suggesting a tumor-suppressor function for genetic elements in addition to DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1.","['Lia, Marie', 'Carette, Amanda', 'Tang, Hongyan', 'Shen, Qiong', 'Mo, Tongwei', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo', 'Klein, Ulf']","['Lia M', 'Carette A', 'Tang H', 'Shen Q', 'Mo T', 'Bhagat G', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Klein U']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111215,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Lethal/physiology', '*Genetic Loci/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Sequence Deletion/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49165-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-381814 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 29;119(13):2981-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-381814.

Based on data from stem cell research, we hypothesized that the human inhibitory C-type lectin like receptor (hMICL) might represent a novel diagnostic and prognostic vehicle in a standard flow cytometry (FCM) setting. METHODS: Standard four-color FCM was employed to uncover the expression patterns of hMICL in bone marrow in a test set of 55 retrospectively collected diagnostic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and in a set of 36 prospectively collected diagnostic AML samples. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the AML patients stained positive for hMICL and in the otherwise poorly characterized CD34 negative patient group hMICL staining revealed a very homogenous expression profile in the blast cell compartment with a mean of 88% hMICL positive cells. Moreover, hMICL displayed significantly higher expression in AML as compared with normal donors as measured by median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratios (P = 0.01). There was no difference in hMICL MFI ratios between the CD34 positive and the CD34 negative subgroups (P = 0.89). Importantly, there was no difference in MFI ratios between paired diagnostic and relapse samples (P = 0.76) in 23 cases studied, indicating stable expression of hMICL during the course of the disease. In contrast to the other stem cell associated antigens analyzed (CD34, CD96, CD117, and CD133), hMICL was expressed on myeloid blast cells only, revealing hMICL as a diagnostic marker in AML. CONCLUSION: These data identify hMICL as a myeloid leukemia-associated antigen and establishes its applicability for diagnosis and follow-up of AML patients in a standard FCM setting.","['Larsen, Hanne O', 'Roug, Anne S', 'Just, Tom', 'Brown, Gordon D', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Larsen HO', 'Roug AS', 'Just T', 'Brown GD', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, The Laboratory of Immunohematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110830,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The increased expression of P-glycoprotein (MDR1, P-gp, ABCB1) in tumor cells contributes to drug resistance by extruding chemotherapeutic agents or by regulating programmed cell death. In a study of MDR cell survival under cold stress conditions, it was found that resistant leukemic cells with P-gp over-expression, but not their sensitive counterparts, are hypersensitive to cold-induced cell death when exposed to temperatures below 4 degrees C. The transfection of parental cells with a P-gp-expressing plasmid makes these cells sensitive to cold stress, demonstrating an association between P-gp expression and cell death at low temperatures. Furthermore, we observed increased basal expression and activity of effector caspase-3 at physiological temperature (37 degrees C) in MDR cells compared with their parental cell line. Treatment with a caspase-3 inhibitor partially rescues MDR leukemic cells from cold-induced apoptosis, which suggests that the cell death mechanism may require caspase-3 activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that P-gp expression plays a role in MDR cell survival, and is accompanied by a collateral sensitivity to death induced by cold stress. These findings may assist in the design of specific therapeutic strategies to complement current chemotherapy treatment against cancer.","['Cerezo, David', 'Lencina, Miriam', 'Ruiz-Alcaraz, Antonio J', 'Ferragut, Jose Antonio', 'Saceda, Miguel', 'Sanchez, Manuel', 'Canovas, Manuel', 'Garcia-Penarrubia, Pilar', 'Martin-Orozco, Elena']","['Cerezo D', 'Lencina M', 'Ruiz-Alcaraz AJ', 'Ferragut JA', 'Saceda M', 'Sanchez M', 'Canovas M', 'Garcia-Penarrubia P', 'Martin-Orozco E']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology B and Immunology, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cold Temperature', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', '*Stress, Physiological']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Apr;113(4):1416-25. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24016.,,,,,"['(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has become increasingly clear that induction therapy should be initiated in patients at the earliest time possible, even before confirmation of the diagnosis of APL has been made. In this roundtable, several experts discuss important insights into the high rate of early death observed in APL. In addition to the importance of rapid diagnosis, the pathophysiology of the coagulopathy associated with APL will be discussed, as will factors that may be predictive of early death and potential interventions to prevent this important limitation to the cure of many, if not most, patients.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Kwaan, Hau C', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Tallman MS', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Kwaan HC', 'Sanz MA', 'Gore SD']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Congress'],,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['Early Detection of Cancer/*mortality', 'Florida', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/*mortality']",2011/02/01 00:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2011 Feb;9(2 Suppl 3):1-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibiting antiapoptotic BCL-2 and its relatives is an attractive strategy for sensitizing lymphoid malignancies to drugs but it has been largely unsuccessful for melanoma and other solid tumors. ABT-737, a small-molecule BH3-mimetic, selectively inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-w and shows promise for treating leukemia, lymphoma, and small-cell lung cancer. Melanoma cells are insensitive to ABT-737, but MCL-1 inhibition reportedly increases the sensitivity of other tumors to the compound. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The efficacy of MCL-1 and BFL-1 inhibition for sensitizing melanoma cells to ABT-737 was investigated by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression of their antagonist NOXA in two-dimensional cell culture, a three-dimensional organotypic spheroid model, and an in vivo model. RESULTS: MCL-1 downregulation or NOXA overexpression strongly sensitized melanoma cells to ABT-737 in vitro. NOXA-inducing cytotoxic drugs also strongly sensitized melanomas to ABT-737 but, surprisingly, not vice versa. The drugs most suitable are not necessarily those normally used to treat melanoma. Resistance to ABT-737 occurred quickly in three-dimensional melanoma spheroids through reduced NOXA expression, although experiments with both xenografts and three-dimensional spheroids suggest that penetration of ABT-737 into tumor masses may be the principal limitation, which may be obviated through use of more diffusible BH3-mimetics. CONCLUSION: Sensitization of tumors to BH3-mimetics by cytotoxic drugs that induce NOXA is a therapeutic strategy worth exploring for the treatment of melanoma and other solid cancers.","['Lucas, Keryn M', 'Mohana-Kumaran, Nethia', 'Lau, Diana', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Hersey, Peter', 'Huang, David C', 'Weninger, Wolfgang', 'Haass, Nikolas K', 'Allen, John D']","['Lucas KM', 'Mohana-Kumaran N', 'Lau D', 'Zhang XD', 'Hersey P', 'Huang DC', 'Weninger W', 'Haass NK', 'Allen JD']","['The Centenary Institute, Newtown, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1166 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1166 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Feb 1;18(3):783-95. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1166.

Immature CD8alpha(+) DCs were prepared from C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) bone marrow cells by using a cytokine cocktail. On the 3rd day of culture, CD8alpha(+) DCs were pulsed by allogeneic (Balb/c, H-2(d)) EL9611 leukemia antigen, or RM-1 syngeneic prostate cancer antigen, with the concentration series of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mug/mL, respectively, then antigen-loaded immature CD8alpha(+) DCs were co-cultured with syngeneic T cells according to the DC/T ratio of 1:1, 2:1 and 4:1. T cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in CD8alpha(+) DCs and T co-culture supernatant were detected by using ELISA. Cytotoxic effect of antigen-specific T cells was tested by LDH release assay. Conventional mature DCs (mDCs) induced from C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) bone marrow cells by using granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) served as a control. The results showed that the proliferative activity of T cells stimulated by CD8alpha(+) DCs loaded with allogeneic or syngeneic tumor antigen was augmented with the CD8alpha(+) DC/T ratio increased (P<0.05). When antigen concentration </= 5 mug/mL and CD8alpha(+) DC/T ratio </= 2:1, the ability of CD8alpha(+) DCs to stimulate T cell proliferation was higher than mDC control in allogeneic tumor antigen-pulsed groups (P<0.05), but not in syngeneic tumor antigen-pulsed groups (P>0.05). The level of IFN-gamma and IL-10 in CD8alpha(+) DCs and T cell co-culture supernatant were increased in both allogeneic and syngeneic antigen-pulsed groups (P<0.05), and the cytokine level was higher in allogeneic antigen-pulsed groups than in syngeneic antigen groups when the CD8alpha(+) DC/T was 1:1 or 2:1 (P<0.05). There existed a negative correlation between the level of IL-10 and T cell proliferation. T cell cytotoxicity assay showed that when CD8alpha(+) DCs were pulsed with allogeneic tumor antigen, the maximal T cell killing efficiency could reach (100+/-7.7)%, whereas syngeneic tumor antigen-pulsed group had only (65.0+/-3.4)%. It was concluded that syngeneic and allogeneic tumor antigen-pulsed immature CD8alpha(+) DCs could stimulate T cells to exert the GVT effect in vitro, and the GVT effect was more obvious with allogeneic tumor antigen than with syngeneic tumor antigen. The optimal condition was low allogeneic tumor antigen pulsation (</= 5 mug/mL) and low CD8alpha(+) DC/T ratio (1:1 and 2:1).","['Na, Ning', 'Chen, Kang', 'Zhang, Jian', 'He, Shanyang', 'Fu, Qiang', 'Zhu, Beili', 'Cao, Kaiyuan', 'Xu, Lin']","['Na N', 'Chen K', 'Zhang J', 'He S', 'Fu Q', 'Zhu B', 'Cao K', 'Xu L']","['Department of Organ Transplantation, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Department of Organ Transplantation, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Huangpu Hospital & the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510700, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Dongguan Health School, Dongguan, 523000, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China. xulin@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Tyrosine kinases represent a good target for cancer treatment since they are involved in transferring phosphate groups from ATP to tyrosine residues in specific substrate proteins transducing intracellular signals engaged in the many mechanisms, playing an important role in the modulation of growth factors signaling that are strongly related to carcinogenesis. Deregulation of tyrosine kinases activity was also found in hematological malignancies, particularly overexpression of tyrosine kinases was observed in chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Herein we show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized hematology malignancies therapy in a very short period of time and they still remain one of the most interesting anticancer compounds that could give a hope for cure and not only long-lasting complete remission.

Chemokines are critical regulators of cell trafficking and adhesion, and have been reported to be aberrantly expressed and to correlate with an unfavorable prognosis and metastatic spread in several malignant tumors. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 together with their common ligand CXCL12 form one of the most important chemokine axes in this context. To investigate a potential role of these chemokines in OSs, we analyzed their expression in a series of 223 well-characterized and pretherapeutic OS samples. Interestingly, we found the expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 to correlate with a better long-term outcome and with a lower prevalence of metastases. These findings suggest a distinct role of CXCR4/CXCR7/CXCL12 signaling in the tumors of bone, as has also been previously described in acute leukemia. As many malignant tumors metastasize to bone, and tumor cells are thought to be directed to bone in response to CXCL12, OS cells expressing both CXCL12 and the corresponding receptors might be detained at their site of origin. The disruption of CXCR4/CXCR7/CXCL12 signaling could therefore be crucial in OSs for the migration of tumor cells from bone into circulation and for developing systemic disease.","['Baumhoer, Daniel', 'Smida, Jan', 'Zillmer, Stephanie', 'Rosemann, Michael', 'Atkinson, Michael J', 'Nelson, Peter J', 'Jundt, Gernot', 'von Luettichau, Irene', 'Nathrath, Michaela']","['Baumhoer D', 'Smida J', 'Zillmer S', 'Rosemann M', 'Atkinson MJ', 'Nelson PJ', 'Jundt G', 'von Luettichau I', 'Nathrath M']","['Bone Tumor Reference Center at the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. dbaumhoer@mac.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Neoplasms/*immunology/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Osteosarcoma/*immunology/mortality/secondary/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, CXCR/analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vimentin/analysis', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2011193 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2011.193 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2012 Apr;25(4):522-8. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2011.193.

Here, we report that inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) at subtoxic concentrations cooperate with various anticancer drugs (that is, AraC, Gemcitabine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Etoposide, Vincristine and Taxol) to induce apoptosis in ALL cells in a synergistic manner as calculated by combination index and to reduce long-term clonogenic survival. Importantly, we identify RIP1 as a critical regulator of this synergism of IAP inhibitors and AraC that mediates the formation of a RIP1/FADD/caspase-8 complex via an autocrine/paracrine loop of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Knockdown of RIP1 abolishes formation of this complex and subsequent activation of caspase-8 and -3, mitochondrial perturbations and apoptosis. Similarly, inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity by Necrostatin-1 or blockage of TNFalpha by Enbrel inhibits IAP inhibitor- and AraC-triggered interaction of RIP1, FADD and caspase-8 and apoptosis. In contrast to malignant cells, IAP inhibitors and AraC at equimolar concentrations are non-toxic to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes or mesenchymal stromal cells. Thus, our findings provide first evidence that IAP inhibitors present a promising strategy to prime childhood ALL cells for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a RIP1-dependent manner.

Patients included in this study represent four cytogenetically distinct subtypes of B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL and T-cell lineage ALL (T-ALL). The robustness of DGE combined with supervised classification by nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) was validated experimentally and by comparison with published expression data for large sets of ALL samples. Genes that were differentially expressed between BCP ALL subtypes were enriched to distinct signaling pathways with dic(9;20) enriched to TP53 signaling, t(9;22) to interferon signaling, as well as high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) to apoptosis signaling. We also observed antisense tags expressed from the non-coding strand of ~50% of annotated genes, many of which were expressed in a subtype-specific pattern.

Numbers and fate decisions made by progenitors derived from HSC must also be carefully regulated to sustain large-scale production of blood cells. The complex Wnt family of molecules generally is thought to be important to these processes, delivering critical signals to HSC and progenitors as they reside in specialized niches. Wnt proteins have also been extensively studied in connection with malignancies and are causatively involved in the development of several types of leukemias. However, studies with experimental animal models have produced contradictory findings regarding the importance of Wnt signals for normal hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Here, we will argue that dose dependency of signaling via particular Wnt pathways accounts for much, if not all of this controversy. We conclude that there seems little doubt that Wnt proteins are required to sustain normal hematopoiesis, but are likely to be presented in carefully controlled gradients in a tissue-specific manner.","['Luis, T C', 'Ichii, M', 'Brugman, M H', 'Kincade, P', 'Staal, F J T']","['Luis TC', 'Ichii M', 'Brugman MH', 'Kincade P', 'Staal FJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111215,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011387 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.387 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Mar;26(3):414-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.387.

Some have associated IDH1 mutations with inferior outcome, whereas others found no association with prognosis. Complicating these analyses is the need to sequence IDH1 from leukemic blasts, which is technically challenging and not yet routine. Mutation-specific antibodies enable robust, cost-effective detection of mutations in routine biopsy samples. Immunohistochemistry for the R132H mutation-specific antibody was performed in a tissue microarray containing 159 cases of AML, detecting the R132H mutation in 7 cases (4.4%). Positivity was associated with intermediate risk cytogenetics. Our results demonstrate an association between the R132H IDH1 mutation and intermediate risk cytogenetics in AML, suggesting that R132H IDH1 mutation may be associated with improved clinical outcome and demonstrate the feasibility of using mutation-specific antibodies to genotype and subclassify AML.","['Byers, Richard', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Kutok, Jeffery', 'Rodig, Scott J']","['Byers R', 'Hornick JL', 'Tholouli E', 'Kutok J', 'Rodig SJ']","['School of Cancer and Enabling Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. r.byers@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

These compounds had the basic skeleton of ABT-737 and the h2 residues of Bim BH3. These residues had shown themselves to be relevant to Bim BH3's broad-spectrum binding properties in saturation mutagenesis assays. Unlike ABT-737, which is a selective inhibitor of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family, the class A compounds showed broad-spectrum binding activity to target proteins similar to those of Bim BH3 peptide. Then class B compounds were synthesized by modifying the structure of the most effective class A compound, A-4. Most of these class B compounds showed better binding affinity to the target proteins than the class A compounds had. They also showed themselves more effective than ABT-737 at inhibiting growth in multiple tumor cell lines known to express Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 proteins at high levels. Compounds B-11 and B-12 had the strongest anti-tumor activity of any compounds we produced. This study suggests that it is feasible to design small-molecule inhibitors based on the structure of Bim BH3, which shows broad-spectrum binding to Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 proteins. Our results also suggest that the broad-spectrum properties of small-molecule inhibitors binding to target proteins play a critical role in inhibiting the growth of many tumor cells. Finally, our study provides a series of lead compounds that merit further research into anti-cancer therapeutics.","['Zheng, Can-Hui', 'Yang, Hui', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Lu, Shi-Hai', 'Shi, Duo', 'Wang, Juan', 'Chen, Xiu-Hua', 'Ren, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Jia', 'Lv, Jia-Guo', 'Zhu, Ju', 'Zhou, You-Jun']","['Zheng CH', 'Yang H', 'Zhang M', 'Lu SH', 'Shi D', 'Wang J', 'Chen XH', 'Ren XH', 'Liu J', 'Lv JG', 'Zhu J', 'Zhou YJ']","['School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(11)01645-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.11.101 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2012 Jan 1;22(1):39-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.11.101.

On multivariate analysis, older donor age (hazard ratio (HR): 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.15, P=0.004) and a high dose of CD56 cells (>2.80x10(6)/kg) (HR: 0.15, 95%CI: 0.03-0.92, P=0.040) were significant determinants of grade III-IV acute GVHD after unrelated BMT. None of the lymphocyte subpopulations had a significant impact on the outcome of transplantation, including the rate of neutrophil engraftment, relapse, relapse-free mortality, and overall survival. Our findings suggest that a high natural killer cell dose prevents severe acute GVHD after unrelated BMT, while sparing the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Kobayashi, Shoichi', 'Numata, Ayumi', 'Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Takasaki, Hirotaka', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa']","['Tanaka M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Numata A', 'Tachibana T', 'Takasaki H', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Kanamori H']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology/methods/rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*transplantation', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology/immunology/physiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00559-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Jun;36(6):699-703. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.11.009.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 and HL-60 apoptosis induced by active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores was quantified by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated annexin V and PI; MAPK and Akt were measured by Western blot, and caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities were also detected by spectrophotometric assay. RESULTS: Our results showed that active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores decreased phosphorylation-ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2), P-Akt and increased P-JNK1/2, but did not affect expressions of P-p38 MAPK in THP-1 cells. Moreover, treatment of THP-1 cells with active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores resulted in activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Furthermore, LY294002 (Akt inhibitor) or PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells, whereas caspase inhibitors or SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores is able to enhance apoptosis in THP-1 cells, at least in part, through inhibition of ERK1/2, Akt and activation of JNK1/2 signaling pathways. Moreover, it also triggers caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation mediated apoptotic induction.","['Wang, Jia-He', 'Zhou, Yi-Jun', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Kan, Liang', 'He, Ping']","['Wang JH', 'Zhou YJ', 'Zhang M', 'Kan L', 'He P']","['Department of Geriatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China. wangjh1@sj-hospital.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lipids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Reishi/chemistry', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spores, Fungal', 'Time Factors', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00864-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.055 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2012 Jan 31;139(2):582-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.055.

METHODS: The clinical data of 55 children who were diagnosed as t (8; 21)/AML1-ETO-positive AML were retrospectively studied. Event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated by COX regression analysis software. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients, 4 patients gave up treatment after the diagnosis was confirmed and 4 patients were lost to follow-up after the first chemotherapy course. The remaining 47 patients received a double-induction therapy. The total complete remission (CR) rate was 71% and 94% after the first and second chemotherapy course, respectively. The disease was relapsed in 10 patients (21%). The 5-year EFS, DFS and OS rates were (56.1 +/- 7.9)%, (59.8 +/- 8.1)%, and (72.0 +/- 8.1)%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age was an independent risk factor for the long-term prognosis. The older children had a greater risk of experiencing an accident or death (P<0.05). The 5-year OS rate in 27 patients with regular consolidation chemotherapy was significantly higher than 13 patients with irregular chemotherapy after CRz [(47.5 +/- 17.1)% vs (38.9 +/- 17.3)%; P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood t(8;21)/AML1-ETO-positive AML is a highly heterogeneous disease, with a high CR rate and a good long-term prognosis. Age is one of the important factors affecting the long-term therapeutic effect. Regular consolidation chemotherapy applied after CR usually is helpful.","['Wu, Jun', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wang, Bin', 'Cheng, Yi-Fei', 'Liu, Gui-Lan']","['Wu J', 'Zhang LP', 'Lu AD', 'Wang B', 'Cheng YF', 'Liu GL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2011)12-0931-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;13(12):931-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Myrtaceae) have often been indicated by epidemiological studies on populations in which these fruits are consumed daily. However, complete characterization of the active principles responsible for this ability has never been performed. Here, we have characterized P. guajava's anti-cancer potential and identified the parts of the fruit involved in its anti-neoplastic action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied morphology of our cells, cell cycle characteristics and apoptosis and performed immunostaining, differentiation and western blot analyses. RESULTS: We report that the P. guajava extract exerted anti-cancer control on both haematological and solid neoplasias. P. guajava extract's anti-tumour properties were found to be tightly bound to induction of apoptosis and differentiation. Use of ex vivo myeloid leukaemia blasts corroborated that P. guajava was able to induce cell death but did not exhibit anti-cancer effects on all malignant cells investigated, indicating selective activity against certain types of tumour. Analyses of P. guajava pulp, peel and seeds identified the pulp as being the most relevant component for causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, whereas peel was responsible for causing cell differentiation. P. guajava itself and its pulp-derived extract were found to induce apoptosis accompanied by caspase activation and p16, p21, Fas ligand (FASL TNF super-family, member 6), Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and tumour necrosis factor receptor super-family, member 10b (DR5), overexpression.

However, it was demonstrated that BCL2 inhibitors enhanced the clinical efficacy of chemo and immunotherapeutics. Lenalidomide, an immunomodulator, is clinically effective in CLL and can enhance the anti-CLL effects of CD20 targeting monoclonal antibody, rituximab. Here, we investigated the mechanism of immune-directed killing of lenalidomide in CLL and evaluated if concurrent targeting of CD20 and BCL2 can enhance this effect. In vitro treatment with lenalidomide enhanced the antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) directed by rituximab in autologous leukaemic cells. Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients after treatment with lenalidomide and rituximab showed increased ADCC in vitro versus control (pre-treatment sample). This effect was further enhanced with pre-treatment of tumour cells with AT-101 (a BH3 mimetic that functions as BCL2 antagonist). Our data suggest that AT-101 in combination with lenalidomide can potentially be an effective therapeutic regimen for CLL.","['Masood, Aisha', 'Chitta, Kasyapa', 'Paulus, Aneel', 'Khan, A Nazmul H', 'Sher, Taimur', 'Ersing, Noreen', 'Miller, Kena C', 'Manfredi, Deborah', 'Ailawadhi, Sikander', 'Borrelo, Ivan', 'Lee, Kelvin P', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher']","['Masood A', 'Chitta K', 'Paulus A', 'Khan AN', 'Sher T', 'Ersing N', 'Miller KC', 'Manfredi D', 'Ailawadhi S', 'Borrelo I', 'Lee KP', 'Chanan-Khan A']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Rituximab', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/12/17 06:00,2013/03/26 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08984.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Apr;157(1):59-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08984.x.

Here, we present the largest study of prognostic markers ever carried out in Binet stage A patients (n = 1154) with a median follow-up of 8 years. We assessed the prognostic impact of lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), immunoglobulin gene (IGHV) mutation status, CD38 expression, ZAP-70 expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics with regards to time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis revealed LDT as the most prognostic parameter for TTFT, with IGHV mutation status most prognostic for OS. CD38 expression, ZAP-70 expression and FISH were also prognostic variables; combinations of these markers increased prognostic power in concordant cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that only LDT, IGHV mutation status, CD38 and age at diagnosis were independent prognostic variables for TTFT and OS. Therefore, IGHV mutation status and CD38 expression have independent prognostic value in early stage CLL and should be performed as part of the routine diagnostic workup. ZAP-70 expression and FISH were not independent prognostic markers in early stage disease and can be omitted at diagnosis but FISH analysis should be undertaken at disease progression to direct treatment strategy.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Hewamana, Saman', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Gesk, Stefan', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Wagner, Simon', 'Kennedy, Ben', 'Miall, Fiona', 'Davis, Zadie A', 'Tracy, Ian', 'Gardiner, Anne C', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Oscier, David', 'Fegan, Chris']","['Pepper C', 'Majid A', 'Lin TT', 'Hewamana S', 'Pratt G', 'Walewska R', 'Gesk S', 'Siebert R', 'Wagner S', 'Kennedy B', 'Miall F', 'Davis ZA', 'Tracy I', 'Gardiner AC', 'Brennan P', 'Hills RK', 'Dyer MJ', 'Oscier D', 'Fegan C']","['School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111215,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08974.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Feb;156(4):499-507. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08974.x.

Little information exists on differences between population and hospital controls in case-control studies on cancers in Chinese hospital setting. METHODS: We conducted three parallel case-control studies on leukemia, breast and colorectal cancers in China between 2009 and 2010, using population and hospital controls to separately match 540 incident cases by age, gender and residency at a 1:1 ratio. Demographic and lifestyle factors were measured using a validated questionnaire in face-to-face interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The two control groups had closely similar exposure distributions of 15 out of 16 factors, with the only exception being that hospital controls were less likely to have a BMI >/= 25 (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.93). For exposure of green tea drinking, the adjusted ORs (95% CIs) comparing green tealeaves intake >/= 1000 grams annually with non-drinkers were 0.51 (0.31, 0.83) and 0.21 (0.27, 0.74) for three cancers combined, 0.06 (0.01, 0.61) and 0.07 (0.01, 0.47) for breast cancer, 0.52 (0.29, 0.94) and 0.45 (0.25, 0.82) for colorectal cancer, 0.65 (0.08, 5.63) and 0.57 (0.07, 4.79) for leukemia using hospital and population controls respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that hospital controls were comparable with population controls for most demographic characteristics and lifestyle factors measured, but there was a slight difference between the two control groups. Hospital outpatients provide a satisfactory control group in hospital-based case-control study in the Chinese hospital setting.","['Li, Lin', 'Zhang, Min', ""Holman, D'Arcy""]","['Li L', 'Zhang M', 'Holman D']","['School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,['0 (Tea)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Asians/statistics & numerical data', 'Breast Neoplasms/ethnology/*prevention & control', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/ethnology/*prevention & control', 'Drinking', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia/ethnology/*prevention & control', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tea']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/03/29 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-11-167 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-11-167 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2011 Dec 15;11:167. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-11-167.,,PMC3261130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its relevance and incidence are probably influenced by the conditioning regimen and incorporation of T-cell depletion. The presence of recipient chimerism levels >40-50% following T-cell replete reduced intensity transplantation correlates with a high risk of graft rejection, regardless of donor-lymphocyte infusions, but it is unclear whether this finding translates to T-cell depleted transplants. We conducted a retrospective single-institution analysis of patients receiving alemtuzumab-based HSCT. 27/152 (18%) evaluable cases had predominantly recipient T-cell chimerism at 3 months or beyond. By contrast, coincident chimerism in the granulocyte lineage was predominantly of donor origin (median 100%) in all but one patient. Donor lymphocyte infusion effectively converted predominantly recipient T-cell chimerism to ful donor chimerism in all evaluable cases including three cases with no detectable donor T cells. The only graft failure occurred in the patient with predominantly recipient myeloid chimerism in whom rejection occurred rapidly before donor lymphocytes could be administered. We conclude that predominant or complete recipient T-cell chimerism following alemtuzumab-based regimens does not have the same clinical implications as that following T-cell replete transplants and can be effectively converted with donor lymphocytes without the need for lympho-depleting agents or re-conditioning.","['Mohamedbhai, Sajir G', 'Edwards, Noha', 'Morris, Emma C', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Thomson, Kirsty J', 'Peggs, Karl S']","['Mohamedbhai SG', 'Edwards N', 'Morris EC', 'Mackinnon S', 'Thomson KJ', 'Peggs KS']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08944.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Feb;156(4):516-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08944.x.

Early clinical data on asparagine- and arginine-depleting drugs have demonstrated low toxicity and efficacy in melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methionine auxotrophy is a novel niche currently under exploration for targeting certain cancers. AREAS COVERED: In this review we explore the discovery of methionine auxotrophy followed by in vitro, in vivo and patient data on targeting cancer with methionine depletion. We end with a small discussion on bioengineering, pegylation and red blood cell encapsulation as mechanisms for decreasing immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs. We hope to provide a platform for future pharmacology, toxicology and cytotoxicity studies with methionine depletion therapy and drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Although methionine auxotrophy seems as a viable target, extensive research addressing normal versus cancer cell toxicity needs to be conducted. Further research also needs to be conducted into the molecular mechanism associated with methionine depletion therapy. Finally, novel methods need to be developed to decrease the immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs, a current issue with protein therapeutics.","['Agrawal, Vaidehi', 'Alpini, Sarah E J', 'Stone, Everett M', 'Frenkel, Eugene P', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Agrawal V', 'Alpini SE', 'Stone EM', 'Frenkel EP', 'Frankel AE']","['Scott & White Cancer Research Institute, Scott & White Hospital, Department of Medicine, 5701 South Airport Road, Temple, Texas 76502, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111105,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bioengineering/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Methionine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/diet therapy/*drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Pseudomonas putida/metabolism', 'Rats']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/04/19 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2012.636349 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2012 Jan;12(1):53-61. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2012.636349.

Recent data indicated that gamma delta+ T cells might participate in mediating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, whether G-CSF could influence the T cell receptors (TCR) of gamma delta+ T cells (TRGV and TRDV repertoire) remains unclear. To further characterize this feature, we compared the distribution and clonality of TRGV and TRDV repertoire of T cells before and after G-CSF mobilization and investigated the association between the changes of TCR repertoire and GVHD in patients undergoing G-CSF mobilized allo-PBSCT. METHODS: The complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sizes of three TRGV and eight TRDV subfamily genes were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 donors before and after G-CSF mobilization, using RT-PCR and genescan technique. To determine the expression levels of TRGV subfamily genes, we performed quantitative analysis of TRGVI~III subfamilies by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expression levels of three TRGV subfamilies were significantly decreased after G-CSF mobilization (P = 0.015, 0.009 and 0.006, respectively). The pattern of TRGV subfamily expression levels was TRGVII >TRGV I >TRGV III before mobilization, and changed to TRGV I >TRGV II >TRGV III after G-CSF mobilization. The expression frequencies of TRGV and TRDV subfamilies changed at different levels after G-CSF mobilization. Most TRGV and TRDV subfamilies revealed polyclonality from pre-G-CSF-mobilized and G-CSF-mobilized samples. Oligoclonality was detected in TRGV and TRDV subfamilies in 3 donors before mobilization and in another 4 donors after G-CSF mobilization, distributed in TRGVII, TRDV1, TRDV3 and TRDV6, respectively. Signi fi cant positive association was observed between the invariable clonality of TRDV1 gene repertoire after G-CSF mobilization and low incidence of GVHD in recipients (P = 0.015, OR = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF mobilization not only influences the distribution and expression levels of TRGV and TRDV repertoire, but also changes the clonality of gamma delta+ T cells. This alteration of TRGV and TRDV repertoire might play a role in mediating GVHD in G-CSF mobilized allo-PBSCT.","['Xuan, Li', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Fan, Zhiping', 'Ling, Yiwen', 'Huang, Fen', 'Zhang, Fuhua', 'Zhai, Xiao', 'Liu, Qifa']","['Xuan L', 'Wu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan Z', 'Ling Y', 'Huang F', 'Zhang F', 'Zhai X', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/17 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/12/17 06:00'],"['2011/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-9-215 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-9-215 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2011 Dec 15;9:215. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-9-215.,,PMC3261127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such example is on class prediction with high-dimension, low-sample size data. Due to the small sample size, the sample mean estimates are usually unreliable. As a consequence, the performance of the class prediction methods using the sample mean may also be unsatisfactory. To obtain more accurate estimation of parameters some statistical methods, such as regularizations through shrinkage, are often desired. RESULTS: In this article, we investigate the family of shrinkage estimators for the mean value under the quadratic loss function.

Some Carnivorans may harbor comparatively fewer impediments. For example, in contrast to mice, the domestic cat genome encodes essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors. All Feliformia species and at least one Caniformia species also lack a major lentiviral restriction mechanism (TRIM5alpha/TRIMCyp proteins). Here we investigated cells from two species in another carnivore family, the Mustelidae, for permissiveness to the HIV-1 life cycle. Mustela putorius furo (domesticated ferret) primary cells and cell lines did not restrict HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), or N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) postentry and supported late HIV-1 life cycle steps comparably to human cells. The ferret TRIM5alpha gene exon 8, which encodes the B30.2 domain, was found to be pseudogenized. Strikingly, ferret (but not mink) cells engineered to express human HIV-1 entry receptors supported productive spreading replication, amplification, and serial passage of wild-type HIV-1. Nevertheless, produced virions had relatively reduced infectivity and the virus accrued G-->A hypermutations, consistent with APOBEC3 protein pressure. Ferret cell-passaged HIV-1 also evolved amino acid changes in the capsid cyclophilin A binding loop. We conclude that the genome of this carnivore can provide essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors and that ferret APOBEC3 proteins with activity against HIV-1 are likely. Even so, unlike in cat cells, HIV-1 can replicate in ferret cells without vif substitution. The virus evolves in this novel nonprimate cell adaptive landscape. We suggest that further characterization of HIV-1 adaptation in ferret cells and delineation of Mustelidae restriction factor repertoires are warranted, with a view to the potential for an HIV-1 animal model.","['Fadel, Hind J', 'Saenz, Dyana T', 'Guevara, Rebekah', 'von Messling, Veronika', 'Peretz, Mary', 'Poeschla, Eric M']","['Fadel HJ', 'Saenz DT', 'Guevara R', 'von Messling V', 'Peretz M', 'Poeschla EM']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Cell Line', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Ferrets', 'HIV Infections/*virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mink', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06035-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06035-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(4):2312-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06035-11.

We generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Jurkat T cells and selected several IgM MAbs that strongly inhibited HTLV-1 but not human immune deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cell-to-cell infection. These MAbs recognized the so-called Tn antigen (GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr) that arises on Jurkat cells from a mutation in the T-synthase-specific chaperone Cosmc and the consequent loss of O-glycan elongation. Anti-Tn MAbs precipitated two major O-glycan carrier proteins, CD43 and CD45, and caused a strong aggregation of Jurkat cells. The restoration of O-glycosylation in Jurkat cells by stably transducing the wild-type Cosmc gene resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in the level of surface expression of CD43 and enhanced HTLV-1 transmission 10-fold in comparison to that of parental cells. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of CD43 or CD45 expression in Jurkat-Cosmc, HBP-ALL, and CEM T cells decreased HTLV-1 infection severalfold. The knockdown of CD45 in Jurkat cells severely reduced both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 infections, but Cosmc coexpression partially rescued infection. HTLV-1 proteins, which assembled in small patches on Jurkat cells, formed large clusters on the surface of Jurkat-Cosmc cells. These data indicate that large aggregates of HTLV-1 assemblies are more infectious than multiple clustered virions. We suggest that heavily O-glycosylated CD43 and CD45 molecules render cells less adhesive, prevent inappropriate cell-cell contacts, and favor the assembly of HTLV-1 particles into large, highly infectious structures on the surface of T cells.","['Mazurov, Dmitriy', 'Ilinskaya, Anna', 'Heidecker, Gisela', 'Filatov, Alexander']","['Mazurov D', 'Ilinskaya A', 'Heidecker G', 'Filatov A']","['Laboratory of Immunochemistry, Institute of Immunology, Moscow, Russia. dvmazurov@yandex.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Leukosialin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression', 'Glycosylation', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukosialin/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06993-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06993-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(5):2447-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06993-11.

It involves the treatment of the whole body using a large radiation field with extended source-skin distance. Therefore, it is important to measure and monitor the skin dose during the treatment. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and the OneDose() metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors are used during treatment delivery to measure the radiation dose and compare it with the target prescribed dose. AIMS: The primary goal of this study was to measure the variation of skin dose using OneDose MOSFET detectors and TLD detectors, and compare the results with the target prescribed dose. The secondary aim was to evaluate the simplicity of use and determine if one system was superior to the other in clinical use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The measurements involved twelve adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. TLD and OneDose MOSFET dosimetry were performed at ten different anatomical sites of each patient. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a variation between skin dose measured with OneDose MOSFET detectors and TLD in all patients. However, the variation was not significant. Furthermore, the results showed for every anatomical site there was no significant different between the prescribed dose and the dose measured by either TLD or OneDose MOSFET detectors. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences between the OneDose MOSFET and TLDs in comparison to the target prescribed dose. However, OneDose MOSFET detectors give a direct read-out immediately after the treatment, and their simplicity of use to compare with TLD detectors may make them preferred for clinical use.","['Al-Mohammed, Huda Ibrahim']",['Al-Mohammed HI'],"['King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Dept of Biomedical Physics, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,N Am J Med Sci,North American journal of medical sciences,101521411,,,,2011/12/16 06:00,2011/12/16 06:01,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4297/najms.2011.3362 [doi]', 'NAJMS-3-362 [pii]']",ppublish,N Am J Med Sci. 2011 Aug;3(8):362-6. doi: 10.4297/najms.2011.3362.,,PMC3234142,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'MOSFET', 'Skin Dose', 'TLD', 'Total Body Irradiation']",,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCE: A literature search of the PubMed database (1972-October 2011) using the search terms clofarabine and acute myeloid leukemia was performed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant English-language articles were reviewed, and clinical trials with patients aged 50 years or older who were newly diagnosed with AML were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two studies evaluating clofarabine as monotherapy and 2 studies evaluating clofarabine in combination with cytarabine were reviewed. Clofarabine demonstrated activity in older adults with previously untreated AML. Response rates and median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving clofarabine were similar to those reported for conventional intensive chemotherapy regimens. Responses to the 2 types of treatment remained similar in the presence of unfavorable prognostic factors, such as secondary AML or adverse cytogenetics. Although clofarabine was associated with a lower induction mortality rate versus intensive chemotherapy regimens, a significant percentage of patients experienced severe complications, including sepsis. Compared to single-agent clofarabine, response rates and median OS were higher for clofarabine combined with cytarabine. CONCLUSIONS: Based on published data, adverse effect profiles, and cost, clofarabine may be an appropriate alternative to intensive chemotherapy regimens in certain subsets of older patients with newly diagnosed AML. These include patients with a baseline decreased performance status or history of cardiovascular disease who may not tolerate anthracyclines, which are typically a component of most intensive chemotherapy regimens. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to directly compare the efficacy of clofarabine with that of intensive chemotherapy regimens and to evaluate the potential benefit of combining clofarabine with cytarabine.","['Tran, Huyentran', 'Yang, Daisy']","['Tran H', 'Yang D']","['Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111213,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clofarabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1Q295 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1Q295 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2012 Jan;46(1):89-96. doi: 10.1345/aph.1Q295.

In this study, we fractionated HWEA to 4 fractions using stepwise gradient column chromatography with water and ethanol, and demonstrated the effects of each fraction on antigen (Ag)-stimulated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The 40% ethanol eluate extract (EtEx.40) showed the strongest inhibition level of these fractions. To reveal the inhibitory mechanisms underlying degranulation by EtEx.40, we investigated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, intracellular free Ca(2)(+) concentration ([Ca(2)(+)]i), and early intracellular signaling pathways. Treatment with EtEx.40 markedly inactivated Lyn following Ag stimulation, resulting in the suppressions of intracellular elevation of [Ca(2)(+)]i and production of ROS. To identify the active compound in EtEx.40, we isolated 7 flavonoids from EtEx.40 and calculated their inhibition levels on Ag-stimulated degranulation. These flavonoids inhibited degranulation by about 25-60%. We further examined the in vivo effects of HWEA or EtEx.40 using a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction. Both extracts strongly suppressed the PCA reaction.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine BK(Ca) channel expression in human endometrium and its role in endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. METHODS: BK(Ca) channel expression in human endometrium is described at different phases of the menstrual cycle using quantitative real time-PCR and Western blot techniques. Their effects on embryo implantation were examined using JAr spheroid attachment assays and in vivo mouse model. We examined their effects on endometrial receptivity factors, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity using quantitative real time-PCR, Western blot, and EMSA analyses. Changes in electrophysiological properties and cytosolic free Ca(2+) were measured in endometrial cells with or without specific BK(Ca) blocker or transfected with BK(Ca) small interfering RNA using patch-clamp and fluorescence analyses, respectively. RESULTS: BK(Ca) channels are expressed in human endometrial cells in a phase-related fashion during the menstrual cycle (proliferative, 0.20 +/- 0.02, vs. mid-secretory, 0.72 +/- 0.07; P < 0.01). Blocking BK(Ca) channel function or knockdown of endogenous BK(Ca) channel expression not only decreased JAr spheroid attachment rate and embryo implantation rate in mice but also significantly reduced the expression levels of endometrial receptive factors, including leukemia inhibitory factor, integrin beta3, claudin-4, and DKK-1, in human endometrial cells. Blocking BK(Ca) channels also reduced BK(Ca)-regulated NF-kappaB activity, cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, and membrane potentials in human endometrial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that BK(Ca) channels: 1) are expressed in endometrial cells; 2) affect embryo implantation by mediating endometrial receptive factors; and 3) alter the activity of NF-kappaB and homeostasis of Ca(2+) in the human endometrial cells.","['Zhang, Run-Ju', 'Zou, Li-Bo', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Tan, Ya-Jing', 'Wang, Ting-Ting', 'Liu, Ai-Xia', 'Qu, Fan', 'Meng, Ye', 'Ding, Guo-Lian', 'Lu, Yong-Chao', 'Lv, Ping-Ping', 'Sheng, Jian-Zhong', 'Huang, He-Feng']","['Zhang RJ', 'Zou LB', 'Zhang D', 'Tan YJ', 'Wang TT', 'Liu AX', 'Qu F', 'Meng Y', 'Ding GL', 'Lu YC', 'Lv PP', 'Sheng JZ', 'Huang HF']","[""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Ministry of Education, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo Implantation/*genetics/physiology', 'Endometrium/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Menstrual Cycle/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2011-2108 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2011-2108 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2012 Feb;97(2):543-53. doi: 10.1210/jc.2011-2108.

Mother-to-infant transmission via breast milk is an important route of infection, and establishing programs to prevent such transmission requires exact figures on the HTLV-1 prevalence rate and the number of carriers. Therefore, the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 among 1,196,321 Japanese first-time blood donors from 2006 to 2007 was investigated. A total of 3,787 of such donors were confirmed to be positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody. By applying a fitness curve to the age ranges outside the blood donor age range, the present number of HTLV-1 carriers covering ages from 0 to 99 years was estimated to be at least 1.08 million in Japan; this value was 10% lower than that reported in 1988. The adjusted overall prevalence rates were estimated to be 0.66% and 1.02% in men and women, respectively. The peak in carrier numbers was found among individuals in their 70s, which is a shift from the previous peak observed in the 1988 database among individuals in their 50s. Carriers were distributed not only in the endemic southwestern region of Japan, but throughout the country, particularly in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. By applying population projections, it was calculated that the carrier number will decrease by half in the next two decades; however, the carrier population will age over that interval, meaning that the age of patients with adult T-cell leukemia will also be higher.","['Satake, Masahiro', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Tadokoro, Kenji']","['Satake M', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Tadokoro K']","['Central Blood Institute, Japanese Red Cross, Tokyo, Japan. ma-satake@tokyo.bc.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'Carrier State/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Male', '*Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jmv.23181 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2012 Feb;84(2):327-35. doi: 10.1002/jmv.23181.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this transformation is a rare event, once AML has occurred, it is associated with a poor response to therapy and short survival. The molecular events leading to transformation are poorly defined. Currently, no therapy other than allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been demonstrated to alter the natural history of this disease. Multiple therapeutic investigations are currently ongoing, including early ASCT, hypomethylating agents, and JAK2 inhibition, to try to alter the course of the disease and improve outcomes.

Nevertheless, the existence of additional genetic events that modify the MPN phenotype, predate JAK2 mutations, or contribute to leukemic transformation of MPNs was suspected. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to the discovery of mutations in a number of epigenetic modifiers in patients with MPNs, including mutations in TET2, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, and EZH2. In addition to mutation, alterations in the expression or activity of chromatin-modifying/reading proteins PRMT5 and L3MBTL1 have been found to be important in MPN development. Moreover, the JAK2 mutation itself recently has been shown to directly affect histone post-translational modifications.

NVP-BGT226 is a novel dual class PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that has entered Phase I/II clinical trials. We analyzed the effect of NVP-BGT226 (10-100 nM) on the pancreatic cell lines Panc-1, BxPc-3, AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 in regard to cell viability, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle, and expression of the antiapoptotic genes Survivin, MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Cell viability decreased within 24-72 h after exposure to about 50% compared to untreated control cells in a concentration- but not time-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that NVP-BGT226 induced predominantly G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Additionally, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed a remarkable decrease of Survivin expression. Originally designed as a dual inhibitor, there was only a significant inhibition of p-mTOR. In summary, the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BGT226 induces G0/G1 arrest and acts, at least, partially via downregulation of Survivin.","['Glienke, Wolfgang', 'Maute, Luise', 'Wicht, Johannes', 'Bergmann, Lothar']","['Glienke W', 'Maute L', 'Wicht J', 'Bergmann L']","['Medical Clinic II, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, JW Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111215,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0', '(8-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-(4-piperazin-1-yl-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-', '1,3-dihydroimidazo(4,5-c)quinolin-2-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-011-0290-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Jun;33(3):757-65. doi: 10.1007/s13277-011-0290-2.

It has been widely accepted that Lys-48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitination plays a critical role in NF-kappaB signalling by targeting inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), thereby leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Alternatively, studies on IL-1 and TNF signalling have revealed that proteins modified with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains do not undergo the proteasomal degradation, instead, function as the signalling platforms required for the activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. From the studies on lymphoid malignancies, human T cell leukaemia virus 1-derived protein, Tax, has been shown to activate the IKK complex, although the mechanism is largely unknown. Recently, Shibata et al. (Activation of the IkappaB kinase complex by HTLV-1 Tax requires cytosolic factors involved in Tax-induced polyubiquitination. J. Biochem. 150: 679-686, 2011) has established a cell free IKK assay system and demonstrated that recombinant Tax protein can activate the IKK complex in a K63-linked-polyubiquitination-dependent manner. This cell free assay system will be useful for the identification of various key players responsible for Tax-induced IKK activation.","['Hayakawa, Makio']",['Hayakawa M'],"['School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan. hayakawa@ps.toyaku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20111213,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['mvr139 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvr139 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2012 Feb;151(2):115-8. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvr139.

To identify predictive biomarkers, sensitivity to GSK1120212 was profiled for 218 solid tumor cell lines and 81 hematologic malignancy cell lines. For solid tumors, RAF/RAS mutation was a strong predictor of sensitivity. Among RAF/RAS mutant lines, co-occurring PIK3CA/PTEN mutations conferred a cytostatic response instead of a cytotoxic response for colon cancer cells that have the biggest representation of the comutations. Among KRAS mutant cell lines, transcriptomics analysis showed that cell lines with an expression pattern suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were less sensitive to GSK1120212. In addition, a proportion of cell lines from certain tissue types not known to carry frequent RAF/RAS mutations also seemed to be sensitive to GSK1120212. Among these were breast cancer cell lines, with triple negative breast cancer cell lines being more sensitive than cell lines from other breast cancer subtypes. We identified a single gene DUSP6, whose expression was associated with sensitivity to GSK1120212 and lack of expression associated with resistance irrelevant of RAF/RAS status. Among hematologic cell lines, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines were particularly sensitive.

Notch is a family of transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and transcription regulators. As the first human gene of this family, Notch1 was discovered in 1991 through the analysis of the chromosomal translocation t(7;9) (q34;q34.3) observed in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Since then Notch signaling has been implicated in multiple processes that govern normal morphogenesis, differentiation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. At the same time a role of Notch in the pathogenesis of hematologic and solid malignancies has become apparent. The identification of activating mutations in Notch1 were discovered in over 50% of T-ALL patients. However, whether the mutation in Notch1 is an early event or an secondary event is still unknown. It is becoming increasingly evident that Notch signaling can be both oncogenic and tumor suppressive. This review focuses on the recent findings regarding the Notch signaling during the development and progression of different kinds of hematologic malignancies, the types of mutations in Notch1 in T-ALL and the relationship between Notch signaling pathway and other signaling pathways.In addition, the clinical prospects of Notch inhibitors also are discussed.","['Zhao, Yi-Ran', 'Fu, Rong']","['Zhao YR', 'Fu R']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Neoplasms', '*Receptor, Notch1', '*Signal Transduction']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)06-1550-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;19(6):1550-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression level of CXCR4 on CD34(+) cells and apoptosis of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry; the chemotaxis of SDF-1 on bone marrow mononuclear cells in 4 patients with low risk MDS (IPSS score </= 1.0) and 5 patients with high risk MDS (IPSS score >/= 1.5) was assayed by transwell migration test of cells. The effect of SDF-1 on cell adhesion capability was measured by using CCK-8 method. The results indicated that the apoptosis rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in MDS patients with low risk (IPPS score < 1.0) than that in MDS patients with high risk (IPSS score >/= 1.5) (21.55% vs 7.52%, p < 0.001); as well, the apoptosis rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in MDS patients with low risk than that in de novo AML patients (21.55% vs 7.33%, p < 0.001), no relation of CD34(+) cell apoptosis with age and sex of patients was found. SDF-1 could promote the cells of patients with CXCR4 high expression to adhere to the stroma cells, and induce migration of these cells, as well as, SDF-1 could trigger the polarization of the cells which highly expressed CXCR4. After addition of pertussis toxin, wortmannin and AMD3100, the ability of adhersion and migration of the cells with highly expressed CXCR4 decreased, but there was no above-mentioned phenomenon in patients who lowly expressed CXCR4. It is concluded that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis enhances the ability of cell adhesion and migration through PI3K signaling pathway, thereby plays antiapoptosis role, moreover the above-mentioned effects can be blocked by PI3K pathway inhibitor and G protein inhibitor.","['Yang, Rui', 'Pu, Jie', 'Guo, Juan', 'Xu, Feng', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Zhao, You-Shan', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Gu, Shu-Cheng', 'Chang, Chun-Kang', 'Li, Xiao']","['Yang R', 'Pu J', 'Guo J', 'Xu F', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhao YS', 'Zhang X', 'Gu SC', 'Chang CK', 'Li X']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)06-1432-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;19(6):1432-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal IgH gene rearrangements in 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis were identified by multiplex PCR assay. PCR products were sequenced and pairwise in IMGT data base. Allele-specific oligonucleotides primers were designed complementary to the junctional region. The conservative JH primers combined with TaqMan probes were used to monitor the level of MRD in ALL patients. The sensitivity and specificity were assessed as well. The results indicated that out of all the 51 ALL patients, IgH rearrangements were identified in 21 cases, and 15 patients out of them were quantified. The slope of the standard curves was -3.1 to -3.9 and the correlation coefficients of all standard curves were > 0.98. The sensitivity was between 10(-4) and 10(-5), only one patient's sensitivity was 10(-3). Most of the quantitative range was less than 10(-4). The background's nonspecific amplification was detectable at a low level and had a little influence on results. 7 patients whose MRD level below 10(-3) kept complete remission and another 8 patients whose MRD level above 10(-3) had a higher relapse rate.

CML stem cells were thought to be the root which could lead disease development and ultimately rapid change. However, a stable animal model for studying the characteristics of CML stem cells is currently lacking. This study was aimed to establish a transplanted human CML nude-mice model to further explore the biological behavior of CML stem cells in vivo, and to enrich CML stem cells in nude mice by series transplantation. The 4 - 6 weeks old BALB/c nude mice pretreated by splenectomy (S), cytoxan intraperitoneal injection (C) and sublethal irradiation (I) were transplanted intravenously with (5 - 7) x 10(7) of bone marrow mononuclear cells from CML patients in chronic phase. Alternatively, 4 - 6 weeks old BALB/c nude mice pretreated by lethal irradiation were transplanted intravenously with 5 x 10(6) homologous bone marrow cells of BALB/c nude mice together with (5 - 7) x 10(7) of bone marrow mononuclear cells from CML patients in chronic phase simultaneously. The leukemic cells engrafted and infiltrated in organs and bone marrow of the mice were tracked by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), plastic-embedded biopsy and flow cytometry. The results of these two methods were compared. The results showed that human CML cells engrafted and infiltrating into the bone marrow of two nude mice pretreated with SCI could be detected. In spite of the low successful rate, results suggested the feasibility of this method by using BALB/c nude mice as a human CML animal model. In contrast, in nude mice pretreated by the lethal dose irradiation, CML cells in the bone marrow could not be found. It is concluded that human bone marrow CML cells can results in leukemia in nude mice pretreated by SCI. Thus this study provides a new strategy for establishment of CML animal models which deserves further elaboration.","['Li, Xian-Min', 'Ding, Xin', 'Zhang, Long-Zhen', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Chen, Zi-Xing']","['Li XM', 'Ding X', 'Zhang LZ', 'Cen JN', 'Chen ZX']","['Suzhou University First Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)06-1378-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;19(6):1378-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the control group, 7 males and 5 females, aged from 16 to 78 years old with the median age of 46. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the levels of CYR61, CTGF, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 mRNA. The results showed that the levels of CYR61, CTGF, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 mRNA in BM of newly diagnosed patients with acute and chronic leukemia of each group were significantly higher as compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The levels of CYR61, CTGF mRNA in acute leukemia remission group were significantly higher than those in control group (p = 0.039, 0.025).

The transcript of SET-NUP214 fusion gene was detected by RT-nested PCR. The pattern of Ig/TR gene rearrangement was analyzed by using the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR assays. Allelic-specific primers were designed for further monitoring the minimal residual disease (MRD). The results indicated that the fusion site located between exon 7 of SET and exon 18 of NUP214 at mRNA level in the three patients. The diagnoses were made as the mixed phenotype of acute leukemia (MPAL) for patients 1, acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) for patients 2, and stage IV T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) for patients 3, respectively. Patient 1 responded to chemotherapy very poorly and relapsed at month 6 after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patient 2 had high MRD (> 10(-2)) at the end of inducing remission therapy (day 33) which implied poor outcome, and died of toxic epidermal necrolysis and sequent serious infection. Patient 3 achieved hematological complete remission (CR) and MRD negative at day 15 and day 33 respectively. The duration of CR lasted for 30 months. Clonal TR gene rearrangements were detected in all the three patients. The rearrangements of TRD, TRG and TRB were found in patient 1 and 3. The rearrangements of TRD, TRB, IgH and IgK Kde were detected in patient 2. All the 6 TRB rearrangements detected were incomplete rearrangements, whereas 85.7% and 14.3% of the TRD, and TRG rearrangements were complete and incomplete, respectively. It is concluded that the transformation of SET-NUP214(+) leukemia/lymphoma cells may occur after the rearrangements of TRD and TRG and shortly after TRB rearrangement.

Consequently, nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells and block tumor growth in mice. Thus, we show that imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib drive paradoxical RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation and have uncovered a synthetic lethal interaction that can be used to kill drug-resistant CML cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Packer, Leisl M', 'Rana, Sareena', 'Hayward, Robert', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Rebocho, Ana', 'Heidorn, Sonja', 'Zabriskie, Matthew S', 'Niculescu-Duvaz, Ion', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Springer, Caroline', 'Marais, Richard']","['Packer LM', 'Rana S', 'Hayward R', ""O'Hare T"", 'Eide CA', 'Rebocho A', 'Heidorn S', 'Zabriskie MS', 'Niculescu-Duvaz I', 'Druker BJ', 'Springer C', 'Marais R']","['Division of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Cancer Research, 237 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(11)00410-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2011 Dec 13;20(6):715-27. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.004.,"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', '096444/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '11566/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'R37 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3951999,,['NIHMS559042'],,,"['Nat Rev Cancer. 2012 Feb;12(2):82-3.

Using an antibody characterized extensively by us, Lillvis et al. report detecting HOXA4 at a size of 33 kDa despite our previous reports that HOXA4 is detected at ~37-39 kDa and that the ~30-33 kDa band is non-specific. Using small interfering RNA targeting HOXA4, forced expression of full-length HOXA4 and HOXA4-positive and -negative ovarian cancer cell lines, we confirm our previous findings that the ~30-33 kDa band is non-specific and that HOXA4 is detected at ~37-39 kDa. Moreover, we demonstrate that HOXA4 small interfering RNA reduces the ~37-39 kDa HOXA4 band, but not the ~30-33 kDa non-specific band, in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line used by Lillvis et al. Western blot analysis performed with two additional commercially available HOXA4 antibodies also detected HOXA4 at ~37-39 kDa. Lastly, immunofluorescent staining of a HOXA4-negative ovarian cancer cell line with the antibody used by Lillvis et al. yields strong perinuclear staining, similar to that observed by Lillvis et al., which cannot be attributed to HOXA4.

MIF is implicated in several acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. MIF's promoter region has functional single nucleotide polymorphisms that controls MIF expression and protein levels. Since increased plasma MIF levels are associated with cancer, studies have examined the association between Mif promoter polymorphisms and cancer. This study is a meta-analysis of the available studies on such an association. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies were included in this meta-analysis to include 1116 cases (cancer patients) and 1728 controls (no cancer). Carrying any C allele in the Mif -173 G/C promoter polymorphism resulted in a significantly greater risk for developing cancer [OR = 1.89 (1.15-3.11), p = 0.012)] when compared to the (G/G) genotype. Subgroup analysis revealed that this association was significant only for ""solid"" tumors (including gastric and prostate cancers) [OR = 2.67 (1.26-5.65), p = 0.010] but not for ""non-solid"" tumors (leukemia) [OR = 1.21 (0.95-1.55), p = 0.122]. Furthermore, when only prostate tumor studies were included in the analysis, the association became even stronger [OR = 3.72 (2.55-5.41), p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis suggests there is an association between any C allele in the Mif -173 G/C promoter polymorphism and an increased risk of cancer, particularly for solid tumors. The association appeared stronger for prostate cancer, specifically. Future studies that include different types of cancers are needed to support and extend these observations.","['Vera, Pedro L', 'Meyer-Siegler, Katherine L']","['Vera PL', 'Meyer-Siegler KL']","['The Bay Pines VA Healthcare System, Research & Development, Bay Pines, Florida, USA. pvera@health.usf.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111011,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,,,2011/12/16 06:00,2011/12/16 06:01,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0500-4-395 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-4-395 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2011 Oct 11;4:395. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-4-395.,,PMC3238298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the members of this family, JAK2, plays a very important role in metabolizing carcinogens and medications. This study aimed to detect whether any association exists between genetic polymorphisms in JAK2 gene and individual susceptibility to acute leukemia. METHODS: A case-control study in a Chinese population with 260 acute leukemia cases and 280 healthy controls matched by age, gender, and ethnicity. Genomic DNA was assayed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) with five genetic polymorphisms in JAK2 gene. RESULTS: The distributions of rs56118985 GA genotype in the acute leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) groups were both slightly different when compared with the control group (P = 0.049 and P = 0.045). The frequencies of rs2230724 AA and GA genotypes in the acute leukemia and its subtypes were all significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.001). This suggested that subjects with A allele of rs2230724 were susceptible to acute leukemia and its subtypes. In addition, A allele of rs2230724 should be an important genetic determinant for acute leukemia and AML. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the risk of acute leukemia might be associated with JAK2 polymorphisms.","['Zhong, Y', 'Wu, J', 'Ma, R', 'Cao, H', 'Wang, Z', 'Ding, J', 'Cheng, L', 'Feng, J', 'Chen, B']","['Zhong Y', 'Wu J', 'Ma R', 'Cao H', 'Wang Z', 'Ding J', 'Cheng L', 'Feng J', 'Chen B']","['Jiangsu Cancer Hospital and Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/11/10 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01386.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Jun;34(3):248-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01386.x.

This allows to eliminate acute leukemias, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, myelomas and MGUS. To date, the risk of transmission of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) disease is only evaluated by the clinical evaluation and CBC. We report here the case of a CLL-type MBL disease occurring in a 12-year-old boy after unrelated BMT. Deep biological investigations, as Immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular biology allow us to determine the donor origin of the CLL clone. In 2010, 14.2% donor (105/737) for unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were over 45y. It is currently estimated (USA) that 1 in 210 men and women will be diagnosed with CLL during their lifetime. Given the long asymptomatic phase of CLL, this raises the case for a detection strategy analog to that used for MGUS and myeloma through serum protein electrophoresis. This case-report, to our knowledge, of a CLL-type MBL unrelated donor-to-recipient transmission through BMT raises ethical and practical questions, such as the proper information about disease transmission risk. The cost-effectiveness of a systematic peripheral blood Immunophenotyping in donors elder than 40y at time of stem cell donation should be evaluated.","['Ferrand, Christophe', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Collonge-Rame, Marie Agnes', 'Larosa, Fabrice', 'Blanc, Michel', 'Behar, Catherine', 'Giannoli, Catherine', 'Garnier, Frederico', 'Tiberghien, Pierre', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Rohrlich, Pierre Simon']","['Ferrand C', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Larosa F', 'Blanc M', 'Behar C', 'Giannoli C', 'Garnier F', 'Tiberghien P', 'Deconinck E', 'Rohrlich PS']","['INSERM UMR645, IFR133, Etablissement Francais du sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France. christophe.ferrand@efs.sante.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120110,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/*standards', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphocytosis/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Quality Control', '*Unrelated Donors']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01741.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Mar;88(3):269-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01741.x.

Identifying key cellular factors controlling invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells should pave the way to new therapeutic strategies efficiently interfering with the metastatic process. PAX2 (paired box 2) transcription factor is expressed by breast cancer cells in vivo and recently, it was shown to negatively regulate the expression of ERBB2 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, HER-2/neu), a well-documented pro-invasive and pro-metastastic gene, in luminal/ERalpha-positive (ERalpha+) breast cancer cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate a putative role for PAX2 in the control of luminal breast cancer cells invasion, and to begin to characterize its regulation. RESULTS: PAX2 activity was higher in cell lines from luminal compared to non-luminal subtype, and activation of PAX2 by estradiol was selectively achieved in breast cancer cell lines of the luminal subtype. This process was blocked by ICI 182780 and could be antagonized by IGF-1. Knockdown of PAX2 in luminal MCF-7 cells completely abrogated estradiol-induced downregulation of ERBB2 and decrease of cell invasion, whereas overexpression of PAX2 in these cells enhanced estradiol effects on ERBB2 levels and cell invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that PAX2 activation by estradiol is selectively achieved in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype, via ERalpha, and identifies IGF-1 as a negative regulator of PAX2 activity in these cells. Further, it reveals a new role for PAX2 in the maintenance of a low invasive behavior in luminal breast cancer cells upon exposure to estradiol, and shows that overexpression and activation of PAX2 in these cells is sufficient to reduce their invasive ability.","['Beauchemin, David', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Van Themsche, Celine']","['Beauchemin D', 'Lacombe C', 'Van Themsche C']","['Research Group in Molecular Oncology and Endocrinology, Department of Chemistry and Biology, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, G9A 5H7 Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Estrogens/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant', 'Humans', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Transfection']",2011/12/16 06:00,2013/02/09 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-148 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-148 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Dec 14;10:148. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-148.,,PMC3264528,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multicenter LRF CLL4 trial, in which 777 patients were randomized to receive chlorambucil or fludarabine, alone or with cyclophosphamide (FC), assessed HRQoL at baseline, months 3, 6 and 12, then annually until 5 years, using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). While on treatment, some HRQoL impairment was seen in patients receiving fludarabine, particularly FC, compared with chlorambucil. Thus at 3 months, role/social functioning and fatigue were >/= 10 points worse than baseline in 41%/46%/56%, respectively, of patients receiving fludarabine alone and 48%/54%/60% receiving FC, compared with only 29%/31%/40% of those receiving chlorambucil. Thereafter HRQoL appeared similar between treatment groups. Sustained remissions were associated with long-term HRQoL benefit. In the primary HRQoL domains patients still in complete or partial remission at each time-point had scores close to those reported in general population studies, while patients whose disease had progressed had mean scores up to 22 points worse, in spite of subsequent treatments. These data offer support for the use of primary treatment regimens likely to achieve and sustain remission in otherwise medically fit patients of all ages, including those aged > 70 years.","['Else, Monica', 'Cocks, Kim', 'Crofts, Shirley', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Richards, Sue M', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Smith, Alastair G']","['Else M', 'Cocks K', 'Crofts S', 'Wade R', 'Richards SM', 'Catovsky D', 'Smith AG']","['Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120301,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alopecia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', '*Quality of Life', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.649479 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1289-98. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.649479.

Because continuous and adequate dosing is important to achieve this outcome, it is important to understand treatment adherence as part of managing long-term CML therapy. While studies regarding imatinib suggest that adherence varies widely, data addressing adherence to newer breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) are sparse. This study evaluates real-world adherence in patients diagnosed with CML receiving dasatinib or nilotinib as second-line therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD(SM)), patients with >/=1 International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition/revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for CML (205.1x ) and >/=1 prescription for imatinib from January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2010 were identified. Analysis was limited to patients who switched to second-line dasatinib or nilotinib. Dasatinib exposure was stratified by dose (</=100 mg/day or >/=140 mg/day) to account for dasatinib label changes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication possession ratio (MPR) was used to calculate adherence and Cox proportional hazard models were used to quantify poor rates of adherence (i.e., MPR <85%). RESULTS: Of 2064 imatinib-exposed patients, 197 received dasatinib (</=100 mg/day, n = 112; >/=140 mg/day, n = 85) and 53 received nilotinib (400 mg BID, n = 46; 400 mg QD, n = 7) as second-line therapy. Mean exposure durations were 276 days for dasatinib (</=100 mg, 275 days; >/=140 mg, 276 days) and 170 days for nilotinib. Cox proportional hazard models quantifying rates of poor adherence (MPR < 85%) comparing nilotinib with dasatinib (adjusted for age, sex, duration of previous imatinib exposure, number of concomitant medications, presence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes) calculated hazard ratios of 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.4) for nilotinib versus dasatinib overall, 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for nilotinib versus dasatinib </=100 mg, and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.0) for nilotinib versus dasatinib >/=140 mg. CONCLUSIONS: While this study is limited by use of claims data to identify CML and adherence, claims based data have been widely used to evaluate the association between treatment use and clinical outcomes. When stratified by dose, patients receiving second-line nilotinib were almost two times more likely to have poor adherence compared with patients receiving second-line dasatinib at the current approved dose of 100 mg once daily.","['Yood, Marianne Ulcickas', 'Oliveria, Susan A', 'Cziraky, Mark', 'Hirji, Ishan', 'Hamdan, Muhammad', 'Davis, Catherine']","['Yood MU', 'Oliveria SA', 'Cziraky M', 'Hirji I', 'Hamdan M', 'Davis C']","['EpiSource, LLC, Newton, MA, USA. muyood@muyood.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120109,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2011.649849 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2012 Feb;28(2):213-9. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2011.649849.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on Jurkat and U937, two leukaemia-derived cell lines. Apoptosis and impairment of cell cycle progression were evaluated by flow cytometry and by microscopic analysis. Changes in protein expression and activation were evaluated by western blot analysis. Coronopilin-tubulin covalent adducts were demonstrated by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Coronopilin inhibited (IC(50) </= 20 mum) leukaemia cell population growth, but displayed poor cytotoxicity to normal white blood cells. On Jurkat cells, coronopilin exerted cell population growth inhibition activity, mainly by triggering caspase-dependent apoptosis. Conversely, in U937 cells, coronopilin's primary response was a robust arrest in G(2) /M. Marked increase in mitotic index and presence of activated cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex, phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10, and hyperpolymerized tubulin indicated that cells accumulated in mitosis. Prolonged mitotic arrest ultimately resulted in U937 mitotic catastrophe, and dying cells exhibited the features of non-caspase-dependent death. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that coronopilin efficiently inhibited leukaemia cell population growth by triggering cell type-specific responses. Moreover, coronopilin-mediated cell population expansion inhibition was specific to neoplastic cells, as normal white blood cell viability was not significantly affected. Thus, coronopilin may represent an interesting new chemical scaffold upon which to develop new anti-leukaemic agents.","['Cotugno, R', 'Fortunato, R', 'Santoro, A', 'Gallotta, D', 'Braca, A', 'De Tommasi, N', 'Belisario, M A']","['Cotugno R', 'Fortunato R', 'Santoro A', 'Gallotta D', 'Braca A', 'De Tommasi N', 'Belisario MA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111214,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Ambrosia/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2011/12/16 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/12/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00796.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2012 Feb;45(1):53-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00796.x.

Among 2815 RIC transplants performed for AML in complete remission (CR) between 1999 and 2008, cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% +/- 1%. Relapsed patients (263) were included into a detailed analysis of risk factors for overall survival (OS) and building of a prognostic score. CR was reinduced in 32%; remission duration after transplantation was the only prognostic factor for response (P = .003). Estimated 2-year OS from relapse was 14%, thereby resembling results of AML relapse after standard conditioning. Among variables available at the time of relapse, remission after HSCT > 5 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.67, P < .001), bone marrow blasts less than 27% (HR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.40-0.72, P < .001), and absence of acute GVHD after HSCT (HR = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.49-0.93, P = .017) were associated with better OS. Based on these factors, 3 prognostic groups could be discriminated, showing OS of 32% +/- 7%, 19% +/- 4%, and 4% +/- 2% at 2 years (P < .0001).

However, it remains unclear whether this is because of inadequate or inconsistent inhibition of target or other complex biology. The mTOR signaling pathway is frequently activated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and we previously showed the safety of combining the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) chemotherapy. However, we did not reliably determine the extent of mTOR inhibition on that study. Here, we sought to develop an assay that allowed us to serially quantify the activation state of mTOR kinase during therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To provide evidence of mTOR kinase activation and inhibition, we applied a validated whole blood fixation/permeabilization technique for flow cytometry to serially monitor S6 ribosomal protein (S6) phosphorylation in immunophenotypically identified AML blasts. RESULTS: With this approach, we show activation of mTOR signaling in 8 of 10 subjects' samples (80%) and conclusively show inhibition of mTOR in the majority of subjects' tumor cell during therapy. Of note, S6 phosphorylation in AML blasts is heterogeneous and, in some cases, intrinsically resistant to rapamycin at clinically achieved concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology described is rapid and reproducible. We show the feasibility of real-time, direct pharmacodynamic monitoring by flow cytometry during clinical trials combining intensive chemotherapy and signal transduction inhibitors. This approach greatly clarifies pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and has broad application to preclinical and clinical testing of drugs whose direct or downstream effects disrupt PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.","['Perl, Alexander E', 'Kasner, Margaret T', 'Shank, Doris', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Perl AE', 'Kasner MT', 'Shank D', 'Luger SM', 'Carroll M']","['Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. alexander.perl@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'MAV protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2346 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2346 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Mar 15;18(6):1716-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2346.

Metastatic colorectal cancer patients are treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy; however, the efficiency is only 10-20% of such patients. An increasing amount of data has demonstrated that response to anti-EGFR therapies is confined to patients with KRAS and BRAF wild type tumors but still some of these patients are non responders to this treatment. The presence of oncogenic deregulation of different members of EGFR downstream signaling or crosstalk molecules could predict the lack of response in these patients. In this study, 40 wild type KRAS and BRAF colorectal tumors were analyzed to elucidate whether PML-RARa bcr1 fusion gene may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Specifically we want to determine if this fusion could be responsible for the inability to respond to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Here, for the first time it is reported, that PML-RARa bcr1 fusion is not responsible for colorectal tumor development and also, this translocation is not predicting the lack of efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies in wild type KRAS and BRAF colorectal cancer patients. These results also suggest that PML-RARa is unlikely to be a promising target for adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer patients.","['Herreros-Villanueva, Marta']",['Herreros-Villanueva M'],"['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital General Yague, Avenida del Cid 96, 09005, Burgos, Spain. herrerosvillanueva.marta@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111214,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PML-RARa bcr1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-011-1337-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2012 May;39(5):5387-91. doi: 10.1007/s11033-011-1337-6.

As benzene also causes hematotoxicity even in workers exposed to levels below the US permissible occupational exposure limit of 1 part per million, further assessment of the health risks associated with its exposure, particularly at low levels, is needed. Here, we describe the probable mechanism by which benzene induces leukemia involving the targeting of critical genes and pathways through the induction of genetic, chromosomal or epigenetic abnormalities and genomic instability, in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC); stromal cell dysregulation; apoptosis of HSCs and stromal cells and altered proliferation and differentiation of HSCs. These effects modulated by benzene-induced oxidative stress, aryl hydrocarbon receptor dysregulation and reduced immunosurveillance, lead to the generation of leukemic stem cells and subsequent clonal evolution to leukemia. A mode of action (MOA) approach to the risk assessment of benzene was recently proposed. This approach is limited, however, by the challenges of defining a simple stochastic MOA of benzene-induced leukemogenesis and of identifying relevant and quantifiable parameters associated with potential key events. An alternative risk assessment approach is the application of toxicogenomics and systems biology in human populations, animals and in vitro models of the HSC stem cell niche, exposed to a range of levels of benzene. These approaches will inform our understanding of the mechanisms of benzene toxicity and identify additional biomarkers of exposure, early effect and susceptibility useful for risk assessment.","['McHale, Cliona M', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['McHale CM', 'Zhang L', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, Genes and Environment Laboratory, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7356, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20111212,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*poisoning/*toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Systems Biology/methods', 'Toxicogenetics/methods']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bgr297 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgr297 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 Feb;33(2):240-52. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgr297.

The mutants, specifically K274E, showed improved enzymatic properties at physiological conditions as compared to the wild type. All variants were thermodynamically stable and resistant to proteolytic digestion. None of the enzymes displayed glutaminase activity, a highly desirable therapeutic property. All variants showed higher and significant killing of human cell lines HL60, MCF7, and K562 as compared to the Escherichia coli l-asparaginase.

However, representing and incorporating domain information in the learning process is, in general, a challenging problem. In this research, we consider domain information encoded by discrete or categorical attributes. A discrete or categorical attribute provides a natural partition of the problem domain, and hence divides the original problem into several non-overlapping sub-problems. In this sense, the domain information is useful if the partition simplifies the learning task. The goal of this research is to develop an algorithm to identify discrete or categorical attributes that maximally simplify the learning task. RESULTS: We consider restructuring a supervised learning problem via a partition of the problem space using a discrete or categorical attribute. A naive approach exhaustively searches all the possible restructured problems. It is computationally prohibitive when the number of discrete or categorical attributes is large. We propose a metric to rank attributes according to their potential to reduce the uncertainty of a classification task. It is quantified as a conditional entropy achieved using a set of optimal classifiers, each of which is built for a sub-problem defined by the attribute under consideration. To avoid high computational cost, we approximate the solution by the expected minimum conditional entropy with respect to random projections. This approach is tested on three artificial data sets, three cheminformatics data sets, and two leukemia gene expression data sets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method is capable of selecting a proper discrete or categorical attribute to simplify the problem, i.e., the performance of the classifier built for the restructured problem always beats that of the original problem. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed conditional entropy based metric is effective in identifying good partitions of a classification problem, hence enhancing the prediction performance.","['Nan, Xiaofei', 'Fu, Gang', 'Zhao, Zhengdong', 'Liu, Sheng', 'Patel, Ronak Y', 'Liu, Haining', 'Daga, Pankaj R', 'Doerksen, Robert J', 'Dang, Xin', 'Chen, Yixin', 'Wilkins, Dawn']","['Nan X', 'Fu G', 'Zhao Z', 'Liu S', 'Patel RY', 'Liu H', 'Daga PR', 'Doerksen RJ', 'Dang X', 'Chen Y', 'Wilkins D']","['Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Mississippi, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111018,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Entropy', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/metabolism']",2011/12/23 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-12-S10-S22 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-12-S10-S22 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2011 Oct 18;12 Suppl 10:S22. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-S10-S22.,"['P20 RR021929/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR-14503-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5P20RR021929/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3236845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to define the effect of TYMS 5'-untranslated enhanced region (TSER) and 3'-untranslated region (TS3'-UTR) polymorphisms on the risk of hematological malignancies. Seventeen articles were identified as eligible in the case of TSER (2R > 3R) polymorphism (4511 cases and 6113 controls) and seven articles in the case of TS3'-UTR (1494del6) polymorphism (2721 cases and 3761 controls). The overall results suggested that either TSER or TS3'-UTR polymorphism was not associated with the risk of hematological malignancies. In stratified analyses, significantly decreased acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk was found in adults (2R/3R vs. 2R/2R: odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.97), but increased ALL risk was observed in children (3R/3R vs. 2R/2R: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.06). Increased non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk was found in the Caucasian population (2R/3R vs. 2R/2R: OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10-1.56). Protective effects of the TS3'-UTR polymorphism (-6 bp/-6 bp) on hematological malignancies were found in a homozygote model and recessive model when the source of controls was stratified as hospital based. In conclusion, the TYMS TSER polymorphism may contribute to a susceptibility to risk of ALL in children and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Caucasians, but protection from ALL risk in adults. The TS3'-UTR polymorphism (-6 bp/-6 bp) may have a protective effect in hematological malignancies.","['Weng, Yu', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Tang, Xue', 'Xie, Xinyou', 'Chen, Guangdi']","['Weng Y', 'Zhang J', 'Tang X', 'Xie X', 'Chen G']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120131,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adult', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ethnology/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/ethnology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/ethnology/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*genetics', 'Whites/genetics']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.649477 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1345-51. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.649477.

Given these data, we hypothesized that similar mutations may affect the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells and alter the proviral load (PvL). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional genetic analysis to compare the near-complete LTR nucleotide sequences that cover the TRE1 region in a sample of HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers with different PvL burden. METHODS: A total of 94 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers with both sequence from the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) and a PvL for Tax DNA measured using a sensitive SYBR Green real-time PCR were studied. The 94 subjects were divided into three groups based on PvL measurement: 31 low, 29 intermediate, and 34 high. In addition, each group was compared based on sex, age, and viral genotypes. In another analysis, the median PvLs between individuals infected with mutant and wild-type viruses were compared. RESULTS: Using a categorical analysis, a G232A substitution, located in domain A of the TRE-1 motif, was detected in 38.7% (12/31), 27.5% (8/29), and 61.8% (21/34) of subjects with low, intermediate, or high PvLs, respectively. A significant difference in the detection of this mutation was found between subjects with a high or low PvL and between those with a high or intermediate PvL (both p < 0.05), but not between subjects with a low or intermediate PvL (p > 0.05). This result was confirmed by a non-parametric analysis that showed strong evidence for higher PvLs among HTLV-1 positive individuals with the G232A mutation than those without this mutation (p < 0.03). No significant difference was found between the groups in relation to age, sex or viral subtypes (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The data described here show that changes in domain A of the HTLV-1 TRE-1 motif resulting in the G232A mutation may increase HTLV-1 replication in a majority of infected subjects.","['Neto, Walter K', 'Da-Costa, Antonio C', 'de Oliveira, Ana Carolina S', 'Martinez, Vanessa P', 'Nukui, Youko', 'Sabino, Ester C', 'Sanabani, Sabri S']","['Neto WK', 'Da-Costa AC', 'de Oliveira AC', 'Martinez VP', 'Nukui Y', 'Sabino EC', 'Sanabani SS']","['Fundacao Pro-Sangue, Blood Center of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carrier State/physiopathology/*virology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Point Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Response Elements', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-535 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-535 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Dec 13;8:535. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-535.,,PMC3287369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide evidence that Hsp32 is constitutively expressed in primary leukemic cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in various AML cell lines (HL60, U937, KG1). Expression of Hsp32 mRNA was demonstrable by qPCR, and expression of the Hsp32 protein by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. The stem cell-enriched CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- fractions of AML cells were found to express Hsp32 mRNA in excess over normal CD34+ progenitor cells. Two Hsp32-targeting drugs, pegylated zinc-protoporphyrin (PEG-ZnPP) and styrene-maleic-acid-copolymer-micelle-encapsulated ZnPP (SMAZnPP), were found to inhibit cytokine-dependent and spontaneous proliferation in all 3 AML cell lines as well as in primary AML cells. Growth inhibitory effects of SMA-ZnPP and PEG-ZnPP were dose-dependent with IC50 values ranging between 1 and 20 muM, and were accompanied by apoptosis as evidenced by light- and electron microscopy, Tunel assay, and caspase-3 activation. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that SMA-ZnPP inhibits cytokine-dependent proliferation of CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- AML progenitor cells in vitro in all patients as well as leukemiainitiation of AML stem cells in NOD-SCID IL-2Rgamma(-/-) (NSG) mice in vivo. Together, our data suggest that Hsp32 plays an important role as a survival factor in leukemic stem cells and as a potential new target in AML.","['Herrmann, H', 'Kneidinger, M', 'Cerny-Reiterer, S', 'Rulicke, T', 'Willmann, M', 'Gleixner, K V', 'Blatt, K', 'Hormann, G', 'Peter, B', 'Samorapoompichit, P', 'Pickl, W', 'Bharate, G Y', 'Mayerhofer, M', 'Sperr, W R', 'Maeda, H', 'Valent, P']","['Herrmann H', 'Kneidinger M', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Rulicke T', 'Willmann M', 'Gleixner KV', 'Blatt K', 'Hormann G', 'Peter B', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Pickl W', 'Bharate GY', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Sperr WR', 'Maeda H', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig-Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (copoly(styrene-maleic acid)-zinc protoporphyrin)', '0 (pegylated zinc protoporphyrin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Maleates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency', 'Metalloporphyrins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polystyrenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CCDT/E-Pub/00177 [pii]', '10.2174/156800912798888992 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2012 Jan;12(1):51-63. doi: 10.2174/156800912798888992.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The factors associated with a high risk of mycoses include, among others, corticosteroidotherapy, the administration antibiotics with wide spectrum of antibacterial properties, neutropenia, neoplasms. Fungi may play a role in cancer formation, may act as a complication in the course of treatment, and may mimic a neoplastic process by giving a similar clinical picture. In the case of fungal throat infection, patients complain of increased body temperature, a general feeling of weakness, malaise, headache, spontaneous pain intensifying during swallowing, a feeling of an obstacle in the throat or a cough. A physical examination may reveal congestion of the mucosa followed by a unilateral crater ulceration often covered with fat, as well as a thick coating, which is accompanied by foetor ex ore. The submandibular and neck lymph nodes are often greatly enlarged and painful. These symptoms may resemble those associated with the neoplastic process and changes in the course of systemic diseases (agranulocytosis). A correct diagnosis in these cases is necessary for adequate therapy. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia among adults in Europe and North America. It is estimated that in Poland, CLL affects approximately 1,400 people per year. In this paper, a case of 62-years old patient with CLL with fungal infection of oral cavity and throat is presented.","['Kaczmarczyk, Dariusz', 'Morawiec-Sztandera, Alina', 'Niedzwiecka, Izabela', 'Kurnatowski, Piotr']","['Kaczmarczyk D', 'Morawiec-Sztandera A', 'Niedzwiecka I', 'Kurnatowski P']","['Department of Head and Neck Neoplasm Surgery, Medical University of Lodz, 4 Paderewskiego Street, 93-509 Lodz, Poland. kaczmard@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Wiad Parazytol,Wiadomosci parazytologiczne,0420554,,IM,"['Candida glabrata/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/*microbiology/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/*microbiology', 'Necrosis/pathology', 'Pharyngitis/*microbiology', 'Pharynx/microbiology/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/03/15 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Wiad Parazytol. 2011;57(3):155-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Forty-one patients received methadone for inpatient or outpatient pain management. The authors retrospectively reviewed their demographic characteristics, diagnoses, type of pain (nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed) and causes of pain, and the indications, dose regimens, adverse effects, and outcomes of methadone treatment. RESULTS: There were four types of clinical uses for methadone in 41 patients (10 patients had two): nociceptive pain unresponsive to other opioids (17 patients, 33.3 percent), neuropathic pain (20 patients, 39.2 percent), facilitation of weaning from opioids (11 patients, 21.6 percent), and end-of-life pain management (3 patients, 5.9 percent). The mean age of the 24 males (58.5 percent) and 17 females (41.5 percent) at the start of treatment was 15.7 years (range, 0.6-23 years). The most common diagnoses were leukemia (n = 10, 24.4 percent), osteosarcoma (n = 7, 17.0 percent), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 5, 12.2 percent). The causes of pain were bone marrow transplant (n = 13, 31.7 percent), amputation (n = 6, 14.6 percent), chemotherapy (n = 5, 12.2 percent), tumor (n = 5, 12.2 percent), limb-sparing surgery (n = 4, 9.8 percent), and other (n = 8, 19.5 percent). Efficacy was assessed at the end (or after 6 months) of methadone treatment. For many patients (43.1 percent), methadone showed efficacy in achieving the purpose for which it was prescribed, including reduction of nociceptive or neuropathic pain and prevention of opioid withdrawal. Sedation was the most common side effect (24.4 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Methadone was effective for pediatric patients with neuropathic pain or nociceptive pain unresponsive to other opioids, and it effectively prevented opioid withdrawal.","['Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Faughnan, Lane G', 'Hankins, Gisele M', 'Ward, Deborah A', 'Oakes, Linda L']","['Anghelescu DL', 'Faughnan LG', 'Hankins GM', 'Ward DA', 'Oakes LL']","[""Division of Anesthesia and Pain Management Service, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Opioid Manag,Journal of opioid management,101234523,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', 'UC6VBE7V1Z (Methadone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methadone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pain Measurement', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/prevention & control', 'Tennessee', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/15 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/12/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5055/jom.2011.0076 [doi]'],ppublish,J Opioid Manag. 2011 Sep-Oct;7(5):353-61. doi: 10.5055/jom.2011.0076.,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA021765-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4400821,,['NIHMS676701'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the probable long lasting treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the knowledge of their effects on normal cells is of pivotal importance. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of dasatinib treatment on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that dasatinib induces MSCs adipocytic differentiation. Particularly, when the TKI is added to the medium inducing osteogenic differentiation, a high MSCs percentage acquires adipocytic morphology and overexpresses adipocytic specific genes, including PPARgamma, CEBPalpha, LPL and SREBP1c. Dasatinib also inhibits the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an osteogenic marker, and remarkably reduces matrix mineralization. The increase of PPARgamma is also confirmed at protein level. The component of osteogenic medium required for dasatinib-induced adipogenesis is dexamethasone. Intriguingly, the increase of adipocytic markers is also observed in MSCs treated with dasatinib alone. The TKI effect is phenotype-specific, since fibroblasts do not undergo adipocytic differentiation or PPARgamma increase. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that dasatinib treatment affects bone marrow MSCs commitment and suggest that TKIs therapy might modify normal phenotypes with potential significant negative consequences.","['Borriello, Adriana', 'Caldarelli, Ilaria', 'Basile, Maria Assunta', 'Bencivenga, Debora', 'Tramontano, Annunziata', 'Perrotta, Silverio', 'Della Ragione, Fulvio', 'Oliva, Adriana']","['Borriello A', 'Caldarelli I', 'Basile MA', 'Bencivenga D', 'Tramontano A', 'Perrotta S', 'Della Ragione F', 'Oliva A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*cytology', 'Adipogenesis/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mesoderm/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028555 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17036 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28555. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028555.

Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of DNR was limited because of its cytotoxity at high dosage. As a novel cytoprotective mechanism for tumor cell to survive under unfavorable conditions, autophagy has been proposed to play a role in drug resistance of tumor cells. Whether DNR can activate to impair the sensitivity of cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we first report that DNR can induce a high level of autophagy, which was associated with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Moreover, cell death induced by DNR was greatly enhanced after autophagy inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and siRNAs targeting Atg5 and Atg7, the most important components for the formation of autophagosome. In conclusion, we found that DNR can induce cytoprotective autophagy by activation of ERK in myeloid leukemia cells. Autophagy inhibition thus represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of DNR in the treatment of patients with myeloid leukemia.","['Han, Weidong', 'Sun, Jie', 'Feng, Lifeng', 'Wang, KaiFeng', 'Li, Da', 'Pan, Qin', 'Chen, Yan', 'Jin, Wei', 'Wang, Xian', 'Pan, Hongming', 'Jin, Hongchuan']","['Han W', 'Sun J', 'Feng L', 'Wang K', 'Li D', 'Pan Q', 'Chen Y', 'Jin W', 'Wang X', 'Pan H', 'Jin H']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antirheumatic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/methods', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028491 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-10939 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28491. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028491.

We monitored the effect of 1,763 MHz RF radiation on cultured human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) by evaluating changes in the expression of cytokines related to hair growth. The expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA in hDPCs was significantly induced upon RF radiation at the specific absorption rate of 10 W/kg, which resulted in increased expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) proteins and increased phosphorylation of MAPK1 protein. Exposure to 10 W/kg RF radiation 1 h per day for 7 days significantly enhanced hair shaft elongation in ex vivo hair organ cultures.

The PI3K/Akt pathway is a known target of Ras; however, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to lead to neoplastic transformation of not only myeloid but also lymphoid cells, suggesting that pathways other than the PI3K/Akt pathway should play a central role in pathogenesis of Ras-mediated MDS/MPN. The MEK/ERK pathway is another downstream target of Ras, which is involved in regulation of cell survival and proliferation. However, the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPN remains unclear. Here, we show that introduction of a constitutively activated form of MEK into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) causes hematopoietic neoplasms that are limited to MDS/MPNs, despite the multipotent differentiation potential of HSCs. Active MEK-mediated MDS/MPNs are lethal, but are not considered a frank leukemia because it cannot be transplanted into naive animals. However, transplantation of MDS/MPNs co-expressing active MEK and an anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-2, results in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL), suggesting that longevity of cells may impact transplantability and alter disease phenotype. Our results clearly demonstrate the proto-oncogenic property of the MEK/ERK pathway in hematopoietic cells, which manifest in MDS/MPN development.","['Chung, Eva', 'Hsu, Chia-Lin', 'Kondo, Motonari']","['Chung E', 'Hsu CL', 'Kondo M']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028350 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-01361 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28350. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028350.

Little is still known about the interactions and cytotoxicity effects between donor NK cells and recipient cancer cells. The cell-based micro device first showed the capability of cell docking, movement, contact and cell-cell interaction with respect to cell cytotoxicity of NK cells against cancer cells. With various flow tests for live cell loading, flow rates of 10 muL/h were chosen for injection in the central and side flows such that both types of suspension cells could be gently docked at the gap structure in a reaction zone. The trapping number of particles and cells was linearly proportional to the gap length. Finally, the cytotoxicity of around 40% was found to be similar in the case of dilute cells and a large cell population. As a result, the cell manipulation microdevice has been validated for live suspensions of natural killer and cancer cells, and exhibited the capability to measure the cytotoxicity of dilute cell suspensions.","['Lai, Fei-Lung', 'Wang, Yu-Hung', 'Chung, Yu-Wei', 'Hwang, Shiaw-Min', 'Huang, Long-Sun']","['Lai FL', 'Wang YH', 'Chung YW', 'Hwang SM', 'Huang LS']","['Institute of Applied Mechanics, National Taiwan University, 1 Sec. 4 Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan. f95543034@ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111012,Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,['0 (Suspensions)'],IM,"['Cell Aggregation', '*Cell Communication', '*Cell Movement', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Particle Size', 'Pressure', 'Rheology', 'Suspensions']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/s111009613 [doi]', 's111009613 [pii]']",ppublish,Sensors (Basel). 2011;11(10):9613-27. doi: 10.3390/s111009613.

HERVs influence cellular gene expression and contribute to normal physiological processes such as cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. HERVs have also been associated with certain pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. As HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and has been shown to modulate host gene expression mainly through the expression of the powerful Tax transactivator, herein we were interested in looking at the potential modulation capacity of HTLV-1 Tax on HERV expression. In order to evaluate the promoter activity of different HERV LTRs, pHERV-LTR-luc constructs were co-transfected in Jurkat T-cells with a Tax expression vector. Tax expression potently increased the LTR activity of HERV-W8 and HERV-H (MC16). In parallel, Jurkat cells were also stimulated with different T-cell-activating agents and HERV LTRs were observed to respond to different combination of Forskolin, bpV[pic] a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and PMA. Transfection of expression vectors for different Tax mutants in Jurkat cells showed that several transcription factors including CREB appeared to be important for HERV-W8 LTR activation. Deletion mutants were derived from the HERV-W8 LTR and the region from -137 to -123 was found to be important for LTR response following Tax expression in Jurkat cells, while a different region was shown to be required in cells treated with activators. Our results thus demonstrated that HTLV-1 Tax activates several HERV LTRs. This raises the possibility that upregulated HERV expression could be involved in diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection.","['Toufaily, Chirine', 'Landry, Sebastien', 'Leib-Mosch, Christine', 'Rassart, Eric', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Toufaily C', 'Landry S', 'Leib-Mosch C', 'Rassart E', 'Barbeau B']","['Departement des sciences biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, SB-R860, 2080 St-Urbain, Montreal, Quebec, H2X 3X8, Canada. toufaily.chirine@courrier.uqam.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111102,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/v3112146 [doi]', 'v3112146 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Nov;3(11):2146-59. doi: 10.3390/v3112146.

Mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptosis. Mitochondria-specific therapy would provide an efficient strategy for treating resistant cancers. DESIGN AND METHODS: A strategy was proposed here to overcome MDR by designing cancer mitochondria-specific drug-loaded liposomes, namely, antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes, aimed at treating resistant leukemia by targeting mitochondria. Evaluations were performed on human chronic leukemia K562, MDR K562/ADR cells, and female BALB/c nude mice xenografted with MDR K562/ADR cells. The liposomes were characterized through assays of cytotoxicity, mitochondrial targeting, caspase-9 and caspase-3, antitumor activities, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) analysis. RESULTS: The average size of antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes was in the range of 105-115 nm. Antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes were effective in inhibiting proliferation of MDR K562/ADR cells in vitro and selectively accumulated into the mitochondria. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity was increased after applying antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes. In xenografted resistant MDR K562/ADR tumor in nude mice, antiresistant tumor effect of antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes was evidently observed. Apoptotic inducing effects by antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes were noticeably evidenced via mitochondrial pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Antiresistant epirubicin mitosomes had significant inhibitory effect against resistant leukemia in vitro and in vivo, hence providing a promising strategy for improving therapeutic efficacy in resistant human leukemia.","['Men, Ying', 'Wang, Xiao-Xing', 'Li, Ruo-Jing', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Tian, Wei', 'Yao, Hong-Juan', 'Ju, Rui-Jun', 'Ying, Xue', 'Zhou, Jia', 'Li, Nan', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Yu, Yang', 'Lu, Wan-Liang']","['Men Y', 'Wang XX', 'Li RJ', 'Zhang Y', 'Tian W', 'Yao HJ', 'Ju RJ', 'Ying X', 'Zhou J', 'Li N', 'Zhang L', 'Yu Y', 'Lu WL']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Amlodipine', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epirubicin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/22 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S24847 [doi]', 'ijn-6-3125 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:3125-37. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S24847.

It is important for physicians to recognise the neurological manifestations of childhood leukaemia and extensive work-up should be carried out to exclude secondary causes of facial palsy.","['Karimi, Mehran', 'Cohan, Nader', 'Zareifar, Soheila', 'Inaloo, Sorror', 'Kalikias, Sina', 'Moslemi, Sam']","['Karimi M', 'Cohan N', 'Zareifar S', 'Inaloo S', 'Kalikias S', 'Moslemi S']","['Hematology Research Center, Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, 3455667, Islamic Republic of Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091209,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,,,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1136/bcr.10.2008.1046 [doi]', 'bcr10.2008.1046 [pii]']",ppublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2009;2009. pii: bcr10.2008.1046. doi: 10.1136/bcr.10.2008.1046.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Swedish population-based registry data were used to evaluate risk of AML, MDS, and other malignancies among 24,573 first-degree relatives of 6,962 patients with AML and 1,388 patients with MDS compared with 106,224 first-degree relatives of matched controls. We used a marginal survival model to calculate familial aggregation. RESULTS: AML and/or MDS did not aggregate significantly in relatives of patients with AML. There was a modest risk ratio (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.8) in myeloproliferative/myeloid malignancies combined. The risks for any hematologic or any solid tumor were modestly but significantly increased. Relatives of patients with MDS did not show an increased risk for any hematologic tumors. In contrast, we found a significantly increased risk (RR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 38.0) of AML/MDS and of all myeloid malignancies combined (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 9.8) among relatives of patients diagnosed at younger than age 21 years. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence for familial aggregation of the severe end of the spectrum of myeloid malignancies (AML and MDS). The risks of myeloproliferative neoplasms were modestly increased with trends toward significance, suggesting a possible role of inheritance. In contrast, although limited in sample size, relatives of young patients with AML were at increased risk of AML/MDS, suggesting that germline genes may play a stronger role in these patients. The increased risk of all hematologic malignancies and of solid tumors among relatives of patients with AML suggests that genes for malignancy in general and/or other environmental factors may be shared.","['Goldin, Lynn R', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Liang, Xueying Sharon', 'Derolf, Asa R', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus']","['Goldin LR', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Liang XS', 'Derolf AR', 'Landgren O', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, DCEG, NCI, 6120 Executive Blvd, Room 7124, MSC 7236, Bethesda, MD 20892-7236, USA. goldinl@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111212,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.1203 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.1203 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jan 10;30(2):179-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.1203.

PROCEDURE: We recruited 56 survivors, mean age 13.4 years (SD 4.1), a mean of 9.1 years (SD 4.1) post-diagnosis. The BMI for age was used to define weight status relative to national (Saudi) and international (Cole et al., Cole-IOTF, WHO, and CDC) reference data. We measured body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile (HDL-C, Triglycerides), fasting glucose and insulin. RESULTS: According to international definitions based on BMI for age, around half of the sample had unhealthy weight status. All of the approaches based on BMI for age underestimated overfatness, present in 27/51 (53%) of the sample according to DXA. Prevalence of MS was 7.1% (3/42 of those over 9-years old) and 5.4% (3/56) by applying the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition and National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment panel Guidelines (NCEP III), respectively. However, MS by the NCEP III definition was present in 19% of the overweight and obese survivors and 7.1% of the sample had at least two of the components of MS. CONCLUSION: Unhealthy body weight and overfatness may be common amongst adolescent Saudi survivors of standard risk ALL, though overweight and obesity may be no more common than in the general Saudi adolescent population. Defining weight status using BMI underestimates overfatness. Ideally, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors should be monitored at late effects clinics.","['Aldhafiri, Fahad', 'Al-Nasser, Abdullah', 'Al-Sugair, Abdulaziz', 'Al-Mutairi, Hanan', 'Young, David', 'Reilly, John J']","['Aldhafiri F', 'Al-Nasser A', 'Al-Sugair A', 'Al-Mutairi H', 'Young D', 'Reilly JJ']","['College of Medical, Veterinary, and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111211,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Obesity/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Triglycerides/blood', 'Waist Circumference']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24012 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):133-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24012.

Optimal timing for placement of a CVC is controversial. We sought to determine whether early placement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a group at high risk for infection and thrombosis, was associated with an increased rate of surgical complications. PROCEDURE: We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for early surgical complications in children with ALL diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 at a single pediatric cancer center. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two patients were studied. There were 17 episodes of bloodstream infection, for a 30-day incidence of 9.8% (95% CI, 5.9-15%). There were no surgical site infections and no CVC was removed due to infection. Early thrombosis occurred in only one patient, 3 days after CVC placement. Infection was not influenced by catheter type, patient age, body mass index, or fever at the time of placement. The infection rate was not statistically higher when the ANC was <500/mm(3) at the time of CVC placement (14.2% vs. 6.8%; P = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Early CVC placement at the time of diagnosis of ALL was associated with a low surgical complication rate with no catheters requiring removal due to infection. Utilizing our current methods of preoperative preparation, surgical management and postoperative CVC care, early placement of a CVC is safe in children with ALL even when their ANC is <500/mm(3) , but larger cohort studies would be helpful to further clarify this issue.","['Gonzalez, G', 'Davidoff, A M', 'Howard, S C', 'Pui, C-H', 'Rao, B N', 'Shenep, J L', 'Wozniak, A', 'Shochat, S J']","['Gonzalez G', 'Davidoff AM', 'Howard SC', 'Pui CH', 'Rao BN', 'Shenep JL', 'Wozniak A', 'Shochat SJ']","[""Department of Surgery, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111211,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Catheterization, Central Venous', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infection Control', '*Infections', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24010 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Apr;58(4):498-502. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24010.

We investigated 9,550 patients with myeloid disorders for ETV6 rearrangements by chromosome banding analysis and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. ETV6 rearrangements were identified in 51 of 9,550 (0.5%) patients (range, 19.2-85.3 years). Frequencies were in detail: acute myeloid leukemia (AML): 40 of 3,798, 1.1%; myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): 6 of 3,375, 0.2%; myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs): 5 of 1,720, 0.3%; MDS/MPN: 0 of 210; and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 0 of 447. Thirty-three different partner bands of ETV6 were identified, and most were recurrent: 3q26 (n = 10), 5q33 (n = 4), 17q11 (n = 3), 22q12 (n = 3), 5q31 (n = 2), and 2q31 (n = 2). Additional chromosomal abnormalities were identified in 29 of 51 (57%) ETV6 rearranged cases. In AML, ETV6 rearrangements were frequently associated with NPM1 (9/39, 23%) and RUNX1 mutations (6/31, 19%). The FAB M0 subtype was more frequent in ETV6 rearranged de novo AML than other AML (P < 0.001); expression of CD7 and CD34 by immunophenotyping was higher in ETV6 rearranged AML compared with other subgroups. Survival of 29 ETV6 rearranged de novo AML was compared with 818 AML from other cytogenetic subgroups.

We evaluated whether IGF-I is a useful marker for altered body composition and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in this group. PROCEDURE: We analyzed retrospective data from 610 adult childhood cancer survivors, retrieved from the late effects clinic. Median age at diagnosis was 6 years (interquartile range 3-11) and follow-up time was 18 years (13-24). We assessed IGF-I standard deviation scores (SDS), anthropometrical measures, growth hormone stimulation tests in patients with clinical signs of GHD, and measures of body composition (assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry, Lunar Prodigy). RESULTS: In 58 cranially irradiated acute leukemia survivors (25 Gy (24-25)) and 56 locally irradiated brain tumor survivors (42 Gy (35-54)) we found significantly lower IGF-I SDS (P < 0.001), lower height SDS (P < 0.001), higher body mass index (P = 0.01), higher waist-hip ratio (WHR; P = 0.001), higher total fat percentage SDS (P < 0.001), and lower lean body mass SDS (P < 0.001), as compared to 452 not cranially irradiated survivors. IGF-I showed a weak inverse correlation with BMI (r = -0.12, P = 0.04), WHR (r = -0.15, P = 0.01), total fat percentage (r = - 0.14, P = 0.02), and a positive correlation with lean body mass (r = 0.15, P = 0.01). In patients with low IGF-I levels, IGF-I did not significantly differ between subjects with and without GHD as determined by GH-stimulation testing (P = 0.39). CONCLUSION: This study shows that IGF-I has limited value as a marker for alterations in body composition in adult childhood cancer survivors.","['Blijdorp, Karin', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Boot, Annemieke', 'Sluimer, Johanna', 'van der Lelij, Aart-Jan', 'Neggers, Sebastian']","['Blijdorp K', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink M', 'Pieters R', 'Boot A', 'Sluimer J', 'van der Lelij AJ', 'Neggers S']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. k.blijdorp@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111211,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adiposity', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', '*Body Composition/radiation effects', 'Body Height/radiation effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', '*Survivors', 'Waist Circumference']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24015 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Oct;59(4):711-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24015.

We consider the cumulative definition of sensitivity and dynamic definition of specificity at a time horizon, that is, the probability of a positive marker in the population that will relapse (cases) and that will not relapse (controls). In the presence of censoring, sensitivity and specificity cannot be estimated by proportions because it is not known whether censored subjects should be considered as cases or controls. The solutions proposed do not enable to obtain asymptotic confidence intervals. We explore the use of inverse probability of censoring weighting/imputation (borrowed from the methodology used to correct for verification bias) to adjust the classification matrix for the presence of censoring. The adjustment based on weights estimated conditional on the marker turned to be equivalent to the adjustment based on imputation. These approaches, which address for the presence of marker-dependent censoring, showed a better performance than the adjustment based on weights estimated on the entire sample, even in the case of marker-independent censoring. We derived single intervals and confidence region for sensitivity and 1-specificity using the delta method. The confidence region is particularly useful for a binary marker because the marker has some ability to discriminate among cases and controls only if the region does not intersect the first quadrant bisector.","['Antolini, Laura', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Antolini L', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Department of Clinical Medicine and Prevention, Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Milano-Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20053, Monza, Italy. laura.antolini@unimib.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111212,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Recurrence', '*Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4443 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 May 20;31(11-12):1113-28. doi: 10.1002/sim.4443.

Supporting stroma using HS-5 cells was established in HFBR system and the current bioprocess configuration yielded an average glucose consumption of 640 mg/day and an average protein concentration of 6.40 mg/mL in the extracapillary space over 28 days. Co-culture with erythroleukemia K562 cells was used as a model for myelo-leukemic cell proliferation and differentiation. Two distinct localizations of K562 cells (loosely adhered and adherent cells) were identified and characterized after 2 weeks. The HFBR co-culture resulted in greater leukemic cell expansion (3,130 fold vs. 43 fold) compared to a standard tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) culture. Majority of expanded cells (68%) in HFBR culture were the adherent population, highlighting the importance of cell-cell contact for myelo-leukemic proliferation. Differentiation tendencies in TCP favored maturation toward monocyte and erythrocyte lineages but maintained a pool of myeloid progenitors. In contrast, HFBR co-culture exhibited greater lineage diversity, stimulating monocytic and megakaryocytic differentiation while inhibiting erythroid maturation. With the extensive stromal expansion capacity on hollow fiber surfaces, the HFBR system is able to achieve high cell densities and 3D cell-cell contacts mimicking the bone marrow microenvironment. The proposed in vitro system represents a dynamic and highly scalable 3D co-culture platform for the study of cell-stroma dependent hematopoietic/leukemic cell functions and ex vivo expansion.","['Usuludin, Suaidah Binte Mohamed', 'Cao, Xue', 'Lim, Mayasari']","['Usuludin SB', 'Cao X', 'Lim M']","['Division of Bioengineering, School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111216,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Proteins)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['*Bioreactors', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Organ Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.24400 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2012 May;109(5):1248-58. doi: 10.1002/bit.24400.

This escalating load of disease with a constant threat to life requires an intensive comprehensive response. For our understanding about the cancer treatment capabilities, novel medicinal platforms should be strived to explore among the existing conventional and molecular approaches that have already been proven to be successful in fighting against genetic diseases. Several DNA therapeutics previously studied are currently in clinical settings. RNA interfering antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) is the most experimentally advanced molecular therapeutic which has the potential to modify the gene activity resulting in the down regulation of particular protein. In this study, we focused on the inhibition of Notch2 function in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) by AS-ODN (phosphorothioate oligomers) targeted to the initiation codon region of the Notch2 mRNA. We investigated the in vitro ability of four such oligomers to reduce the expression of Notch2 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients. Our findings implicate that AS-ODNs specifically designed for the region of 314-333 neucleotides (AS1) of Notch2 inhibits its gene expression better than other AS-ODNs designed for other regions and respond in a dose dependent manner. The results of cell proliferation assay for the evaluation of AS1 in gene silencing, infer that the number of cells were reduced to 80% (P < 0.001). Our results implicate that using the AS-ODNs against specific Notch2 nucleotide sequence can be used as future therapeutic agent with the ability of Notch2 down regulation, which is the root problem in the pathogenicity of B-CLL.","['Fatima, Kaneez', 'Paracha, Rehan Zafar', 'Qadri, Ishtiaq']","['Fatima K', 'Paracha RZ', 'Qadri I']","['NUST Centre of Virology and Immunology (NCVI), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Sector H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111210,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-011-1301-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2012 May;39(5):5059-67. doi: 10.1007/s11033-011-1301-5.

METHODS: All cases were studied by R-band karyotypic analysis using direct method and/or short-term culture for chromosomes preparation. Interphase-FISH was performed in 108 cases of AML with M5, M4, M2, M3 subtypes including 103 cases with normal karyotypes, 4 cases with chromosomal abnormalities other than specific chromosomal rearrangements using chromosome translocation probe such as AML1/ETO, PML/RARalpha, CBFbeta/MYH11 and MLL. RESULTS: Of 38 cases of M2-AML without t(8;21) on conventional cytogenetics(CC) analysis, 4 cases showed positivity for AML1/ETO fusion transcript, which included 2 cases with typical signal model and 2 with insertion. Of 9 cases of M3-AML without t(15;17) on CC analysis, 6 showed positivity for PML/RARalpha fusion transcript including 2 with typical signal model, 3 with insertion, one without PML/RARalpha rearrangement on reverse transcription-PCR and FISH assay using PML/RARalpha probe.

To verify whether and which pathways involved in CE accumulation are essential in tumour proliferation, the effect of CE deprivation, from both exogenous and endogenous sources, on CEM-CCRF cells was investigated. Cholesterol synthesis, esterification and content, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-CE uptake were evaluated in cultured in both conventional and delipidated bovine serum with or without oleic or linoleic acids, cholesteryl oleate, LDL and HDL. High content of CEs in lipid droplets in this cell line was due to esterification of both newly synthesised cholesterol and that obtained from hydrolysis of LDL; moreover, a significant amount of CE was derived from HDL-CE uptake. Cell proliferation was slightly affected by either acute or chronic treatment up to 400 muM with Sz-58035, an acyl-cholesteryl cholesterol esterification inhibitor (ACAT); although when the enzyme activity was continuously inhibited, CE content in lipid droplets was significantly higher than those in control cells. In these cells, analysis of intracellular and medium CEs revealed a profile reflecting the characteristics of bovine serum, suggesting a plasma origin of CE molecules. Cell proliferation arrest in delipidated medium was almost completely prevented in the first 72 h by LDL or HDL, although in subsequent cultures with LDL, it manifested an increasing mortality rate. This study suggests that high content of CEs in CEM-CCRF is mainly derived from plasma lipoproteins and that part of CEs stored in lipid droplets are obtained after being taken up from HDL. This route appears to be up-regulated according to cell requirements and involved in low levels of c-HDL during cancer. Moreover, the dependence of tumour cells on a source of lipoprotein provides a novel impetus in developing therapeutic strategies for use in the treatment of some tumours.","['Uda, Sabrina', 'Accossu, Simonetta', 'Spolitu, Stefano', 'Collu, Maria', 'Angius, Fabrizio', 'Sanna, Francesca', 'Banni, Sebastiano', 'Vacca, Claudia', 'Murru, Elisabetta', 'Mulas, Claudia', 'Diaz, Giacomo', 'Batetta, Barbara']","['Uda S', 'Accossu S', 'Spolitu S', 'Collu M', 'Angius F', 'Sanna F', 'Banni S', 'Vacca C', 'Murru E', 'Mulas C', 'Diaz G', 'Batetta B']","['Department of Science and Biomedical Technologies, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111210,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Cholesterol Esters/*chemistry', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Esters/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/therapy', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Lipoproteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-011-0270-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Apr;33(2):443-53. doi: 10.1007/s13277-011-0270-6.

Beside PTKs, PTK inhibitors alter the activity of a large number of voltage-dependent ion channels. hERG1 K(+) channels are highly expressed in leukemia cells and appear of exceptional importance in favoring leukemogenesis. The present study explored a possible regulatory effect of imatinib upon hERG1 K(+) channels as a means to uncover new molecular events involved in the antileukemic activity of this PTK inhibitor in CML. The results demonstrated that hERG1 was highly detected in K562 cells and primary CML cells, and down-regulated by imatinib at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, imatinib markedly reduced hERG currents in HEK293T-hERG cells, this effect was accompanied by inhibition of CML cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Moreover, these antileukemia effects of imatinib were potentiated by E-4031, a specific hERG1 inhibitor. Together, these results provide evidence of a novel potential molecular mechanism of antileukemic activities by imatinib which, independent of targeting tyrosine kinase, highlight hERG1 K(+) channels as a therapeutic target for CML treatment.","['Zheng, Fang', 'Li, Huiyu', 'Liang, Kaiwei', 'Du, Yimei', 'Guo, Dongmei', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Zheng F', 'Li H', 'Liang K', 'Du Y', 'Guo D', 'Huang S']","[""Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jiefang Road 1277, Wuhan 430022, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111210,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/drug effects/metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0102-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2127-35. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0102-y.

However, the development of PRES in adult leukemia patients during chemotherapy is very rare. We present a case of PRES in an adult patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after remission induction chemotherapy. A 28-year-old woman with ALL was administered remission induction chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase. After initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed paralytic ileus and hypertension, and on day 30, she suddenly developed generalized convulsions, loss of visual acuity, and muscle weakness in the legs. Magnetic resonance imaging findings and her signs and symptoms were typical of PRES. The symptoms gradually improved following treatment with an anticonvulsant and an antihypertensive agent, and the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. She has completely recovered from PRES and has been asymptomatic without leukemia relapse. During remission induction chemotherapy for ALL, PRES may be caused by multiple drugs, such as L-asparaginase, vincristine, and corticosteroids, with different mechanisms of action. PRES should be recognized as an important complication, which will occur more frequently with the increased intensity of chemotherapy for adult ALL patients.","['Tsukamoto, Shokichi', 'Takeuchi, Masahiro', 'Kawajiri, Chika', 'Tanaka, Satomi', 'Nagao, Yuhei', 'Sugita, Yasumasa', 'Yamazaki, Atsuko', 'Kawaguchi, Takeharu', 'Muto, Tomoya', 'Sakai, Shio', 'Takeda, Yusuke', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Shimizu, Naomi', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Iseki, Tohru', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki']","['Tsukamoto S', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kawajiri C', 'Tanaka S', 'Nagao Y', 'Sugita Y', 'Yamazaki A', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Muto T', 'Sakai S', 'Takeda Y', 'Ohwada C', 'Sakaida E', 'Shimizu N', 'Yokote K', 'Iseki T', 'Nakaseko C']","['Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8670, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111209,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Radiography', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-011-0982-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Feb;95(2):204-8. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0982-9.

Detection of increasing minimal residual disease (MRD) following HCT may permit early intervention to prevent clinical relapse; however, MRD quantification remains an uncommon diagnostic test because of logistical and financial barriers to widespread use. Here we describe a method for quantifying CLL MRD using widely available consensus primers for amplification of all Ig heavy chain (IGH) genes in a mixture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for disease-specific IGH sequence quantification. To achieve accurate MRD quantification, we developed a systematic bioinformatic methodology to aggregate cancer clone sequence variants arising from systematic and random artifacts occurring during IGH-HTS. We then compared the sensitivity of IGH-HTS, flow cytometry, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR for MRD quantification in 28 samples collected from 6 CLL patients following allogeneic HCT. Using amplimer libraries generated with consensus primers from patient blood samples, we demonstrate the sensitivity of IGH-HTS with 454 pyrosequencing to be 10(-5), with a high correlation between quantification by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR and IGH-HTS (r = 0.85). From the same dataset used to quantify MRD, IGH-HTS also allowed us to profile IGH repertoire reconstitution after HCT-information not provided by the other MRD methods. IGH-HTS using consensus primers will broaden the availability of MRD quantification in CLL and other B cell malignancies, and this approach has potential for quantitative evaluation of immune diversification following transplant and nontransplant therapies.","['Logan, Aaron C', 'Gao, Hong', 'Wang, Chunlin', 'Sahaf, Bita', 'Jones, Carol D', 'Marshall, Eleanor L', 'Buno, Ismael', 'Armstrong, Randall', 'Fire, Andrew Z', 'Weinberg, Kenneth I', 'Mindrinos, Michael', 'Zehnder, James L', 'Boyd, Scott D', 'Xiao, Wenzhong', 'Davis, Ronald W', 'Miklos, David B']","['Logan AC', 'Gao H', 'Wang C', 'Sahaf B', 'Jones CD', 'Marshall EL', 'Buno I', 'Armstrong R', 'Fire AZ', 'Weinberg KI', 'Mindrinos M', 'Zehnder JL', 'Boyd SD', 'Xiao W', 'Davis RW', 'Miklos DB']","['Divisions of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Hematology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1118357109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1118357109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 27;108(52):21194-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1118357109.

Long-term culture of B-CLL clones would permit the collection and characterization of B-CLL mAbs to study antigen specificity and of B-CLL DNA to investigate molecular mechanisms promoting the disease. However, the derivation of long-term cell lines (eg, by EBV), has not been efficient. We have improved the efficiency of EBV B-CLL transformation of CpG oligonucleotide-stimulated cells by incubating patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of an irradiated mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1. Using this approach, peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 13 of 21 B-CLL patients were transformed as documented by IGHV-D-J sequencing. Four clones grew and retained CD5 expression in culture for 2 to 4 months. However, despite documentation of EBV infection by expression of EBNA2 and LMP1, B-CLL cells died after removal of macrophage feeder cells. Nevertheless, using electrofusion technology, we generated 6 stable hetero-hybridoma cell lines from EBV-transformed B-CLL cells, and these hetero-hybridomas produced immunoglobulin. Thus, we have established enhanced methods of B-CLL culture that will enable broader interrogation of B-CLL cells at the genetic and protein levels.","['Hwang, Kwan-Ki', 'Chen, Xi', 'Kozink, Daniel M', 'Gustilo, Marietta', 'Marshall, Dawn J', 'Whitesides, John F', 'Liao, Hua-Xin', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Luftig, Micah A', 'Haynes, Barton F', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Hwang KK', 'Chen X', 'Kozink DM', 'Gustilo M', 'Marshall DJ', 'Whitesides JF', 'Liao HX', 'Catera R', 'Chu CC', 'Yan XJ', 'Luftig MA', 'Haynes BF', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (EBNA-2 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics', 'Feeder Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46087-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-371203 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 16;119(7):e35-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-371203.

Here, we present a multistep in vitro and in vivo approach to identify compounds that can target L-ICs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A high-throughput screen of 4000 compounds on novel leukemia cell lines derived from human experimental leukemogenesis models yielded 80 hits, of which 10 were less toxic to HSPC. We characterized a single compound, kinetin riboside (KR), on AML L-ICs and HSPCs. KR demonstrated comparable efficacy to standard therapies against blast cells in 63 primary leukemias. In vitro, KR targeted the L-IC-enriched CD34(+)CD38(-) AML fraction, while sparing HSPC-enriched fractions, although these effects were mitigated on HSC assayed in vivo. KR eliminated L-ICs in 2 of 4 primary AML samples when assayed in vivo and highlights the importance of in vivo L-IC and HSC assays to measure function.

Our clinical protocol consisted of chemotherapy followed by an infusion of anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells and a course of IL-2. Six of the 8 patients treated on our protocol obtained remissions of their advanced, progressive B-cell malignancies. Four of the 8 patients treated on the protocol had long-term depletion of normal polyclonal CD19(+) B-lineage cells. Cells containing the anti-CD19 CAR gene were detected in the blood of all patients. Four of the 8 treated patients had prominent elevations in serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IFNgamma and TNF. The severity of acute toxicities experienced by the patients correlated with serum IFNgamma and TNF levels. The infused anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells were a possible source of these inflammatory cytokines because we demonstrated peripheral blood T cells that produced TNF and IFNgamma ex vivo in a CD19-specific manner after anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T-cell infusions. Anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells have great promise to improve the treatment of B-cell malignancies because of a potent ability to eradicate CD19(+) cells in vivo; however, reversible cytokine-associated toxicities occurred after CAR-transduced T-cell infusions.","['Kochenderfer, James N', 'Dudley, Mark E', 'Feldman, Steven A', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Spaner, David E', 'Maric, Irina', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Phan, Giao Q', 'Hughes, Marybeth S', 'Sherry, Richard M', 'Yang, James C', 'Kammula, Udai S', 'Devillier, Laura', 'Carpenter, Robert', 'Nathan, Debbie-Ann N', 'Morgan, Richard A', 'Laurencot, Carolyn', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Kochenderfer JN', 'Dudley ME', 'Feldman SA', 'Wilson WH', 'Spaner DE', 'Maric I', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Phan GQ', 'Hughes MS', 'Sherry RM', 'Yang JC', 'Kammula US', 'Devillier L', 'Carpenter R', 'Nathan DA', 'Morgan RA', 'Laurencot C', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. kochendj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111208,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49202-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-384388 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2709-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-384388.

In this study, we investigated the regulation of BIM, a proapoptotic BCL2-related protein, which is tightly regulated by phosphorylation. Surface IgM stimulation increased phosphorylation of 2 BIM isoforms, BIM(EL) and BIM(L), in a subset of CLL samples. In contrast, in normal B cells, anti-IgM triggered selective phosphorylation of BIM(EL) only. In CLL, anti-IgM-induced BIM phosphorylation correlated with unmutated IGHV gene status and with progressive disease. Strikingly, it was also associated with progressive disease within the mutated IGHV gene subset. BIM phosphorylation was dependent on MEK1/2 kinase activity, and we identified BIM(EL) serine 69, previously linked to pro-survival responses, as the major site of phosphorylation in CLL and in Ramos cells. BIM(EL)/BIM(L) phosphorylation was associated with release of the pro-survival protein MCL1. Coculture of CLL cells with HK cells, a model of the CLL microenvironment, promoted CLL cell survival and was associated with MEK1/2 activation and BIM(EL) phosphorylation. Hence, BIM phosphorylation appears to play a key role in apoptosis regulation in CLL cells, potentially coordinating antigen and microenvironment-derived survival signals. Antigen-mediated effects on BIM may be an important determinant of clinical behavior.","['Paterson, Alex', 'Mockridge, C Ian', 'Adams, Jemimah E', 'Krysov, Sergey', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Duncombe, Andrew S', 'Cook, Simon J', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Packham, Graham']","['Paterson A', 'Mockridge CI', 'Adams JE', 'Krysov S', 'Potter KN', 'Duncombe AS', 'Cook SJ', 'Stevenson FK', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (anti-IgM)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46076-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-367417 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 16;119(7):1726-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-367417.

It is therefore important to verify that KIT mutations cooperate with CBFB-MYH11, the fusion gene generated by inv(16), for leukemogenesis. Here, we transduced wild-type and conditional Cbfb-MYH11 knockin (KI) mouse bone marrow (BM) cells with KIT D816V/Y mutations. KIT transduction caused massive BM Lin(-) cell death and fewer colonies in culture that were less severe in the KI cells. D816Y KIT but not wild-type KIT enhanced proliferation in Lin(-) cells and led to more mixed lineage colonies from transduced KI BM cells. Importantly, 60% and 80% of mice transplanted with KI BM cells expressing D816V or D816Y KIT, respectively, died from leukemia within 9 months, whereas no control mice died. Results from limiting dilution transplantations indicate higher frequencies of leukemia-initiating cells in the leukemia expressing mutated KIT. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that p44/42 MAPK and Stat3, but not AKT and Stat5, were strongly phosphorylated in the leukemia cells. Finally, leukemia cells carrying KIT D816 mutations were sensitive to the kinase inhibitor PKC412.

The identification of recurrent mutations in MDS samples has led to new insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders. Of particular interest is the recent recognition that genes involved in the regulation of histone function (EZH2, ASXL1, and UTX) and DNA methylation (DNMT3A, IDH1/IDH2, and TET2) are recurrently mutated in MDS, providing an important link between genetic and epigenetic alterations in this disease. The mechanism by which these mutated genes contribute to disease pathogenesis is an active area of research, with a current focus on which downstream target genes may be affected. Recent advances from sequencing studies suggest that multiple mutations are required for MDS initiation and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The past several years have yielded many new insights, but the complete genetic landscape of MDS is not yet known. Moreover, few (if any) of the findings are sufficiently robust to be incorporated into routine clinical practice at this time. Additional studies will be required to understand the prognostic implications of these mutations for treatment response, progression to AML, and survival.","['Graubert, Timothy', 'Walter, Matthew J']","['Graubert T', 'Walter MJ']","['Washington University, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. graubert@medicine.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+) ALCL), the cure rate for PTCLs with CHOP is low, and limited evidence suggests that anthracyclines do not improve the prognosis. However, there is no compelling evidence that any other regimen or approach is superior. It remains challenging to compare alternative therapies or treatment strategies with CHOP because the majority of data are retrospective and include diverse patient populations.

For this, a range of biological tools have been developed, including analysis of skin fibroblasts. FA patients experience a strong selective pressure in the BM that predisposes to clonal evolution and to the emergence in their teens or young adulthood of myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a specific pattern of somatic chromosomal lesions. The cellular mechanisms underlying (1) the hematopoietic defect which leads to progressive BMF and (2) somatic clonal evolutions in this background, are still largely elusive. Elucidation of these mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels should be useful to understand the physiopathology of the disease and to adapt the follow-up and treatment of FA patients.

In its classic form, it is characterized by mucocutaneous abnormalities, BM failure, and a predisposition to cancer. BM failure is the principal cause of premature mortality. Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-""the telomereopathies."" These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology. They are also facilitating the diagnosis (especially when presentation is atypical) and management of DC.","['Dokal, Inderjeet']",['Dokal I'],"['Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom. i.dokal@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The development of first-generation (imatinib) and second-generation (dasatinib and nilotinib) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein produced by the Ph chromosome revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL0031 trial showed that the addition of imatinib to intensive chemotherapy did not cause increased toxicity and resulted in 3-year event-free survival rates that were more than double those of historical control data from the pre-imatinib era. These findings create a new paradigm for integrating molecularly targeted agents with conventional chemotherapy and call for a reassessment of the routine use of HSCT for children and adolescents with Ph(+) ALL. Second-generation TKIs have theoretical advantages over imatinib, and are now being tested in Ph(+) ALL. The focus of contemporary trials is to define the optimal use of chemotherapy, HSCT, and TKI in Ph(+) ALL. In the coming years, it is anticipated that additional agents will become available to potentiate TKI therapy and/or circumvent TKI resistance in Ph(+) ALL. Recent genomic studies have identified a subtype of high-risk pediatric B-cell-precursor ALL with a gene-expression profile similar to that of Ph(+) ALL, suggestive of active kinase signaling. Many of these Ph-like ALL cases harbor chromosome rearrangements and mutations that dysregulate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling, and these leukemias may also be candidates for TKI therapy.","['Hunger, Stephen P']",['Hunger SP'],"[""Children's Hospital Colorado and Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA. hunger.stephen@tchden.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The presence of an MLL rearrangement generally confers a poor prognosis. There are more than 60 known fusion partners of MLL having some correlation with disease phenotype and prognosis. The most common fusion proteins induce the inappropriate expression of homeotic (Hox) genes, which, during normal hematopoiesis, are maintained by wild-type MLL. MLL-rearranged leukemias display remarkable genomic stability, with very few gains or losses of chromosomal regions. This may be explained by recent studies suggesting that MLL-rearranged leukemias are largely driven by epigenetic dysregulation. Several epigenetic regulators that modify DNA or histones have been implicated in MLL-fusion driven leukemogenesis, including DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation. The histone methyltransferase DOT1L has emerged as an important mediator of MLL-fusion-mediated leukemic transformation. The clinical development of targeted inhibitors of these epigenetic regulators may therefore hold promise for the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Bernt KM', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

However, relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure after allogeneic HSCT for patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. Further improvements in exploiting the GVL effect to prevent relapse in high-risk leukemias while minimizing toxicity have focused on the use of targeted antileukemic immunotherapy. These strategies include methods to boost the GVL effect with leukemia vaccines or the adoptive transfer of leukemia-specific lymphocytes. Vaccines can be classified as those against defined antigens such as minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) or leukemia-associated antigens (PR1, WT1, and BCR-ABL) and those that have broad ""antileukemic"" activity such as engineered irradiated leukemia cells or leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCs). The unique posttransplantation milieu, which is characterized by lymphopenia, regulatory T-cell depletion, and the release of growth factors, provides a unique opportunity for effective antitumor immunotherapy and augmenting specific GVL responses.

ET evolves to myelofibrosis in a minority of cases, whereas transformation to acute leukemia is rare and increases in association with the use of certain therapies. Survival of ET patients does not substantially differ from that of the general population. However, important morbidity is derived from vascular complications, including thrombosis, microvascular disturbances, and bleeding. Because of this, treatment of ET must be aimed at preventing thrombosis and bleeding without increasing the risk of transformation of the disease. Patients are considered at high risk of thrombosis if they are older than 60 years or have a previous history of thrombosis and at high risk of bleeding if platelet counts are > 1500 x 10(9)/L. Patients with low-risk ET are usually managed with low-dose aspirin, whereas treatment of high-risk ET is based on the use of cytoreductive therapy, with hydroxyurea as the drug of choice and IFN-alpha being reserved for young patients or pregnant women. For patients resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea, anagrelide is recommended as second-line therapy. Strict control of coexistent cardiovascular risk factors is mandatory for all patients. The role in ET therapy of new drugs such as pegylated IFN or the JAK2 inhibitors is currently under investigation.","['Cervantes, Francisco']",['Cervantes F'],"['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Nevertheless, blast crisis occurs at an incidence of 1%-2% per year, and once this has occurred, treatment options are limited and survival is short. Due to the overall therapeutic success, the prevalence of CML is gradually increasing. The optimal management of this disease includes access to modern therapies and standardized surveillance methods for all patients, which will certainly create challenges. Furthermore, all available TKIs show mild but frequent side effects that may require symptomatic therapy. Adherence to therapy is the key prerequisite for efficacy of the drugs and for long-term success. Comprehensive information on the nature of the disease and the need for the continuous treatment using the appropriate dosages and timely information on efficacy data are key factors for optimal compliance. Standardized laboratory methods are required to provide optimal surveillance according to current recommendations. CML occurs in all age groups. Despite a median age of 55-60 years, particular challenges are the management of the disease in children, young women with the wish to get pregnant, and older patients.

It is now clear that CLL is a relatively proliferative disorder that requires the help of its microenvironment to be maintained and to progress. The stimulation of the CLL cell occurs in most, if not all, patients through antigen stimulation via the BCR. In addition, there is now a clearer appreciation of the role of the p53 pathway leading to chemoresistance. These insights are allowing a more targeted approach with the use of p53-independent drugs such as mAbs and high-dose steroids to overcome genetically poor-risk CLL. The elucidation of the molecular and intracellular signaling mechanisms of disease is just beginning to facilitate the development of several targeted small molecules that promise to revolutionize the treatment of CLL. The measurement of the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) in CLL is becoming more available, facilitating approaches in which the aim of therapy is the eradication of detectable MRD. This also promises to improve personalization of therapy to the individual. Recently, the addition of rituximab to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FCR) has improved overall survival in CLL for the first time, and it appears that this will only be the first small step on the path to much more effective therapies and, hopefully, less toxic targeted therapies.","['Hillmen, Peter']",['Hillmen P'],"[""Institute of Oncology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom. peter.hillmen@nhs.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

However, over the past decade, it became increasingly clear that external signals from the leukemia microenvironment make pivotal contributions to disease progression in CLL and other B-cell malignancies. Consequently, increasing emphasis is now placed on exploring and targeting the CLL microenvironment. This review highlights critical cellular and molecular pathways of CLL-microenvironment cross-talk. In vitro and in vivo models for studying the CLL microenvironment are discussed, along with their use in searching for therapeutic targets and in drug testing. Clinically, CXCR4 antagonists and small-molecule antagonists of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated kinases (spleen tyrosine kinase [Syk], Bruton's tyrosine kinase [Btk], and PI3Kdelta) are the most advanced drugs for targeting specific interactions between CLL cells and the miocroenvironment. Preclinical and first clinical evidence suggests that high-risk CLL patients can particularly benefit from these alternative agents. These findings indicate that interplay between leukemia-inherent and environmental factors, nature and nurture determines disease progression in CLL.","['Burger, Jan A']",['Burger JA'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Nonetheless, incomplete response, relapse, and progression to myelodysplasia/leukemia have more clearly emerged as significant long-term issues. Improvements in outcome of alternative donor transplantation and the use of established and novel immunosuppressive agents provide multiple alternatives for treating refractory or relapsed patients. Best practices in this regard are not yet clearly established and may vary by a variety of demographic and treatment-specific factors. Regardless of the type of therapeutic approach, patients require ongoing monitoring for occurrence of disease and/or therapy-related side effects.","['Guinan, Eva C']",['Guinan EC'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA. eva_guinan@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

ARE/poly(U)-binding factor 1 (AUF1) belongs to a protein family that controls mRNA stability and translation by associating with adenosine- and uridine-rich regions of target messengers. We investigated the involvement of AUF1 in cytokine-induced beta cell dysfunction. METHODS: Production and subcellular distribution of AUF1 isoforms were analysed by western blotting. To test for their role in the control of beta cell functions, each isoform was overproduced individually in insulin-secreting cells. The contribution to cytokine-mediated beta cell dysfunction was evaluated by preventing the production of AUF1 isoforms by RNA interference. The effect of AUF1 on the production of potential targets was assessed by western blotting. RESULTS: MIN6 cells and human pancreatic islets were found to produce four AUF1 isoforms (p42>p45>p37>p40). AUF1 isoforms were mainly localised in the nucleus but were partially translocated to the cytoplasm upon exposure of beta cells to cytokines and activation of the ERK pathway. Overproduction of AUF1 did not affect glucose-induced insulin secretion but promoted apoptosis. This effect was associated with a decrease in the production of the anti-apoptotic proteins, B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1 (MCL1). Silencing of AUF1 isoforms restored the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, attenuated the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) pathway, and protected the beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings point to a contribution of AUF1 to the deleterious effects of cytokines on beta cell functions and suggest a role for this RNA-binding protein in the early phases of type 1 diabetes.","['Roggli, E', 'Gattesco, S', 'Pautz, A', 'Regazzi, R']","['Roggli E', 'Gattesco S', 'Pautz A', 'Regazzi R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Morphology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Rue du Bugnon 9, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (HNRNPD protein, human)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1beta/pharmacology', 'Islets of Langerhans/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00125-011-2399-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2012 Jun;55(6):1699-708. doi: 10.1007/s00125-011-2399-7.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor saquinavir is active in vitro against chronic myeloid leukaemia cells, in synergy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Here, we evaluated the effects of saquinavir, alone or in association with imatinib, on cell proliferation (count of viable cells after trypan blue exclusion), apoptosis (Annexin V binding) and invasion (through a transwell membrane coated with Matrigel) in SJ-N-KP, IMR5, AF-8, SK-N-SH and SK-N-BE NB lines, all expressing c-kit and PDGF-R (determined by flow cytometry). Saquinavir showed a dose-dependent anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activity on NB lines, increased by the association with imatinib when the two drugs were utilized at clinically attainable concentrations. The same low saquinavir concentrations inhibited in NB cells the nuclear activation of NF-kappaB (Western immuno-blotting for nuclear NF-kappaB p50 and p65). Saquinavir at high concentrations also exerted a pro-apoptotic activity on NB lines, significantly increased by the association with imatinib. In conclusion, saquinavir and imatinib are both drugs utilized for long-term therapies, with good oral bioavailability and a well-known toxicity profile. The anti-NB activity of saquinavir and of its association with imatinib suggests a potential usefulness in the treatment of NB, particularly for remission maintenance.","['Timeus, Fabio', 'Crescenzio, Nicoletta', 'Doria, Alessandra', 'Foglia, Luiselda', 'Pagliano, Sara', 'Ricotti, Emanuela', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Tovo, Pier Angelo', 'Cordero di Montezemolo, Luca']","['Timeus F', 'Crescenzio N', 'Doria A', 'Foglia L', 'Pagliano S', 'Ricotti E', 'Fagioli F', 'Tovo PA', 'Cordero di Montezemolo L']","[""Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, and Department of Paediatrics, University of Turing, Piazza Polonia 94, I-10126 Turin, Italy. fabio.timeus@unito.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'L3JE09KZ2F (Saquinavir)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/prevention & control', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Saquinavir/administration & dosage']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2011.1582 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Mar;27(3):734-40. doi: 10.3892/or.2011.1582.

The mean change in the variations of cancer mortality trends in this age group was calculated. RESULTS: Deaths from cancer accounted for 3.5% of mortality in children under 15 years of age. During the periods 1985-1989 and 2005-2008 there was a decrease in mortality from cancer in both sexes, with figures dropping from 54.4 deaths per million to 44.8 deaths per million in boys and from 40.9 deaths per million to 37.9 deaths per million in girls.

METHODS: A retrospective study of the period from 2001 to 2011, which included 16 pregnant women with a diagnosis of leukemia followed by antenatal care specialists in hematological diseases and pregnancy. For acute leukemia diagnosed after the first trimester, the recommendation was to perform chemotherapy despite the current pregnancy. For chronic leukemia, patients who were controlled in hematological terms were maintained without medication during pregnancy, or chemotherapy was introduced after the first trimester. We analyzed the maternal and perinatal outcome. RESULTS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in five cases (31.3%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in two cases (12.5%) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in nine cases (56.3%). Of the cases of acute leukemia, two (28.6%) were diagnosed in the first trimester, two (28.6%) in the second and three (42.9%) in the third. Two patients with ALL diagnosed in the first trimester opted for therapeutic abortion. Four patients with acute leukemia received chemotherapy during pregnancy, with a diagnosis established after the 20th week. In one case of ALL with a late diagnosis (30 weeks), chemotherapy was started after delivery. All pregnant women with acute leukemia developed anemia and thrombocytopenia, and four (57.1%) developed febrile neutropenia. Of nine pregnant women with CML, four were treated with imatinib mesylate when they became pregnant, with treatment being interrupted in the first trimester in three of them and in the second trimester in one. During pregnancy, three patients (33.3%) required no chemotherapy after discontinuation of imatinib, and six (66.7%) were treated with the following drugs: interferon (n=5) and/or hydroxyurea (n=3 ). In the group of pregnant women with CML, anemia occurred in four (44.4%) cases and thrombocytopenia in one (11.1%). The perinatal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by acute leukemia were as follows: mean gestational age at delivery was 32 weeks (standard deviation - SD=4.4) and the mean birth weight was 1476 g (SD=657 g), there were 2 (40.0%) perinatal deaths (a fetal one and a neonatal one). In pregnancies complicated by CML, the mean gestational age at delivery was 37.6 weeks (SD=1.1) and the mean birth weight was 2870 g (SD=516 g). There was no perinatal death and no fetal abnormality was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and fetal morbidity is high in pregnancies complicated by acute leukemia. Whereas, in pregnancies complicated by CML, the maternal and fetal prognosis appears to be more favorable, with greater ease in management of complications.","['Nomura, Roseli Mieko Yamamoto', 'Igai, Ana Maria Kondo', 'Faciroli, Natalia Cristina', 'Aguiar, Isabela Neto', 'Zugaib, Marcelo']","['Nomura RM', 'Igai AM', 'Faciroli NC', 'Aguiar IN', 'Zugaib M']","['Departamento de Obstetricia e Ginecologia Faculdade deMedicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP,Brasil.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,9214757,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['S0100-72032011000800002 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet. 2011 Aug;33(8):174-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Resultados maternos e perinatais em gestantes portadoras de leucemia.,,,,,

The method was developed by testing 86 metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, sugars, purines, pyrimidines, vitamins, and nucleosides, that can be resolved by combining chromatographic and m/z dimensions. Subsequently, a targeted quantitative method was developed for 80 metabolites. The presented method combines a UPLC approach using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and MS detection achieved by a hybrid quadrupole-time of flight (Q-ToF) mass spectrometer. The optimal setup was achieved by evaluating reproducibility and repeatability of the analytical platforms using pooled quality control samples to minimize the drift in instrumental performance over time. Then, the method was validated by analyzing extracellular metabolites from acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM) treated with direct (A-769662) and indirect (AICAR) AMP activated kinase (AMPK) activators, monitoring uptake and secretion of the targeted compound over time. This analysis pointed towards a perturbed purine and pyrimidine catabolism upon AICAR treatment. Our data suggest that the method presented can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of extracellular metabolites and it is suitable for routine applications such as in vitro drug screening.","['Paglia, Giuseppe', 'Hrafnsdottir, Sigrun', 'Magnusdottir, Manuela', 'Fleming, Ronan M T', 'Thorlacius, Steinunn', 'Palsson, Bernhard O', 'Thiele, Ines']","['Paglia G', 'Hrafnsdottir S', 'Magnusdottir M', 'Fleming RM', 'Thorlacius S', 'Palsson BO', 'Thiele I']","['Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Sturlugata 8, Reykjavik 101, Iceland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20111213,Germany,Anal Bioanal Chem,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,101134327,"['0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'P68477CD2C', '(4-hydroxy-3-(4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)phenyl)-6-oxo-7H-thieno(2,3-b)pyridine-5-carboni', 'trile)']",IM,"['Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Pyrones/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00216-011-5556-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Bioanal Chem. 2012 Jan;402(3):1183-98. doi: 10.1007/s00216-011-5556-4.

Here we have reconstituted fully functional yeast Set1/COMPASS and human MLL/COMPASS-like complex in vitro and have identified the minimum subunit composition required for histone H3K4 methylation. These subunits include the methyltransferase C-terminal SET domain of Set1/MLL, Cps60/Ash2L, Cps50/RbBP5, Cps30/WDR5, and Cps25/Dpy30, which are all common components of the COMPASS family from yeast to human. Three-dimensional (3D) cryo-EM reconstructions of the core yeast complex, combined with immunolabeling and two-dimensional (2D) EM analysis of the individual subcomplexes reveal a Y-shaped architecture with Cps50 and Cps30 localizing on the top two adjacent lobes and Cps60-Cps25 forming the base at the bottom. EM analysis of the human complex reveals a striking similarity to its yeast counterpart, suggesting a common subunit organization. The SET domain of Set1 is located at the juncture of Cps50, Cps30, and the Cps60-Cps25 module, lining the walls of a central channel that may act as the platform for catalysis and regulative processing of various degrees of H3K4 methylation. This structural arrangement suggested that COMPASS family members function as exo-methylases, which we have confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies.","['Takahashi, Yoh-hei', 'Westfield, Gerwin H', 'Oleskie, Austin N', 'Trievel, Raymond C', 'Shilatifard, Ali', 'Skiniotis, Georgios']","['Takahashi YH', 'Westfield GH', 'Oleskie AN', 'Trievel RC', 'Shilatifard A', 'Skiniotis G']","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111207,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy/methods', 'DNA Methylation', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Insecta', 'Methylation', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1109360108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1109360108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 20;108(51):20526-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1109360108.

We show here that cAMP acted synergistically with DNR to induce IPC cell death. The DNR-induced death differed from that induced by cAMP by (1) not involving Bim induction, (2) being abrogated by GSK3beta inhibitors, (3) by being promoted by the HSP90/p23 antagonist geldanamycin and truncated p23 and (4) by being insensitive to the CRE binding protein (CREB) antagonist ICER and to cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors. In contrast, the apoptosis induced by cAMP correlated tightly with Bim protein expression. It was abrogated by Bim (BCL2L11) downregulation, whether achieved by the CREB antagonist ICER, by CDK inhibitors, by Bim-directed RNAi, or by protein synthesis inhibitor. The forced expression of BimL killed IPC-81(WT) cells rapidly, Bcl2-overexpressing cells being partially resistant. The pivotal role of CREB and CDK activity for Bim transcription is unprecedented. It is also noteworthy that newly developed cAMP analogs specifically activating PKA isozyme I (PKA-I) were able to induce IPC cell apoptosis.

The safety and efficacy of this new conditioning regimen has been investigated prospectively in patients with AML. A total number of 75 patients with AML in CR were treated with 3 x 14 g/m(2) treosulfan and 5 x 30 mg/m(2) fludarabine, followed by matched sibling or unrelated SCT. Patients were evaluated for engraftment, adverse events, GVHD, and for non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, overall and disease-free survival (DFS). All patients showed primary engraftment of neutrophils after a median of 20 days. Non-hematological adverse events grade III-IV in severity included mainly infections (59%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (7%). Acute GVHD grade II-IV occurred in 21% and extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 16% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 715 days, the 2-year overall and DFS estimates were 61% and 55%, respectively. The 2-year incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality reached 34% and 11%, respectively.

Mcm proteins are typically loaded in excess of the number of locations that are used during S-phase. Nonetheless, partial depletion of Mcm proteins leads to cancers and stem cell deficiencies. Mcm2 deficient mice, on a 129Sv genetic background, display a high rate of thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma. Here array comparative genomic hybridization is used to characterize the genetic damage accruing in these tumors. The predominant events are deletions averaging less than 0.5 Mbp, considerably shorter than observed in prior studies using alternative mouse lymphoma models or human tumors. Such deletions facilitate identification of specific genes and pathways responsible for the tumors. Mutations in many genes that have been implicated in human lymphomas are recapitulated in this mouse model. These features, and the fact that the mutation underlying the accelerated genetic damage does not target a specific gene or pathway a priori, are valuable features of this mouse model for identification of tumor suppressor genes. Genes affected in all tumors include Pten, Tcfe2a, Mbd3 and Setd1b. Notch1 and additional genes are affected in subsets of tumors. The high frequency of relatively short deletions is consistent with elevated recombination between nearby stalled replication forks in Mcm2-deficient mice.","['Rusiniak, M E', 'Kunnev, D', 'Freeland, A', 'Cady, G K', 'Pruitt, S C']","['Rusiniak ME', 'Kunnev D', 'Freeland A', 'Cady GK', 'Pruitt SC']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Mcm2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011566 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.566 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Sep 6;31(36):4034-44. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.566.

A cell can die through the apoptosis or necrosis pathway. Recent investigations suggest that in apoptotic-deficient conditions, such as most types of cancer, a process of programmed necrosis, called necroptosis, prevails. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this alternative cell death pathway are still not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that CLL cells failed to undergo necroptosis upon stimulation of TNFalpha combined with pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD). Two core components of necroptotic machine, RIP3 and deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD), are markedly downregulated in CLL. Moreover, we identified lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a downstream effector of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, as a transcription repressor of CYLD in CLL. Knocking down LEF1 sensitizes CLL cells to TNFalpha/zVAD-induced necroptosis. The present investigation provides the first evidence that CLL cells have defects not only in apoptotic program but also in necroptotic signaling. Targeting the key regulators of necroptotic machine, such as LEF1, to restore this pathway may represent a novel approach for CLL treatment.","['Liu, P', 'Xu, B', 'Shen, W', 'Zhu, H', 'Wu, W', 'Fu, Y', 'Chen, H', 'Dong, H', 'Zhu, Y', 'Miao, K', 'Xu, W', 'Li, J']","['Liu P', 'Xu B', 'Shen W', 'Zhu H', 'Wu W', 'Fu Y', 'Chen H', 'Dong H', 'Zhu Y', 'Miao K', 'Xu W', 'Li J']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China. liupeng8888@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (CYLD protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Necrosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011357 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.357 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1293-300. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.357.

For improved treatment results more knowledge about CML stem cells is needed. We here present a new flow cytometric approach enabling prospective discrimination of CML stem cells from their normal counterparts within single-patient samples. In 24 of 40 newly diagnosed CML patients residual normal CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cells could be identified by lower CD34 and CD45 expression, lower forward/sideward light scatter and by differences of lineage marker expression (CD7, CD11b and CD56) and of CD90. fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on Fluorescence-activated cell sorting sorted cells proved that populations were BCR-ABL positive or negative and long-term liquid culture assays with subsequent colony forming unit assays and FISH analysis proved their stem cell character. Patients with residual non-leukemic stem cells had lower clinical risk scores (Sokal, Euro), lower hematological toxicity of imatinib (IM) and better molecular responses to IM than patients without. This new approach will expand our possibilities to separate CML and normal stem cells, present in a single bone marrow or peripheral blood sample, thereby offering opportunities to better identify new CML stem-cell-specific targets. Moreover, it may guide optimal clinical CML management.","['Janssen, J J W M', 'Deenik, W', 'Smolders, K G M', 'van Kuijk, B J', 'Pouwels, W', 'Kelder, A', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Ossenkoppele, G J']","['Janssen JJ', 'Deenik W', 'Smolders KG', 'van Kuijk BJ', 'Pouwels W', 'Kelder A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jjwm.janssen@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111209,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011347 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.347 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):977-84. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.347.

Among those genomic events, the study of recurrent translocations, particularly common in oncohematology, has allowed for a better understanding of leucemogenesis and lymphomagenesis mechanisms. These translocations are classically distinguished depending on their physiopathologic consequences. It may encode for a fusion gene leading to a chimeric protein, which exhibits a new activity or an aberrant one, corresponding in most cases to the constitutive activation of a proto-oncogene. In other cases, these translocations may cause abnormal expression of a proto-oncogene with a regular structure by a transcriptional deregulation. Beyond this highlighting recurrent translocations and understanding better the physiopathologic consequences of these chromosomal modifications has a real impact on patients. These cytogenetic anomalies represent an essential diagnostic tool for some hematologies; and pave the way for a better evaluation of the prognosis and thus, a better adaptation of the therapeutic strategy. They also contributed to improve survival with the development of targeted therapies.

The natural history of MDS ranges from more indolent forms of disease spanning years to those rapidly progressing to overt leukemia. A distinct subset of MDS patients manifest overt autoimmune manifestations (AIMs), the pathogenesis and prognostic significance of which remain controversial. This review will briefly highlight aspects of immune-mediated myelosuppression and cytokine-induced cytopenias in MDS and further analyze MDS-associated AIMs clinically and pathogenetically. RECENT FINDINGS: Facts provided by advanced studies suggest that an immune reaction against the evolving clone, operated by macrophages, T, natural killer and other effectors contribute to ineffective and dysplastic MDS hemopoiesis. Despite the fact that several immunologic abnormalities have been described in MDS, the precise pathophysiologic mechanism underlying AIMs remains unclear. SUMMARY: The encouraging biological insights into the autoimmune component of MDS pathophysiology can lead to the development of novel forms of treatment for controlling MDS process. MDS with AIMs constitute an ideal model in the investigation of disordered immune function in preleukemic states.","['Giannouli, Stavroula', 'Kanellopoulou, Theoni', 'Voulgarelis, Michael']","['Giannouli S', 'Kanellopoulou T', 'Voulgarelis M']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Rheumatol,Current opinion in rheumatology,9000851,,IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*immunology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/BOR.0b013e32834db4ee [doi]', '00002281-201201000-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Rheumatol. 2012 Jan;24(1):97-102. doi: 10.1097/BOR.0b013e32834db4ee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New technologies, enabling characterization of the AML genome at increased resolution, have revealed deeper layers of complexity that have provided insights into the biological basis of this disease, nominated targets for therapy, and identified biomarkers predictive of response to therapy or long-term prognosis. Still, our understanding of AML genomics is incomplete. Recent publications have demonstrated that whole genome sequencing of primary AML samples is feasible and can detect novel, clinically relevant mutations. New insights are emerging from this work, including the clonal heterogeneity of this disease and clonal evolution that occurs over time. Some of the novel mutations are highly recurrent (>20% of patients), but there appears to be a continuum of mutation frequency down to rare (<5%) or even singleton mutations that may be relevant for the biology of this disease. Large cohorts of well-annotated samples are needed to establish mutation frequencies, implicate biological pathways, and demonstrate genotype-phenotype correlations. Although many technical and logistical challenges must be overcome, the capacity of whole genome sequencing to detect all classes of inherited and acquired genetic abnormalities makes it an attractive candidate for development as a clinical diagnostic test.","['Graubert, Timothy A', 'Mardis, Elaine R']","['Graubert TA', 'Mardis ER']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PPO.0b013e31823c5652 [doi]', '00130404-201111000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2011 Nov-Dec;17(6):487-91. doi: 10.1097/PPO.0b013e31823c5652.,"['P01CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HL102927/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079-06/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2HL102927/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HL102927-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3240851,,['NIHMS338159'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents interrupt a constitutively active BCR-ABL, the causative agent for CML, by interfering with adenosine 5' triphosphate-dependent ABL tyrosine kinase. Although the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has resulted in overall survival of greater than 90%, TKIs are not curative. Moreover, no currently approved TKIs are effective against the T315I BCR-ABL variant. However, a new generation of TKIs with activity against T315I is on the horizon. We will highlight the clinical utility of historical CML therapeutics, those used today (first- and second-generation TKIs), and discuss treatment modalities that are under development. Recent advances have illuminated the complexity of CML, especially within the marrow microenvironment. We contend that the key to curing CML will involve strategies beyond targeting BCR-ABL because primitive human CML stem cells are not dependent on BCR-ABL.

This has been due to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), compounds that inhibit the activity of the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 protein. Imatinib was the first TKI developed for CML, and it led to high rates of complete cytogenetic responses and improved survival for patients with this disease. However, approximately 35% of patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib will develop resistance or intolerance to this drug. The recognition of the problem of imatinib failure led to the design of second-generation TKI (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib). These drugs are highly active in the scenario of imatinib resistance or intolerance. More recently, both nilotinib and dasatinib were approved for frontline use in patients with chronic phase CML. Ponatinib represents the last generation of TKI, and this drug has been developed with the aim of targeting a specific BCR-ABL1 mutation (T315I), which arises in the setting of prolonged TKI therapy and leads to resistance to all commercially available TKI. Parallel to the development of specific drugs for treating CML, major advances were made in the field of disease monitoring and standardization of response criteria.

The degree of risk posed by the different underlying conditions is crucial to prioritize prevention programs that target the highest risk populations. METHODS: We reviewed cases of listeriosis reported in France from 2001 to 2008. Numbers of cases and deaths were tabulated by age and underlying condition. Measures of the impact of specific underlying conditions on the occurrence of listeriosis were calculated. For estimating the total number of persons living with specific diseases, we applied prevalence estimates of these diseases to the French population. Underlying conditions were ranked by the degree to which they increased the risk of listeriosis. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2008, 1959 cases of listeriosis were reported in France (mean annual incidence 0.39 per 100,000 residents). Compared with persons <65 years with no underlying conditions, those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had a >1000-fold increased risk of acquiring listeriosis, and those with liver cancer; myeoloproliferative disorder; multiple myeloma; acute leukemia; giant cell arteritis; dialysis; esophageal, stomach, pancreas, lung, and brain cancer; cirrhosis; organ transplantation; and pregnancy had a 100-1000-fold increased risk of listeriosis. CONCLUSIONS: To be effective and acceptable to physicians and patients, listeriosis prevention strategies should be targeted based on evidence of increased risk. Stringent dietary guidance, to avoid specific foods with a high risk for Listeria contamination, should be targeted to pregnant women and to others at highest risk of listeriosis.","['Goulet, Veronique', 'Hebert, Marjolaine', 'Hedberg, Craig', 'Laurent, Edith', 'Vaillant, Veronique', 'De Valk, Henriette', 'Desenclos, Jean-Claude']","['Goulet V', 'Hebert M', 'Hedberg C', 'Laurent E', 'Vaillant V', 'De Valk H', 'Desenclos JC']","['Institut de Veille Sanitaire, Saint-Maurice, France. v.goulet@invs.sante.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111209,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Listeriosis/complications/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cir902 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/cir902 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Mar 1;54(5):652-60. doi: 10.1093/cid/cir902.

In particular, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway can be effectively blocked by mTOR inhibitors, and several compounds can hit the RAS pathway and the resulting mitogen-activated protein (MAP) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (MEK) and MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, mitotic kinases can be blocked by Aurora kinase inhibitors, and Pim kinases can be blocked by selective serine-threonine kinase inhibitors. Finally, the abnormal pathways that sustain the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells are described as possible targets to completely eradicate leukemic clones. Such pathways include the Hedgehog pathway, which can be blocked by Smoothened inhibitors, and the CXCR4/SDF1 axis, which can be targeted by specific antagonists.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Cilloni D', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111208,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Translational Research, Biomedical']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-1613 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1613 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Feb 15;18(4):930-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1613.

A case report.,90-2,10.1159/000333085 [doi],"Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and the association of hypereosinophilia with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are both rare in children. Some acute myelogenous leukaemias can present with eosinophilia, but the relationship between HES and ALL is not well known and is rarer than the relationship between HES and acute myelogenous leukaemia. Patients are diagnosed with HES when no cause is found to explain the eosinophilia leading to end organ damage. For this reason, it is recommended that patients presenting with hypereosinophilia be carefully assessed to exclude any malignant clonal proliferation. HES may present with severe clinical manifestations such as high leucocyte count, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, hepatosplenomegaly or cardiac and neurological involvement, all of which are primarily features of myeloproliferative disorders. Some patients with HES can develop chronic eosinophilic leukaemia. Successful treatment of HES with agents used in chronic myeloid leukaemia supports the idea that HES can be a chronic myeloid disorder. There are few cases reporting an association between ALL and hypereosinophilia that precedes or is concomitant with ALL. Here we report the case of a 14-year-old girl who developed common B ALL 7 months after diagnosis and treatment of HES. Interestingly, eosinophilia was not concomitant with the diagnosis of ALL.","['Ayhan, Aylin Canbolat', 'Timur, Cetin', 'Ayhan, Yusuf', 'Cakir, Betul', 'Erguven, Muferet']","['Ayhan AC', 'Timur C', 'Ayhan Y', 'Cakir B', 'Erguven M']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Istanbul Goztepe Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. canbolataylin@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111206,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*etiology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000333085 [pii]', '10.1159/000333085 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(2):90-2. doi: 10.1159/000333085.

However, estimates of the associated risk of therapy-related acute leukaemia and cardiomyopathy have been derived from short-term studies. This study aimed to ascertain the long-term risk of therapy-related acute leukaemia or cardiomyopathy after mitoxantrone therapy for multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2010, 50 patients were treated with mitoxantrone at a single centre using a standard protocol (12 mg/m(2) body surface area monthly for 6 months as tolerated to a maximum of 72 mg/m(2) body surface area). Follow-up haematologic and echocardiographic data were collected in March 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (30%) were excluded from analysis either because of lack of follow-up data, death due to non-cardiac and non-haematologic causes, or comorbid cardiovascular disease. The remaining 35 patients (70%) were followed for a median of 75 months (range: 9-103). The median cumulative mitoxantrone dose given was 72 mg/m(2) body surface area (range: 24-123). At the end of follow-up, no patients had developed therapy-related acute leukaemia. One patient suffered an asymptomatic drop in left ventricular ejection fraction from 55 to 47%. CONCLUSION: This series of patients followed for up to 8.5 years suggests that the risk of either therapy-related acute leukaemia or cardiomyopathy after mitoxantrone therapy for multiple sclerosis is low when patients are treated within standard protocol.","['Mulroy, Eoin', 'Joyce, Emer', 'Scott, Jaqueline', 'Melling, Jane', 'Goggin, Carole', 'Mahon, Niall', ""O'Rourke, Killian"", 'Lynch, Timothy']","['Mulroy E', 'Joyce E', 'Scott J', 'Melling J', 'Goggin C', 'Mahon N', ""O'Rourke K"", 'Lynch T']","['Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111209,Switzerland,Eur Neurol,European neurology,0150760,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Risk', 'Ultrasonography']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['000334101 [pii]', '10.1159/000334101 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Neurol. 2012;67(1):45-7. doi: 10.1159/000334101.

Tet proteins can convert 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) through three consecutive oxidation reactions. These modified bases may represent new epigenetic states in genomic DNA or intermediates in the process of DNA demethylation. Emerging biochemical, genetic, and functional evidence suggests that Tet proteins are crucial for diverse biological processes, including zygotic epigenetic reprogramming, pluripotent stem cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, and development of leukemia.

MYLK is activated by Ca(2+)-calmodulin whereas MYLP is inhibited by phosphorylation of its myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1) by Ca(2+)-independent mechanisms, leading to generation of increased MYL phosphorylation and force for a given intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, a phenomenon known as 'calcium-sensitization'. The regulation of MYPT1 phosphorylation in human myometrium, which shows increasing phasic contractility at the onset of labour, has yet to be fully investigated. Here, we explore phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 and Thr853, alongside phosphorylation of MYL, in fresh human myometrial tissue and cultured myometrial cells. We report that pMYPT1 (Thr853) levels are dependent on the activity of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), determined using the ROCK inhibitor g-H-1152 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ROCK1/2, and are highly correlated to ppMYL (Thr18/Ser19) levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK was associated with a decrease in oxytocin (OXT)-stimulated contractility of myometrial strips in vitro. Moreover, we have measured pMYPT1 and pMYL levels between and during spontaneous and OXT-stimulated phasic contractions by rapidly freezing contracting muscle, and demonstrate for the first time functional coupling between increases in pMYPT1 (Thr853), ppMYL (Thr18/Ser19) and phasic contractility that is ROCK-dependent. The combined approach of measuring contractility and phosphorylation has demonstrated that the phosphorylation of MYPT1 (Thr853) changes dynamically with each contraction and has elucidated a defined role for ROCK in regulating myometrial contractility through MYLP, providing new insights into uterine physiology which will stimulate further research into treatments for preterm labour.","['Hudson, Claire A', 'Heesom, Kate J', 'Lopez Bernal, Andres']","['Hudson CA', 'Heesom KJ', 'Lopez Bernal A']","['Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS1 3NY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111208,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxytocics)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '50-56-6 (Oxytocin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.53 (Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.53 (PPP1R12A protein, human)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Myometrium/drug effects/*physiology', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxytocics/pharmacology', 'Oxytocin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pregnancy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Uterine Contraction/drug effects/*physiology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['gar078 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gar078 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2012 May;18(5):265-79. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gar078.

HQ705771) isolated from deep sea water column (1000m depth) near Andaman and Nicobar islands produced a bioactive lead, Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (BEHP) with a molecular formula of C(6)H(4)(CO(2)C(8)H(17))(2) and a molecular ion at m/z 391 (M(+)). Anti proliferative effect of the isolated compound was examined by MTT assay in human erythroleukemic K562 cells and the IC(50) of BEHP was found to be 21muM. BEHP was able to induce apoptosis involving caspases pathway, besides regulating mitochondrial enzymes. Further, western blot analysis revealed the activation of caspases family proteins viz., caspase 8, caspase-9 and caspase-3. An increase in the expression of Bax mRNA concomitant with a decrease in mRNA of Bcl-2 in BEHP treated K562 cells was also observed. AO/EB staining of BEHP treated K562 cells further confirmed the progression of apoptosis as evidenced by morphological changes including nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Treatment of K562 cells with BEHP induced the progressive accumulation of fragmented DNA in a time dependent manner. This pattern appeared as a typical laddering distribution of DNA fragmentation due to intranucleosomal cleavage associated with apoptosis. Based on flow cytometric analysis it has become evident that the compound was also effective in arresting the cell cycle at a sub G0/G1 phase.","['Moushumi Priya, A', 'Jayachandran, S']","['Moushumi Priya A', 'Jayachandran S']","['Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Pondicherry University, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111203,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacillus/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Seawater/microbiology', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00326-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Jan 25;195(2):133-43. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.11.005.

METHODS: Children (6 months to 21 years) with cancer, HIV infection, or sickle cell disease (SCD) received 1 or 2 doses of pandemic 2009 H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccine (H1N1 MIV). Safety and tolerability, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody titers were measured against 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus after each dose. Seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) rates were determined. RESULTS: 103 participants were enrolled and 99 were evaluable (39 with HIV, 37 with cancer and 23 with SCD). Mean age (+/-SD) was 7.9 (+/-5.4) years for cancer participants, 18.0 (+/-3.5) for HIV, and 13.3 (+/-4.2) for SCD. 54% were males; 65% black; and 96% had received seasonal influenza vaccine. HIV-infected participants had a median CD4 count of 625 cells/mm(3) (range, 140-1260). 46% had an undetectable HIV viral load and 41% were perinatally infected. No participant had vaccine-related serious adverse events. None developed influenza A proven illness during the 6 months after the vaccine. Local injection reactions were reported in 29% and systemic reactions in 42% after the first dose of vaccine. SC and SP were achieved after the last dose in 48% and 52%, respectively, of participants with leukemia or lymphoma, 50% and 75% of participants with solid tumors, 63% and 92% of HIV-infected participants, and 74% and 100% of participants with SCD. CONCLUSION: H1N1 MIV was safe and well tolerated. H1N1 MIV resulted in an adequate immune response in children with SCD. It was only modestly immunogenic in cancer or HIV participants.","['Hakim, Hana', 'Allison, Kim J', 'Van De Velde, Lee-Ann', 'Li, Yimei', 'Flynn, Patricia M', 'McCullers, Jonathan A']","['Hakim H', 'Allison KJ', 'Van De Velde LA', 'Li Y', 'Flynn PM', 'McCullers JA']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, United States.

Somatic mutation can either actively speed up the growth of tumour cells or relax the growth constraints normally imposed upon them, thereby conferring a selective (proliferative) advantage at the cellular level. Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) affects 1/3,000-4,000 individuals worldwide and is caused by the inactivation of the NF1 tumour suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Consistent with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, NF1 patients harbouring a heterozygous germline NF1 mutation develop neurofibromas upon somatic mutation of the second, wild-type, NF1 allele. While the identification of somatic mutations in NF1 patients has always been problematic on account of the extensive cellular heterogeneity manifested by neurofibromas, the classification of NF1 somatic mutations is a prerequisite for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 tumorigenesis. Here, the known somatic mutational spectrum for the NF1 gene in a range of NF1-associated neoplasms - including peripheral nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, gastric carcinoid, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, glomus tumours, astrocytomas and phaeochromocytomas - have been collated and analysed.","['Laycock-van Spyk, Sebastian', 'Thomas, Nick', 'Cooper, David N', 'Upadhyaya, Meena']","['Laycock-van Spyk S', 'Thomas N', 'Cooper DN', 'Upadhyaya M']","['Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,,IM,"['*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics/*pathology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['C06321321MV0675R [pii]', '10.1186/1479-7364-5-6-623 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Genomics. 2011 Oct;5(6):623-90. doi: 10.1186/1479-7364-5-6-623.,,PMC3525246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a prospective multicenter clinical trial using pretransplantation conditioning of thiotepa (5 mg/kg/day x 2), fludarabine (40 mg/mg/M(2)/day x 5), and total body radiation (800 cGy) plus thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg/day x 2), as well as a CD34 selected filgrastim stimulated peripheral blood graft from a partial matched URD, we treated 24 patients. The patients (median age 40 [range: 22-61]) were mismatched at 1-3 of 10 HLA loci with their donors; all were mismatched at HLA-C. Thirty-seven percent were ethnic or racial minorities. Twenty-one of 24 engrafted promptly with 1 primary graft failure and 2 early deaths. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (34%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 14-54%), chronic GVHD (20%, 95% CI, 2%-38%), and relapse (26%, 95% CI, 8%-84%) were unaffected by KIR ligand donor:recipient mismatch (n = 5) versus KIR ligand match (n = 19). Only 3 (12%) had grade III-IV GVHD. Nonrelapse occurred in 17% (95% CI, 30%-31%) by 100 days and in 35% (95% CI, 15%-55%) by 1 year. Two-year survival and leukemia-free survival were each 40% (95% CI, 21%-59%) and was similar in KIR ligand matched or mismatched patients. Infections, mostly in the first 2 months, were frequent, and were the cause of death in 5 patients (35% of deaths). T cell recovery and NK cell proliferation and functional maturation were not altered by KIR ligand match or mismatch status. For these high-risk patients, this high intensity regimen and T depleted approach yielded satisfactory outcomes, but logistical difficulties in arranging URD grafts for patients with high-risk, unstable leukemia limited accrual.

Recently, a reduced toxicity myeloablative regimen showed promising results, but the data of busulfan pharmacokinetics in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a targeted busulfan/fludarabine regimen in children has not yet been reported. We performed therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) after once-daily i.v. busulfan combined with fludarabine and analyzed the outcomes. Busulfan (i.v.) was administered once daily for 4 consecutive days. The daily target area under the curve (AUC) was 18,125-20,000 mug*h/L/day (4415-4872 mumol*min/L/day), which was reduced to 18,000-19,000 mug*h/L/day (4384-4628 mumol*min/L/day) after a high incidence of toxicity was observed. A total of 24 patients were enrolled. After infusion of busulfan on the first day, patients showed AUC that ranged from 12,079 to 31,660 mug*h/L (2942 to 7712 mumol*min/L) (median 16,824 mug*h/L, percent coefficient of variation (%CV) = 26.5%), with clearance of 1.74-6.94 mL/min/kg (median 4.03 mL/min/kg). We performed daily TDM in 20 patients, and during the daily TDM, the actual AUC ranged from 73% to 146% of the target AUC, showing high intraindividual variability. The %CV of busulfan clearance of each individual ranged from 7.7% to 38.7%. The total dose of busulfan administered for 4 days ranged from 287.3 mg/m(2) to 689.3 mg/m(2). Graft failure occurred in 3 patients with total AUC less than 74,000 mug*h/L (18,026 mumol*min/L), and 2 patients with relatively high total AUC experienced veno-occlusive disease. Busulfan pharmacokinetics showed high inter- and intraindividual variability in HSCT using a targeted busulfan/fludarabine regimen, which indicates the need for intensive monitoring and dose adjustment to improve the outcome of HSCT.

Six sulfated derivatives with degree of sulfation ranging from 0.68 to 1.91 were obtained. And the virus replication was inhibited by APS-1 at the dose of 10 and 30 mg/kg (26% and 30% inhibition respectively). Furthermore, both the percentage of CD4(+) cells and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in peripheral blood cells were significantly enhanced by APS-1 at 3-30 mg/kg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo studies to investigate the effects of two Astragalus saponins were carried out on the immune response cytokines by using six to eight weeks old male Swiss albino mice. The production of IL-1beta, TGF-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-gamma cytokines was determined by ELISA. The spleen and lymph nodes, isolated from the mice subjects, were analyzed to realize induction of the surface antigen productions for IL-2Ralpha (CD25) and CD69. In addition, their effects on the targets of inflammation such as NF kappaB, iNOS and NAG-1 were investigated in cell-based assays. RESULTS: The results suggested that AST VII and Mac B had positive effect on Th1 cytokine release (IL-2 and IFN-gamma), and suppression on Th2 cytokine production (IL-4). The immunohistochemical results exhibited induction of both IL-Ralpha (CD25) and CD69 surface receptors justifying the Th1 cytokine release. The compounds did not affect NF-kappaB or NAG-1 activity but iNOS activity was inhibited by Mac B with an IC(50) of 156 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that Ast VII and Mac B create powerful immunoregulatory effects without the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines in mice, and have no significant effect on the inflammatory cellular targets in vitro.","['Nalbantsoy, Ayse', 'Nesil, Tuna', 'Yilmaz-Dilsiz, Ozlem', 'Aksu, Guzide', 'Khan, Shabana', 'Bedir, Erdal']","['Nalbantsoy A', 'Nesil T', 'Yilmaz-Dilsiz O', 'Aksu G', 'Khan S', 'Bedir E']","['Ege University, Faculty of Engineering, Bioengineering Department, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gdf15 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)', '0 (Il2ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '511-64-8 (cycloartane)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', '*Astragalus Plant/chemistry', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15/genetics/metabolism', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*drug effects/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Factors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Saponins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Triterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00862-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.053 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2012 Jan 31;139(2):574-81. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.053.

However, genetic alteration of PML is rarely observed in these tumors; the exact mechanisms that mediate loss of PML function are not known. METHODS: We previously used a comprehensive shotgun mass spectrometry approach to identify PML as 1 of 70 proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with anti-T-cell factor 4 in DLD-1 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines; we investigated the effects of altered beta-catenin expression on PML function in these cells. RESULTS: beta-catenin specifically interacted with the product of PML transcript variant IV (PML-IV) through the armadillo repeat domain of beta-catenin. Overexpression of beta-catenin in colorectal cancer cells disrupted the subcellular compartmentalization of PML-IV, whereas knockdown of beta-catenin restored formation of PML-NB. Modification of PML by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is required for proper assembly of PML-NB. beta-catenin inhibited Ran-binding protein 2-mediated SUMOylation of PML-IV. CONCLUSIONS: beta-catenin interacts with PML isoform IV and disrupts PML-IV function and PML-NB formation by inhibiting Ran-binding protein 2-mediated SUMO modification of PML-IV. These findings indicate the involvement of a posttranslational mechanism in disruption of PML-NB organization in cancer cells and provide more information about the oncogenic functions of beta-catenin.","['Satow, Reiko', 'Shitashige, Miki', 'Jigami, Takafumi', 'Fukami, Kiyoko', 'Honda, Kazufumi', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Yamada, Tesshi']","['Satow R', 'Shitashige M', 'Jigami T', 'Fukami K', 'Honda K', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Yamada T']","['Division of Chemotherapy and Clinical Research, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111209,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (TCF4 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (ran-binding protein 2)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Interference', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factor 4', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/10 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5085(11)01639-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2011.11.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2012 Mar;142(3):572-81. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.11.041.

Drug selection of transgenic schistosomes would be desirable to provide a means to enrich for populations of transgenic worms. We adapted murine leukaemia retrovirus vectors - widely used in human gene therapy research - to transduce schistosomes, leading to integration of transgenes into the genome of the blood fluke. A dose-response kill curve and lethal G418 (geneticin) concentrations were established: 125-1,000mug/ml G418 were progressively more toxic for schistosomules of Schistosoma mansoni with toxicity increasing with antibiotic concentration and with duration of exposure. By day 6 of exposure to 500mug/ml, significantly fewer worms survived compared with non-exposed controls and by day 8, significantly fewer worms survived than controls at 250mug/ml G418. When schistosomules were transduced with murine leukaemia retrovirus encoding the neomycin resistance (neoR) transgene and cultured in media containing G418, the neoR transgene rescued transgenic schistosomules from the antibiotic; by day 4 in 1,000mug/ml and by day 8 in 500mug/ml G418, significantly more transgenic worms survived the toxic effects of the antibiotic. More copies of neoR were detected per nanogram of genomic DNA from populations of transgenic schistosomes cultured in G418 than from transgenic schistosomes cultured without G418. This trend was G418 dose-dependent, demonstrating enrichment of transgenic worms from among the schistosomules exposed to virions. Furthermore, higher expression of neoR was detected in transgenic schistosomes cultured in the presence of G418 than in transgenic worms cultured without antibiotic. The availability of antibiotic selection can be expected to enhance progress with functional genomics research on the helminth parasites responsible for major neglected tropical diseases.","['Rinaldi, Gabriel', 'Suttiprapa, Sutas', 'Tort, Jose F', 'Folley, Anne E', 'Skinner, Danielle E', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Rinaldi G', 'Suttiprapa S', 'Tort JF', 'Folley AE', 'Skinner DE', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine & Health Sciences, The George Washington University, 2300 I Street NW, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111129,England,Int J Parasitol,International journal for parasitology,0314024,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Gentamicins)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/chemistry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Gentamicins/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Biology/*methods', '*Organisms, Genetically Modified', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics', '*Selection, Genetic']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0020-7519(11)00280-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpara.2011.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Parasitol. 2012 Jan;42(1):123-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpara.2011.11.005.

These results demonstrate that DLI after lymphodepleting chemotherapy for relapsed hematologic malignancies results in frequent CRs.

The strengths and limitations for using the NCI60 database as a source of new anti-cancer agents are explored and discussed in relation to previous studies. We selected a sub-set of 2333 compounds with reliable experimental half maximum growth inhibitions (GI(50)) values for 30 cell lines from the NCI60 data set and evaluated their growth inhibitory effect (chemosensitivity) with respect to tissue of origin. This was done by identifying natural clusters in the chemosensitivity data set and in a data set of expression profiles of 1901 genes for the corresponding tumor cell lines. Five clusters were identified based on the gene expression data using self-organizing maps (SOM), comprising leukemia, melanoma, ovarian and prostate, basal breast, and luminal breast cancer cells, respectively. The strong difference in gene expression between basal and luminal breast cancer cells was reflected clearly in the chemosensitivity data. Although most compounds in the data set were of low potency, high efficacy compounds that showed specificity with respect to tissue of origin could be found. Furthermore, eight potential topoisomerase II inhibitors were identified using a structural similarity search. Finally, a set of genes with expression profiles that were significantly correlated with anti-cancer drug activity was identified.

To take maximum advantage of therapy with TKIs, compliance and good understanding of monitoring response to therapy are essential. We established a team that included a hematologist, a physician assistant (PA), and a nurse who work closely with a social worker, a pharmacist, and a research coordinator to assist patients throughout their journey with CML. The patient and the referring community oncologist were incorporated into this team. This coordinated team care approach takes advantage of each member's specific skills to provide patients with education about CML, encourage patients' strong involvement in tracking/monitoring results/response to therapy, and support patients with issues that arise throughout the long course of the disease. A low rate of noncompliance with clinic visits (3%) was an indirect measure of the impact of this approach. The inclusion of the referring oncologist in the team extended the tracking of monitoring results to the community practice. We conclude that a coordinated team care approach is feasible in the management of patients with CML. This approach provided patients with education and a good understanding of response to therapy and improved relations with the health care team.","['Holloway, Stacie', 'Lord, Katharine', 'Bethelmie-Bryan, Beverly', 'Shepard, Marian W', 'Neely, Jessica', 'McLemore, Morgan', 'Reddy, Satyanarayan K', 'Montero, Aldemar', 'Jonas, William S', 'Gladney, Sara Pierson', 'Khanwani, Shyam L', 'Reddy, Silpa C', 'Lahiry, Anup K', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Winton, Elliott', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean']","['Holloway S', 'Lord K', 'Bethelmie-Bryan B', 'Shepard MW', 'Neely J', 'McLemore M', 'Reddy SK', 'Montero A', 'Jonas WS', 'Gladney SP', 'Khanwani SL', 'Reddy SC', 'Lahiry AK', 'Heffner LT', 'Winton E', 'Arellano M', 'Khoury HJ']","['Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111208,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,IM,"['*Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/nursing', '*Patient Care Team', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00580-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Apr;12(2):88-93. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.004.

The molecular basis of this crosstalk is poorly understood and relies, in part, on ""dual-function"" proteins that operate in both processes. Here, we identify the essential autophagy protein Atg12 as a positive mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis and show that Atg12 directly regulates the apoptotic pathway by binding and inactivating prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The binding occurs independently of Atg5 or Atg3 and requires a unique BH3-like motif in Atg12, characterized by interaction studies and computational docking. In apoptotic cells, knockdown of Atg12 inhibited Bax activation and cytochrome c release, while ectopic expression of Atg12 antagonized the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1. The interaction between Atg12 and Bcl-2 family members may thus constitute an important point of convergence between autophagy and apoptosis in response to specific signals.","['Rubinstein, Assaf D', 'Eisenstein, Miriam', 'Ber, Yaara', 'Bialik, Shani', 'Kimchi, Adi']","['Rubinstein AD', 'Eisenstein M', 'Ber Y', 'Bialik S', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (ATG12 protein, human)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 12)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 12', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(11)00890-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2011 Dec 9;44(5):698-709. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.014.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Based on data from European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), an analysis of the quality of these studies, which serve as the basis of marketing authorisation of currently approved drugs, is showing improvement. For example, endpoints recommended by the EMA are frequently used. However, deficits of marketing authorisation studies are still noticeable, e. g., results based on unplanned interim analyses or post hoc subgroup analyses. In addition to the improved quality of studies prior to marketing authorisation, independent clinical studies need to be conducted after marketing authorisation has been obtained, a good example of which are therapy optimisation studies (TOS) in acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL). A goal of TOS is the examination of multimodal therapy concepts in the real world context of routine clinical practice. They can supply valuable data for drug safety and long-term observation. In order to conduct post-marketing authorisation studies, funding is required and bureaucratic hurdles associated with the 12(th) amendment to the Pharmaceutical Act will have to be reduced.

The production of Albumin (Alb) was measured by luciferase activity at day 4, 7, 10 and 14. RESULTS: PAS staining assay revealed that BMP2 and BMP9 enhanced glycogen storage in hepatic progenitor cells most obviously at day 7. The percentages of positive cells were 30% and 45% respectively at 7 days post-infection. Meanwhile, 40% and 30% cells were positive by ICG uptake assay after BMP2 and BMP9 induction. Luciferase activity indicated that BMP9 induced ALB-Luc activity most significantly at day 7. However, less inductive activity was found in LIF-treated group.

C57BL/6J mice were fed with high fat, methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks to induce fibrotic steatohepatitis. Mice fed the MCD diet were treated with adenovirus carrying PPARg (Ad-PPARg), adenovirus-beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ), Ad-PPARg plus PPARg agonist rosiglitazone, or PPARg antagonist 2-chloro-5-nitro- benzanilide (GW9662), respectively. H and E stain was performed for observation of hepatocellular apoptosis, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in the liver sections. The expression levels of mRNA and protein of PPARg and apoptosis related genes, Fas, Fas Ligand (FasL), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases-3 (caspase-3) were detected by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. RESULTS: Mice fed with MCD diet for 8 weeks showed severe hepatic injury including steatosis, hepatocellular apoptosis, inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis, concomitancy with enhanced expression of pro-apoptosis genes, Fas, FasL, Bax and caspase-3 and increased expression of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2, by comparing with the control group.

Administration of PPARg agonist rosiglitazone and/or Ad-PPARg significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular apoptosis, necro inflammation and fibrosis. These effects were associated with repressed expression of pro-apoptosis genes and up-regulated expression of anti-apoptosis gene.

METHODS: An an area under the curve partitioned survival model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib. Clinical effectiveness evidence was taken mostly from single-arm trials. RESULTS: Both progression-free survival and overall survival are highly uncertain. In the base case, patients take nilotinib for much less time than dasatinib. Nilotinib is expected to dominate high-dose imatinib, yielding slightly more (0.32) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at slightly less cost ( pound11,100 [pound sterling]) per person. Dasatinib is predicted to provide slightly more (0.53) QALYs at substantially greater cost ( pound48,900), yielding a very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound91,500 QALY against high-dose imatinib. Cost-effectiveness, however, changes radically under the plausible assumption that the drugs are taken for the same time. For people intolerant to imatinib, nilotinib is expected to yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound104,700/QALY, and dasatinib pound82,600/QALY compared with interferon-alpha. Further, both drugs represent poor value for money for a range of plausible structural assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The model should be viewed as an exploratory analysis of the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib because it relies on many assumptions. Whilst clinical data remains immature, the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib for imatinib-resistant people is highly uncertain. Both nilotinib and dasatinib are highly unlikely to be cost-effective versus interferon-alpha for people intolerant to imatinib.","['Hoyle, Martin', 'Rogers, Gabriel', 'Moxham, Tiffany', 'Liu, Zulian', 'Stein, Ken']","['Hoyle M', 'Rogers G', 'Moxham T', 'Liu Z', 'Stein K']","['Peninsular College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom. martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzamides', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/economics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/economics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1098-3015(11)01549-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jval.2011.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2011 Dec;14(8):1057-67. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2011.07.006.

Recently, it has been proposed that XMRV is a laboratory contaminant and may have originated via a rare recombination event. Host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G) has been reported to severely restrict XMRV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, XMRV infects and replicates efficiently in prostate cancer cells of epithelial origin. It has been proposed that due to lack off or very low levels of A3G protein XMRV is able to productively replicate in these cells. FINDINGS: This report builds on and challenges the published data on the absence of A3G protein in prostate epithelial cells lines. We demonstrate the presence of A3G in prostate epithelial cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) by western blot and mass spectrometry. We believe the discrepancy in A3G detection is may be due to selection and sensitivity of A3G antibodies employed in the prior studies. Our results also indicate that XMRV produced from A3G expressing LNCaP cells can infect and replicate in target cells. Most importantly our data reveal downregulation of A3G in XMRV infected LNCaP and DU145 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that XMRV replicates efficiently in prostate epithelial cells by downregulating A3G expression. Given that XMRV lacks accessory proteins such as HIV-1 Vif that are known to counteract A3G function in human cells, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which retroviruses can counteract the antiviral effects of A3G proteins.","['Dey, Abhinav', 'Mantri, Chinmay Kumar', 'Pandhare-Dash, Jui', 'Liu, Bindong', 'Pratap, Siddharth', 'Dash, Chandravanu']","['Dey A', 'Mantri CK', 'Pandhare-Dash J', 'Liu B', 'Pratap S', 'Dash C']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology and Epigenetics, Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Vanderbilt-Meharry Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, 1050 Dr. D B Todd Jr. Blvd., Nashville TN 37208, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Expression', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prostate/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*physiology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-531 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-531 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Dec 12;8:531. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-531.,"['K99 DA024558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R00DA024558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024975/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA033892/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA030896/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'U54RR026140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD007593/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R03DA30896/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 DA024558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR026140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3268770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fungal infection remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality and is considered an obstacle to the successful management of acute leukaemias. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all patients treated for acute leukaemias at a single institution between July 2006 and January 2009, to assess the impact of early antifungal therapy on outcome during induction chemotherapy. There were 44 episodes of induction chemotherapy, with a median age of patients of 61 years (range 18-81), including 29 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, 9 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 6 with relapsed AL. The median age was 61 years (range 18-81), and 20 patients were over the age of 60 years. RESULTS: All patients who developed febrile neutropenia received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early empirical antifungal treatment was commenced with voriconazole (15 patients) or caspofungin (12 patients) if the febrile neutropenia did not resolve after 72 h of antibiotic therapy, in conjunction with radiological changes consistent with possible fungal infection. None of the patients succumbed during induction chemotherapy. The 120-day mortality rate after the induction therapy was 2.2%, without any incidence of invasive fungal disease. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that early empirical treatment for fungal infection with voriconazole or caspofungin is associated with a favourable outcome of induction therapy for acute leukaemias. Further studies to confirm this finding are warranted.","['Khalafallah, A', 'Maiwald, M', 'Hannan, T', 'Abell, S', 'Staker, J', 'Supperamohan, A']","['Khalafallah A', 'Maiwald M', 'Hannan T', 'Abell S', 'Staker J', 'Supperamohan A']","['Department of Haematology, Launceston General Hospital, Australia. khalafallah@dhhs.tas.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Fever/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02638.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2012 Feb;42(2):131-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02638.x.,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

ATL is often associated with general immune suppression and an impaired HTLV-1-specific T-cell response, an important host defense system. We previously found that a small fraction of asymptomatic HTLV-1-carriers (AC) already showed impaired T-cell responses against the major target antigen, Tax. However, it is unclear whether the impaired HTLV-1 Tax-specific T-cell response in these individuals is an HTLV-1-specific phenomenon, or merely reflects general immune suppression. In this study, in order to characterize the impaired HTLV-1-specific T-cell response, we investigated the function of Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells in various clinical status of HTLV-1 infection. RESULTS: By using tetramers consisting of HLA-A*0201, -A*2402, or -A*1101, and corresponding Tax epitope peptides, we detected Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells in the peripheral blood from 87.0% of ACs (n = 20/23) and 100% of HAM/TSP patients (n = 18/18) tested. We also detected Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells in 38.1% of chronic type ATL (cATL) patients (n = 8/21), although its frequencies in peripheral blood CD8+ T cells were significantly lower than those of ACs or HAM/TSP patients. Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells detected in HAM/TSP patients proliferated well in culture and produced IFN-gamma when stimulated with Tax peptides. However, such functions were severely impaired in the Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells detected in cATL patients. In ACs, the responses of Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells were retained in most cases. However, we found one AC sample whose Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells hardly produced IFN-gamma, and failed to proliferate and express activation (CD69) and degranulation (CD107a) markers in response to Tax peptide. Importantly, the same AC sample contained cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65-specific CD8+ T-cells that possessed functions upon CMV pp65 peptide stimulation. We further examined additional samples of two smoldering type ATL patients and found that they also showed dysfunctions of Tax-specific but not CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells were scarce and dysfunctional not only in ATL patients but also in a limited AC population, and that the dysfunction was selective for HTLV-1-specifc CD8+ T-cells in early stages.","['Takamori, Ayako', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Tamai, Yotaro', 'Sasada, Amane', 'Zeng, Na', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Takamori A', 'Hasegawa A', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Maeda Y', 'Yamano Y', 'Masuda M', 'Shimizu Y', 'Tamai Y', 'Sasada A', 'Zeng N', 'Choi I', 'Uike N', 'Okamura J', 'Watanabe T', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (cytomegalovirus matrix protein 65kDa)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Asymptomatic Infections', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/metabolism', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/virology', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/immunology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-100 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-100 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Dec 7;8:100. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-100.,,PMC3261825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zeta-associated protein of 70 kD is ordinarily expressed in T cells where it has a crucial role in T-cell receptor signalling, whereas its aberrant expression in CLL leads to enhanced B-cell receptor signalling and significantly more aggressive disease course. Although much is known about the activation of ZAP70 following engagement of T-cell receptor, there are little data on the regulation of ZAP70 gene expression in normal T cells or CLL. To understand the molecular events underpinning epigenetic regulation of ZAP70 gene in CLL, we have defined ZAP70 promoter region and outlined the regions crucial in regulating the gene activity. Following a direct comparison of ZAP70+ and ZAP70- primary CLLs, we show ZAP70 promoter in expressing CLLs to be associated with a spectrum of active histone modifications, some of which are tightly linked to aberrant DNA methylation in CLL. Cross-talk between histone modifications and reduced DNA methylation culminates in transcriptional de-repression of ZAP70. Moreover, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methylation inhibitors results in recovery of ZAP70 expression, which provides a possible explanation for the failure of HDAC inhibitors in CLL treatment and might serve as a cautionary warning for their future use in treatment of this leukaemia.","['Amin, Shilu', 'Walsh, Meagan', 'Wilson, Caroline', 'Parker, Anton E', 'Oscier, David', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Mann, Derek', 'Mann, Jelena']","['Amin S', 'Walsh M', 'Wilson C', 'Parker AE', 'Oscier D', 'Willmore E', 'Mann D', 'Mann J']","['Faculty of Medical Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01503.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2012 Sep;16(9):2074-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01503.x.,,PMC3822977,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that BCR-ABL is the specific target of Gleevec in CML treatment, we investigated the regulation of the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, by BCR-ABL at multiple levels in K562 cells. METHODS: Molecular techniques such as over expression, knockdown, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, reporter assay, confocal microscopy, telomerase assays and microarray were used to suggest that hTERT expression and activity is modulated by BCR-ABL at multiple levels. RESULTS: Our results suggest that BCR-ABL plays an important role in regulating hTERT in K562 (BCR-ABL positive human leukemia) cells. When Gleevec inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, phosphorylation of hTERT was downregulated, therefore suggesting a positive correlation between BCR-ABL and hTERT. Gleevec treatment inhibited hTERT at mRNA level and significantly reduced telomerase activity (TA) in K562 cells, but not in HL60 or Jurkat cells (BCR-ABL negative cells). We also demonstrated that the transcription factor STAT5a plays a critical role in hTERT gene regulation in K562 cells. Knockdown of STAT5a, but not STAT5b, resulted in a marked downregulation of hTERT mRNA level, TA and hTERT protein level in K562 cells. Furthermore, translocation of hTERT from nucleoli to nucleoplasm was observed in K562 cells induced by Gleevec. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that BCR-ABL can regulate TA at multiple levels, including transcription, post-translational level, and proper localization. Thus, suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by Gleevec treatment may be partially due to TA inhibition. Additionally, we have identified STAT5a as critical mediator of the hTERT gene expression in BCR-ABL positive CML cells, suggesting that targeting STAT5a may be a promising therapeutic strategy for BCR-ABL positive CML patients.","['Chai, Juin Hsien', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Tan, Wei Han', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Li, Baojie', 'Wang, Xueying']","['Chai JH', 'Zhang Y', 'Tan WH', 'Chng WJ', 'Li B', 'Wang X']","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 8 Medical Drive, 117597 Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111209,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-512 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-512 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Dec 9;11:512. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-512.,,PMC3259104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies providing long-term outcome for these patients are scarce. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed outcomes and rates of successful discharge of 111 consecutive critically ill cancer patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in 2008 and identified factors influencing these results. RESULTS: ICU mortality was 32% and hospital mortality was 41%. None of the characteristics of the malignancy nor age or neutropenia were significantly different between survivors and others. Two variables were independently associated with ICU mortality: high Logistic Organ Dysfunction score on day 7 and a diagnosis of viral infection and/or reactivation. The 1-year mortality rate for ICU survivors was 58% and was significantly lower in patients with a diagnosis of acute leukemia or multiple myeloma. CONCLUSION: Organ failure scores on day 7 can predict outcome for cancer patients in the ICU. Viral infection and reactivation appear to worsen the prognosis.

The most convincing example is the graft versus leukaemia effect observed after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the autologous setting, however, the isolation and expansion of naturally occurring tumour-specific T cells is a challenging task. Cancer antigens are often self-antigens and cancer-specific T cells are thus subject to selective mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. The significant advances in gene-transfer technologies developed over the last decade have offered new tools to overcome these limitations. Natural T cells can be genetically modified to generate high numbers of 'supernatural' tumour-reactive T cells from virtually every cancer patient. Supernatural T cells may express clonal receptors providing new specificities, factors increasing T-cell performance or safety factors enabling their elimination in case of toxicity. Technological improvements applied to novel concepts of T-cell biology and oncogenesis will allow to simultaneously equip T cells with different transgenes and expand a real 'army' of lymphocytes trained to selectively eradicate cancer cells.","['Casucci, M', 'Bondanza, A', 'Falcone, L', 'Provasi, E', 'Magnani, Z', 'Bonini, C']","['Casucci M', 'Bondanza A', 'Falcone L', 'Provasi E', 'Magnani Z', 'Bonini C']","['Experimental Haematology Laboratory, PIBIC, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Gene Therapy, S.

The function of Gadd45 as a stress sensor is mediated via a complex interplay of physical interactions with other cellular proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation and the response of cells to stress, notably PCNA, p21, cdc2/cyclinB1, and the p38 and JNK stress response kinases. Altered expression of Gadd45 has been observed in multiple types of solid tumors as well as in hematopoietic malignancies.

It is of particular interest to stem cell biologists because it is linked to the self-renewal of both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and it is involved in human leukemia. In ESCs, the Sall4/Oct4/Nanog core transcriptional network governs the self-renewal and pluripotent properties of human and murine ESCs. In normal HSCs and leukemic stem cells (LSCs), SALL4 is linked to three known pathways that are involved in self-renewal: Wnt/beta-catenin, Bmi-1, and Pten. Despite the important shared role of SALL4 in self-renewal of HSCs and LSCs, our recent studies obtained through correlating global downstream target genes and unique functional studies in normal versus leukemic cells have demonstrated that SALL4 has differential effects on both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways in normal and leukemic cells. Targeting SALL4, particularly when combined with the use of ABT-737, a BCL2 antagonist, could lead to leukemic cell-specific apoptosis. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the SALL gene family development, particularly on the role of SALL4 in stem cells, as well as tumorigenesis, especially leukemogenesis.","['Gao, Chong', 'Kong, Nikki R', 'Chai, Li']","['Gao C', 'Kong NR', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,"['0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['049e8a5e62fb019e,244083b95623b644 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i1-2.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2011;16(1-2):117-27. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i1-2.110.,"['P01 DK080665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092437-01A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092437-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092437/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK080665-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL092437/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HL095489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL095489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL092437-A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL095489-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01DK080665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3238789,,['NIHMS326974'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, 10-15% of patients with AML with intermediate risk cytogenetics are characterized by mutations of the CEBPA gene. Two classes of mutations are described. N-terminal changes result in expression of a truncated dominant negative C/EBPalphap30 isoform. C-terminal mutations are in-frame insertions or deletions resulting in alteration of the leucine zipper preventing dimerization and DNA binding. Often, patients carry both N- and C-terminal mutations each affecting a different allele, and a mouse model recapitulates the human phenotype.

Identification of recurring chromosomal translocations provides some prognostic information for individual AML subjects. Population based gene-expression profiling studies also identified abnormalities relevant to prognosis. Such studies associate increased expression of a set of homeodomain transcription factors with poor prognosis in AML. This set includes HoxB3, B4, A7-11 and Meis1, which are dysregulated as a group in the bone marrow in poor prognosis AML. Aberrant expression of these homeodomain transcription factors is found in AML with chromosomal translocations involving the MLL, MYST3 and CREBBP genes, and in a poor prognosis subset with normal cytogenetics. Studies in murine models suggest that Hox protein overexpression is functionally significant for myeloid malignancies. Overexpression of individual Hox proteins expanded various bone marrow populations in vitro, leading to myeloproliferation and in some cases differentiation block and AML in vivo. Therefore, dysregulated expression of key Hox target genes may contribute to adverse prognosis in AML. Identification of these genes will provide insights into the pathobiology of prognosis in AML.

However, current treatments are largely ineffective against relapsed leukemia and, in the case of pediatric patients, are often associated with severe long-term toxicities. Thus, there continues to be a critical need for the development of effective biologically targeted therapies. The TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases-Tyro3, Axl, and Mer-plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis, including natural killer cell maturation, macrophage function, and platelet activation and signaling. Furthermore, TAM receptor activation leads to upregulation of pro-survival and proliferation signaling pathways, and aberrant TAM receptor expression contributes to cancer development, including myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. This review summarizes the role of TAM receptors in leukemia. We outline TAM receptor expression patterns in different forms of leukemia, describe potential mechanisms leading to their overexpression, and delineate the signaling pathways downstream of receptor activation that have been implicated in leukemogenesis. Finally, we discuss the current research focused on inhibitors against these receptors in an effort to develop new therapeutic strategies for leukemia.","['Brandao, Luis', 'Migdall-Wilson, Justine', 'Eisenman, Kristen', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Brandao L', 'Migdall-Wilson J', 'Eisenman K', 'Graham DK']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/therapy', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['049e8a5e62fb019e,305b0e1923e5c7e0 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i1-2.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2011;16(1-2):47-63. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i1-2.60.,"['F32 HL096416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA137078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32HL096416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4855299,,['NIHMS492406'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, a number of transcription factors that appear to play a central role in leukemogenesis are being investigated; among them is the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a transcription factor that can regulate downstream targets involving in various cellular functions including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. In several studies, the majority of bone marrow samples from patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia demonstrate CREB overexpression.

Non-nodal leukaemic MCLs display a peculiar clinical presentation, with distinctive biological features, such as mutated IGHV and a transcriptional profile lacking tumour invasion properties, that might contribute to the absence of nodal involvement and to the less aggressive clinical course.","['Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Messina, Monica', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Nanni, Mauro', 'Pescarmona, Edoardo', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Pulsoni, Alessandro', 'Martelli, Maurizio', 'Di Rocco, Alice', 'Finolezzi, Erica', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Del Giudice I', 'Messina M', 'Chiaretti S', 'Santangelo S', 'Tavolaro S', 'De Propris MS', 'Nanni M', 'Pescarmona E', 'Mancini F', 'Pulsoni A', 'Martelli M', 'Di Rocco A', 'Finolezzi E', 'Paoloni F', 'Mauro FR', 'Cuneo A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111208,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Actin Cytoskeleton/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08962.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Mar;156(5):601-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08962.x.

HSPs are regarded as possible therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We used bioinformatical approaches to characterize the HSP profile in AML cells from 75 consecutive patients, in addition to the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. Patients harbouring a FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) were extensively overrepresented in the cluster with high HSP levels, indicating a strong dependence of HSPs in stabilizing FLT3-ITD encoded oncoproteins. FLT3 ligation further increased the levels of HSP90 and its co-chaperone HSP70. HSP90 inhibition had a stronger pro-apoptotic effect for AML cells with FLT3-ITD than for cells with wild-type FLT3, whereas the anti-proliferative effect of HSP90 inhibition was similar for the two patient subsets. HSP90 inhibition altered the constitutive cytokine release profile in an anti-angiogenic direction independent of FLT3 mutational status: (i) pro-angiogenic CXCL8, MMP-2 and MMP-9 showed a stronger decrease than anti-angiogenic CXCL9-11, (ii) the Tie-2 agonist Ang-1 showed a stronger decrease than the potentially antagonistic Ang-2, and (iii) VEGF and HGF levels were decreased. Finally, HSP90 inhibition counteracted the leukaemia-stimulating effect of endothelial cells. Our studies demonstrate that HSP90 inhibition mediates anti-leukaemic effects through both direct and indirect activity.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hatfield, Kimberley J', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Petersen, Kjell', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Ersvaer E', 'Hovland R', 'Skavland J', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Petersen K', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Haematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08960.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Feb;156(4):468-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08960.x.

METHODS: We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS: Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Wang, Lili', 'Lawrence, Michael S', 'Wan, Youzhong', 'Stojanov, Petar', 'Sougnez, Carrie', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Werner, Lillian', 'Sivachenko, Andrey', 'DeLuca, David S', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Vartanov, Alexander R', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Goldstein, Natalie R', 'Folco, Eric G', 'Cibulskis, Kristian', 'Tesar, Bethany', 'Sievers, Quinlan L', 'Shefler, Erica', 'Gabriel, Stacey', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Reed, Robin', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Lander, Eric S', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Getz, Gad', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Wang L', 'Lawrence MS', 'Wan Y', 'Stojanov P', 'Sougnez C', 'Stevenson K', 'Werner L', 'Sivachenko A', 'DeLuca DS', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang W', 'Vartanov AR', 'Fernandes SM', 'Goldstein NR', 'Folco EG', 'Cibulskis K', 'Tesar B', 'Sievers QL', 'Shefler E', 'Gabriel S', 'Hacohen N', 'Reed R', 'Meyerson M', 'Golub TR', 'Lander ES', 'Neuberg D', 'Brown JR', 'Getz G', 'Wu CJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center and the Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Exome/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'RNA Splicing', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1056/NEJMoa1109016 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2011 Dec 29;365(26):2497-506. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1109016.

In the present investigation, the detection sensitivity of RBL-2H3 assay was elevated by modifying the experiment protocols from choosing the proper releasing medium and optimizing the sensitization manner. The polyclonal antibody was generated from Brown Norway (BN) rats exposed to Ovalbumin (OVA). In contrast to Tyrode buffer A, RBL-2H3 cells cultured in DMEM had a lower spontaneous secretion and a higher response to antigen stimulation, both of which could help to increase the detection sensitivity. The rat sera used in the sensitization process should be diluted appropriately to avoid the proliferation-promoting effect on RBL-2H3 cells. The results of the kinetics of sensitization showed that prolonging the sensitization time and then reculturing the cells in IgE free medium for a further 24 h after the removal of rat sera could reach a marked increase in the degree of sensitization. The highest anti-OVA antibody titer detected by the modified RBL-2H3 assay was 4096, while PCA assay was 1024. These data provide evidence that the modified RBL-2H3 mediator release assay has a promising prospect in the determination of the biologic activity of polyclonal antibody.","['Qin, Hui-Di', 'Liu, Zhao-Hua', 'Liu, Zhao-Ping']","['Qin HD', 'Liu ZH', 'Liu ZP']","['Center for New Drugs Evaluation, Shandong University, Jinan, PR China. qinhuidi@sina.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111212,England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,"['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Immunoglobulin E/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15376516.2011.599884 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2012 Feb;22(2):105-10. doi: 10.3109/15376516.2011.599884.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was applied in 88 cases of HSCT using TBI as pretreatment from March 2001 to June 2009 in our hospital. Using 8 MV X-ray, all the patients were irradiated by linear accelerator in 2 consecutive days, with a total dose of 7-11 Gy and an instantaneous dose rate ranging between 4.0 and 5.0 cGy/min. Of the 88 cases, 40 cases were given traditional high-dose chemotherapy before TBI (Group CT/TBI), and 48 cases were given TBI before chemotherapy (Group TBI/CT) instead. RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases of transplantation were successful, with no serious complications, including radiation pneumonia. Compared with Group CT/TBI, Group TBI/CT showed similar incidence of complications (p=0.08), similar recent chemotherapy toxicity (p=0.833), and significantly lower recent radiation toxicity (p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: TBI in the pretreatment of HSCT is safe and effective. Using TBI before the high-dose chemotherapy can maintain the same pretreatment effect, effectively reduce apparent immediate reaction/discomfort during TBI, reduce preparation workload of radiotherapy, and lower radiation side-effects.

Twenty patients received clofarabine (10, 20 or 30 mg/m(2)) on days 1-5, with GO 3 mg/m(2)/day on days 1, 4 and 7. Common dose-limiting toxicities were prolonged myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity.

The aim of this review is to highlight the pitfalls and possible solutions for comparing efficacy across disparate CML trials. Comparison of efficacy across trials is aided by careful consideration of possible confounding factors, including treatment history, definitions of imatinib intolerance or resistance, and BCR-ABL mutational status at baseline.

METHODS: Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 60) were randomly assigned to five groups. Group A received normal partial oxygen pressure and groups B, C, D, and E received 75% +/- 2% oxygen for 5 days to induce ROP. The rats in groups C, D, and E were intragastrically treated with resveratrol (10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/d, respectively) once daily for 5 days. Rats were killed at 17 days of age and the retina was collected. RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed increased Bcl-2 protein expression in group B versus group A. Levels of Bcl-2 decreased with the increase of resveratrol concentration in groups C, D, and E. The optical density of Bcl-2 protein expression in group B was four times higher than that in group A (P < .01). When compared with group B, expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF in groups C, D, and E decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Significant differences in expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF were also noted among the three treatment groups with resveratrol (P < .01). After treatment with resveratrol at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/d, the inhibition rate of Bcl-2 expression was 11.1%, 38.1%, and 69.8% and that of VEGF expression was 3.4%, 23.0%, and 43.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol can significantly inhibit expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF in the retina of neonatal rats with oxygen-induced ROP. It may provide a protective effect on retinal neovascular diseases, including ROP.","['Li, Wenlin', 'Jiang, Deyong']","['Li W', 'Jiang D']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 7019# Yitian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen, China. wenlinli6688@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,United States,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus,Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus,7901143,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, rat)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Oxygen/toxicity', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Resveratrol', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity/chemically induced/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Stilbenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01913913-20111129-01 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2012 Jul-Aug;49(4):230-5. doi: 10.3928/01913913-20111129-01.

Unlike STAT3, where significant medicinal effort has been expended to identify potent direct inhibitors, Stat5 has been poorly investigated as a molecular therapeutic target. Thus, in an effort to identify direct inhibitors of STAT5 protein, we conducted an in vitro screen of a focused library of SH2 domain binding salicylic acid-containing inhibitors ( approximately 150) against STAT5, as well as against STAT3 and STAT1 proteins for SH2 domain selectivity. We herein report the identification of several potent (K(i) < 5 muM) and STAT5 selective (>3-fold specificity for STAT5 cf. STAT1 and STAT3) inhibitors, BP-1-107, BP-1-108, SF-1-087, and SF-1-088. Lead agents, evaluated in K562 and MV-4-11 human leukemia cells, showed potent induction of apoptosis (IC(50)'s approximately 20 muM) which correlated with potent and selective suppression of STAT5 phosphorylation, as well as inhibition of STAT5 target genes cyclin D1, cyclin D2, C-MYC, and MCL-1. Moreover, lead agent BP-1-108 showed negligible cytotoxic effects in normal bone marrow cells not expressing activated STAT5 protein.

At higher concentrations (1 and 2 muM), the response shifted to apoptosis, which was consistent with the effect of AM6-36 on other apoptotic signatures including an increase of apoptotic annexin V(+) 7-AAD(-) cells, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and activation of several caspases. These apoptotic effects are potentially due to up-regulation of p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation and down-regulation of c-Myc oncogene expression. Taken together, AM6-36 might serve as an effective anticancer agent by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the activation of MAPKs and inhibition of c-Myc.","['Park, Eun-Jung', 'Kiselev, Evgeny', 'Conda-Sheridan, Martin', 'Cushman, Mark', 'Pezzuto, John M']","['Park EJ', 'Kiselev E', 'Conda-Sheridan M', 'Cushman M', 'Pezzuto JM']","['College of Pharmacy, University of Hawaii at Hilo, Hilo, Hawaii 96720, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111207,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0', '(3-amino-6-(3-aminopropyl)-5,6-dihydro-5,11-dioxo-11H-indeno(1,2-c)isoquinoline)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Isoquinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Retinoid X Receptors/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2011/12/14 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np200791j [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2012 Mar 23;75(3):378-84. doi: 10.1021/np200791j.

Here, we describe a previously unreported MDS family carrying a missense GATA2 mutation (p.Thr354Met), one patient with MDS/AML carrying a frameshift GATA2 mutation (p.Leu332Thrfs*53), another with MDS harboring a GATA2 splice site mutation, and 3 patients exhibiting MDS or MDS/AML who have large deletions encompassing the GATA2 locus. Intriguingly, 2 MDS/AML or ""MonoMAC"" syndrome patients with GATA2 deletions and one with a frameshift mutation also have primary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema occurs as a result of aberrations in the development and/or function of lymphatic vessels, spurring us to investigate whether GATA2 plays a role in the lymphatic vasculature. We demonstrate here that GATA2 protein is present at high levels in lymphatic vessel valves and that GATA2 controls the expression of genes important for programming lymphatic valve development. Our data expand the phenotypes associated with germline GATA2 mutations to include predisposition to primary lymphedema and suggest that complete haploinsufficiency or loss of function of GATA2, rather than missense mutations, is the key predisposing factor for lymphedema onset. Moreover, we reveal a crucial role for GATA2 in lymphatic vascular development.","['Kazenwadel, Jan', 'Secker, Genevieve A', 'Liu, Yajuan J', 'Rosenfeld, Jill A', 'Wildin, Robert S', 'Cuellar-Rodriguez, Jennifer', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Dyack, Sarah', 'Fernandez, Conrad V', 'Chong, Chan-Eng', 'Babic, Milena', 'Bardy, Peter G', 'Shimamura, Akiko', 'Zhang, Michael Y', 'Walsh, Tom', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Horwitz, Marshall S', 'Hahn, Christopher N', 'Scott, Hamish S', 'Harvey, Natasha L']","['Kazenwadel J', 'Secker GA', 'Liu YJ', 'Rosenfeld JA', 'Wildin RS', 'Cuellar-Rodriguez J', 'Hsu AP', 'Dyack S', 'Fernandez CV', 'Chong CE', 'Babic M', 'Bardy PG', 'Shimamura A', 'Zhang MY', 'Walsh T', 'Holland SM', 'Hickstein DD', 'Horwitz MS', 'Hahn CN', 'Scott HS', 'Harvey NL']","['Division of Haematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, 5000 SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Germ-Line Mutation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lymphangiogenesis/genetics', 'Lymphatic Vessels/*metabolism', 'Lymphedema/*congenital/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Syndrome', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46156-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-374363 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 2;119(5):1283-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-374363.

Inter-individual variation in clearance of methotrexate results in heterogeneous systemic exposure, clinical efficacy, and toxicity. In a genome-wide association study of children with ALL, we identified SLCO1B1 as harboring multiple common polymorphisms associated with methotrexate clearance. The extent of influence of rare versus common variants on pharmacogenomic phenotypes remains largely unexplored. We tested the hypothesis that rare variants in SLCO1B1 could affect methotrexate clearance and compared the influence of common versus rare variants in addition to clinical covariates on clearance. From deep resequencing of SLCO1B1 exons in 699 children, we identified 93 SNPs, 15 of which were non-synonymous (NS). Three of these NS SNPs were common, with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%, one had low frequency (MAF 1%-5%), and 11 were rare (MAF <1%). NS SNPs (common or rare) predicted to be functionally damaging were more likely to be found among patients with the lowest methotrexate clearance than patients with high clearance. We verified lower function in vitro of four SLCO1B1 haplotypes that were associated with reduced methotrexate clearance. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis adjusting for other genetic and non-genetic covariates, SLCO1B1 variants accounted for 10.7% of the population variability in clearance. Of that variability, common NS variants accounted for the majority, but rare damaging NS variants constituted 17.8% of SLCO1B1's effects (1.9% of total variation) and had larger effect sizes than common NS variants. Our results show that rare variants are likely to have an important effect on pharmacogenetic phenotypes.","['Ramsey, Laura B', 'Bruun, Gitte H', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Trevino, Lisa R', 'Vattathil, Selina', 'Scheet, Paul', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Giacomini, Kathleen M', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Mikkelsen, Torben S', 'Corydon, Thomas J', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Ramsey LB', 'Bruun GH', 'Yang W', 'Trevino LR', 'Vattathil S', 'Scheet P', 'Cheng C', 'Rosner GL', 'Giacomini KM', 'Fan Y', 'Sparreboom A', 'Mikkelsen TS', 'Corydon TJ', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', '*Exons', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.129668.111 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.129668.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2012 Jan;22(1):1-8. doi: 10.1101/gr.129668.111.

It was rediscovered in western medicine and enjoyed a renaissance from 1830 to 1930, as the first effective chemotherapy against syphilis, parasites and leukaemia. These years were also a time of political turmoil in China. The Nanking treaty (29 August 1842) turned Hong Kong into a colony, while the Xinhai Revolution (10 October 1911) gave birth to a republic of China. Arsenic returned to China and Hong Kong with the establishment of the first medical schools from 1887 to 1920. Until 1950, oral arsenic trioxide was the standard anti-leukaemic treatment in Queen Mary Hospital. The advent of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents replaced arsenic trioxide in Hong Kong and around the world. In the 1970s, however, the specific activity of arsenic trioxide against acute promyelocytic leukaemia was re-discovered during the Cultural Revolution in Harbin, China. In 1997, Hong Kong was returned to China. In the same year, arsenic trioxide returned to the world stage. Intravenous arsenic trioxide became the worldwide standard therapy for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Oral administration of arsenic trioxide was revived in Hong Kong in 2000. This resulted in the first locally produced, registered, patented prescription drug in Hong Kong. Pending imminent manufacture, this product is poised to revolutionise acute promyelocytic leukaemia care and may hold the key to saving the lives of acute promyelocytic leukaemia patients worldwide. The remarkable journey of arsenic in the setting of medical history of China and Hong Kong is reviewed.","['Au, W Y']",['Au WY'],"['University Medicine Unit, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong. auwing@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,['N712M78A8G (Arsenic)'],IM,"['Arsenic/*history', 'China', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'History, Ancient', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/*history']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 2011 Dec;17(6):507-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To functionally identify critical molecular targets, we conducted a genome-scale lethality study in multiple myeloma cells using siRNAs. We validated the top 160 lethal hits with four siRNAs per gene in three multiple myeloma cell lines and two non-myeloma cell lines, cataloging a total of 57 potent multiple myeloma survival genes. We identified the Bcl2 family member MCL1 and several 26S proteasome subunits among the most important and selective multiple myeloma survival genes. These results provided biologic validation of our screening strategy. Other essential targets included genes involved in RNA splicing, ubiquitination, transcription, translation, and mitosis. Several of the multiple myeloma survival genes, especially MCL1, TNK2, CDK11, and WBSCR22, exhibited differential expression in primary plasma cells compared with other human primary somatic tissues. Overall, the most striking differential functional vulnerabilities between multiple myeloma and non-multiple myeloma cells were found to occur within the 20S proteasome subunits, MCL1, RRM1, USP8, and CKAP5. We propose that these genes should be investigated further as potential therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.","['Tiedemann, Rodger E', 'Zhu, Yuan Xao', 'Schmidt, Jessica', 'Shi, Chang Xin', 'Sereduk, Chris', 'Yin, Hongwei', 'Mousses, Spyro', 'Stewart, A Keith']","['Tiedemann RE', 'Zhu YX', 'Schmidt J', 'Shi CX', 'Sereduk C', 'Yin H', 'Mousses S', 'Stewart AK']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. rodger.tiedemann@uhnresearch.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (BUD23 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK11a protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Lethal/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', '*RNA Interference']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-2781 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2781 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Feb 1;72(3):757-68. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2781.

Patients with diagnosis of any kind of leukemia, at any stage of treatment, having a minimum age of 14 years, treated at the Department of Hematology-Oncology of the University Hospital of Santa Maria, Brazil, between December 2009 and March 2010, were assessed. Excluded patients were: edentulous, with orthodontic appliances, with psychomotor disturbances, requiring antibiotic prophylaxis for the examinations, or those using medications associated with gingival swelling. Two trained and calibrated examiners evaluated the Plaque Index, Gingival Index (GI), Probing depth, Bleeding on Probing (BOP), and Clinical Attachment Loss. Hematologic data were collected from a blood test performed on the same day as the periodontal examination. Thirty-seven patients (26 males), aged between 15 and 80 years (mean age 41.7 +/- 18.31) were evaluated. Correlation between platelet count and BOP (p > 0.05), or between platelet count and GI (p > 0.05), were both weak (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.171 and r = -0.003, respectively) and not statistically significant.

METHODS: Eighteen patients treated with dasatinib and H2RA, PPI or no acid suppressant from whom were obtained a total of 34 pharmacokinetic profiles were enrolled in the study. Dasatinib plasma concentrations from samples obtained just prior to and 1, 2, and 4 h after oral dasatinib administration were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between the dose-adjusted total area under the observed plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-4)) of dasatinib and gender, age, weight, or body surface area. The only variable factor, the dasatinib dose-adjusted AUC(0-4) for patients administered an H2RA or PPI, was significantly lower than for patients not administered an acid suppressant (median (quartile 1-quartile 3) values: 1.47 (0.79-2.29) versus 3.51 (2.50-5.45) ng h/mL/mg, respectively, P = 0.0008). Moreover, the plasma concentration 2 h (C(2h)) after dasatinib administration gave a high correlation with the AUC(0-4) of dasatinib (r = 0.9419, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware that administration of an acid suppressant such as famotidine, nizatidine, and lansoprazole can decrease the absorption of dasatinib from the gastrointestinal tract, thereby resulting in a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of dasatinib. The combination of dasatinib and an acid suppressant requires careful therapeutic drug monitoring of the dasatinib plasma concentration to ensure effective patient exposure to the drug.","['Takahashi, Naoto', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Niioka, Takenori', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Takahashi N', 'Miura M', 'Niioka T', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles)', '0 (Histamine H2 Antagonists)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0K5C5T2QPG (Lansoprazole)', '5QZO15J2Z8 (Famotidine)', 'P41PML4GHR (Nizatidine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Famotidine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lansoprazole', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nizatidine/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1797-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Apr;69(4):999-1004. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1797-3.

This 'double-sheet' structure provides soft or stiff microdomains that guide the self-patterning of different cell types [e.g. chronic myeloid leukemia (KU812), cervix carcinoma (HeLa), NIH 3T3 and BJ], thereby stimulating their cytoskeletal remodeling. More interestingly, we used these uniform PDMS surfaces with patterned rigidity for obtaining co-cultures of tumor blood cells (KU812) and adherent fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) with spatially-controlled distribution. Thus, beyond single-cell stiffening and mechanosensing, these surfaces should also be used as simple and feasible co-culture systems for mimicking and dissecting the bidirectional interactions between blood cells and specific stromal elements of their in vivo microenvironment.","['Palama, Ilaria E', ""D'Amone, Stefania"", 'Coluccia, Addolorata M L', 'Biasiucci, Mariano', 'Gigli, Giuseppe']","['Palama IE', ""D'Amone S"", 'Coluccia AM', 'Biasiucci M', 'Gigli G']","['NNL, Institute of Nanoscience CNR, Via Arnesano, 73100 Lecce, Italy. ilaria.palama@unisalento.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '0 (Laminin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/*chemistry', 'Extracellular Matrix/*chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2ib00116k [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Feb;4(2):228-36. doi: 10.1039/c2ib00116k.

Campath-1 H (alemtuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody to CD52 antigen, is thought to reduce GVHD incidence through in vivo T-cell depletion. Through the same mechanism it can potentially increase the risk of relapse by reducing the graft versus leukemia effect and possibly increase the risk of infection due to delayed immune recovery. A retrospective case analysis of 17 pediatric matched unrelated HSCTs done in our institution between January 2003 and June 2009 with Campath-1H as part of the pretransplant conditioning regimen was conducted. Grade I-II acute GVHD was noted in 29.4% of the HSCTs. No patient developed chronic GVHD. All but one patient with severe aplastic anemia engrafted. A relapse of primary disease was noted in 35.3% of the transplants. Three patient deaths were due to relapse and 1 due to disseminated varicella infection. Overall survival was 100% and 94% at 100 days and 1 year, respectively.

We retrospectively analyzed 207 patients consecutively diagnosed with ALL at Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland from 1995 to 2007 to determine if delay in chemotherapy increased the risk of relapse, death, transfer to the intensive care unit, or bacteremia. Friday admission did not significantly delay chemotherapy initiation with treatment started at a mean of 4.13+/-2.40 days for Friday admits versus 3.72+/-1.57 days for all others (P=0.29). There was no significant association between treatment delay days and relapse (P=0.94) or death (P=0.55). In Cox regression analysis, treatment delay was not a predictor of time to relapse (P=0.80) or longer duration of hospitalization (corrected for delay, P=0.15). There were trends toward significant associations between treatment delay and bacteremia (P=0.07) and intensive care unit admissions (P=0.08), although both were associated with shorter, not longer, treatment delays.We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of delay in chemotherapy initiation for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL on the examined outcome variables.","['Wahl, Shannon Kelly', 'Gildengorin, Ginny', 'Feusner, James']","['Wahl SK', 'Gildengorin G', 'Feusner J']","['Blood Systems Research Institute and Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822e9c0b [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jan;34(1):e8-e11. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822e9c0b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia is clinically and pathologically subdivided into a variety of large groups. The risk of developing leukemia may be influenced by polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. In this work, we conduct a case-control study to assess the impact of polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 genes on the risk of developing leukemia. Our data have shown that GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 were respectively associated with 2.05 and 4.36 increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have also shown that GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 act additively to increase the risk for ALL. Indeed, patients harbouring the ""GSTM1*0/GSTT1*0"" genotype were at 11.81-fold increased risk for developing ALL (P = 2 10(-5)). The risk for developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases on patients with ""rapid or intermediate NAT2 genotypes"". Finally, the comparison of leukemia subgroups according to GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 genotypes, suggests that leukemogenesis of different leukemia subgroups is very distinct.

RESULTS: The various renal manifestations can be divided into specific and paraneoplastic. They include paraneoplastic glomerulopathies (membranous glomerulonephristis being the most frequent), direct involvement of the renal parenchyma, hydroelectrolytic abnormalities (hypercalcemia, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion...), retroperitoneal fibrosis, micro-angiothrombotic disease and tumor lysis syndrome.

Between 1991 and 2001, 2 girls and 1 boy, aged 6, 6, and 4 years, respectively, were diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia and treated with wide resection and reconstruction with a condylar unipolar expandable tibial prosthesis. A press-fitted technique was used for component insertion. All patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiographic and functional follow-up took place at least once a year for a minimum of 4 years. Adequate pain control, limb-length equality, and acceptable function were obtained in all patients. One patient presented with significant range of motion reduction (0 degrees - 30 degrees ) in the affected knee. Limb lengthening was performed as needed to maintain balanced limb length. All patients had a good Musculoskeletal Tumor Society category score. No complications occurred in terms of component loosening or infection. One patient died shortly after 4-year follow-up because of doxorubicin-induced leukemia. Currently used hinged, expandable prostheses can jeopardize the unaffected distal femoral growth plate. This article describes a technique of reconstruction that spares the distal femoral growth plate. Adequate limb length can be expected with acceptable functional outcome.

In the present study, patients with CBF AML were therefore analyzed for the KIT D816V mutation and mutation positive cases subsequently analyzed for the presence of SM. The KIT D816V mutation was detected in eight of 20 cases of CBF AML, with the frequency in t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13.1;q22) positive cases being 31% and 57%, respectively. The fraction of KIT D816V mutation positive cells was highly variable among the eight mutation positive patients, with levels ranging from 0.04 to 98% in a pretreatment blood sample. Five of the eight cases carried the mutation in a cell fraction below one-tenth of the blast cell fraction, thus suggesting that KIT mutation is often a late event in leukemogenesis. None of the eight KIT D816V mutation positive cases fulfilled the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria of SM. The presence of the KIT D816V mutation in the CBF AML subgroup can therefore not be considered indicative of associated SM.","['Kristensen, Thomas', 'Preiss, Birgitte', 'Broesby-Olsen, Sigurd', 'Vestergaard, Hanne', 'Friis, Lone', 'Moller, Michael Boe']","['Kristensen T', 'Preiss B', 'Broesby-Olsen S', 'Vestergaard H', 'Friis L', 'Moller MB']","['Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark. thomas.kristensen@ouh.regionsyddanmark.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120131,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Child', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.647314 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1338-44. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.647314.

Recent findings in the field demonstrate that T-ALL is much more heterogeneous than originally believed and extremely diverse outcomes of patients require refinement of T-ALL classification, leading to subtype-specific adjustment of treatment. Many different biological features of T-ALL blast cells have recently been found to contribute to disease development and patient outcome and their analysis could potentially be introduced into improved diagnostics and classification of the disease. This review focuses on five key issues of T-ALL biology: chromosome aberrations, gene expression profiles, gene mutations, DNA methylation patterns, and immunoglobulin/T cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements. Additionally, molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease, by far the most reliable independent prognostic factor in T-ALL, has been highlighted in the context of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements. Translation of this biological information into better prognostic classification and more effective treatment should lead to improvement of outcome in T-ALL patients.","['Kraszewska, Monika D', 'Dawidowska, Malgorzata', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Witt, Michal']","['Kraszewska MD', 'Dawidowska M', 'Szczepanski T', 'Witt M']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland. m.kraszewska@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111207,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08957.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Feb;156(3):303-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08957.x.

METHODS: Expression profiles of differential proteins were identified, and new biomarkers or pathways related to BC in CML were screened through proteomic analysis. Total proteins from primary bone marrow cells of CML patients in chronic phase (CP) and BC were separated via two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then analyzed by imagemaster 5.0 software to detect differential protein spots which were already identified by mass spectrometry. Based on the variation of the whole expression profile, some key proteins were picked out for Western blot to confirm the accuracy of proteomics data. Moreover, related signal pathways involving those proteins were investigated. RESULTS: The result indicated that thirteen protein points between CML-CP and CML-BC were successfully determined. Results from Western blot of RhoA, hnRNPK, ANXA1, PSMB4, and LTA4H were similar to those from 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most of those proteins were involved in the proteosome pathway and the small G-protein pathway. CONCLUSION: A group of proteins associated with BC can be obtained and the result of this study might provide clues for further research.","['Zhang, J', 'Jin, Z', 'DU, Q', 'Li, R', 'Yao, F', 'Huang, B', 'Xu, N', 'Xu, L', 'Luo, X', 'Liu, X']","['Zhang J', 'Jin Z', 'DU Q', 'Li R', 'Yao F', 'Huang B', 'Xu N', 'Xu L', 'Luo X', 'Liu X']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (ANXA10 protein, human)', '0 (Annexins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '146410-60-8 (HNRNPK protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (PSMB4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Annexins/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2011/12/08 06:00,2012/11/10 06:00,['2011/12/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01389.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Jun;34(3):267-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01389.x.

METHODS: The cell lines were exposed to bortezomib, DNR, and bortezomib plus DNR, and cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis rate, and expression of MDR1/BCL2 were analyzed. RESULTS: Bortezomib potently inhibited growth and increased the apoptosis rate in the cell lines. In K562/MDR1 and K562/A02, the calcium channel blocker verapamil reduced the 50% inhibitory concentration and apoptosis rate of DNR, a P-gp protein substrate, but not of bortezomib. Bortezomib plus DNR had synergistic effect on antiproliferation (synergistic ratio > 1). Apoptosis was substantially more increased by the combination of two drugs than by bortezomib alone. Bortezomib arrested the cell cycles of three cell lines at the G2/M stage, decreased BCL2 mRNA expression, but did not affect MDR1 mRNA levels. The antiproliferative role of bortezomib was also confirmed in primary leukemia cells.

Mutations in RUNX1 are thought to confer upon hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) a pre-leukemic state, but the fundamental properties of Runx1 deficient pre-leukemic HSCs are not well defined. Here we show that Runx1 deficiency decreases both apoptosis and proliferation, but only minimally impacts the frequency of long term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs). It has been variously reported that Runx1 loss increases LT-HSC numbers, decreases LT-HSC numbers, or causes age-related HSC exhaustion. We attempt to resolve these discrepancies by showing that Runx1 deficiency alters the expression of several key HSC markers, and that the number of functional LT-HSCs varies depending on the criteria used to score them. Finally, we identify genes and pathways, including the cell cycle and p53 pathways that are dysregulated in Runx1 deficient HSCs.","['Cai, Xiongwei', 'Gaudet, Justin J', 'Mangan, James K', 'Chen, Michael J', 'De Obaldia, Maria Elena', 'Oo, Zaw', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Speck, Nancy A']","['Cai X', 'Gaudet JJ', 'Mangan JK', 'Chen MJ', 'De Obaldia ME', 'Oo Z', 'Ernst P', 'Speck NA']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'Fetus/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028430 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13285 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e28430. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028430.

Understanding how viral vectors integrate into the human genome is a key issue in predicting these risks. We provide a new statistical method to compare retroviral integration patterns. We identified the positions where vectors derived from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) show different integration behaviors in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Non-parametric density estimation was used to identify candidate comparative hotspots, which were then tested and ranked. We found 100 significative comparative hotspots, distributed throughout the chromosomes. HIV hotspots were wider and contained more genes than MLV ones. A Gene Ontology analysis of HIV targets showed enrichment of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, reflecting the high HIV integration frequency observed at the MHC locus on chromosome 6. Four histone modifications/variants had a different mean density in comparative hotspots (H2AZ, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me1), while gene expression within the comparative hotspots did not differ from background. These findings suggest the existence of epigenetic or nuclear three-dimensional topology contexts guiding retroviral integration to specific chromosome areas.","['Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'Glad, Ingrid K', 'Pellin, Danilo', 'Cattoglio, Claudia', 'Mavilio, Fulvio', 'Di Serio, Clelia', 'Frigessi, Arnoldo']","['Ambrosi A', 'Glad IK', 'Pellin D', 'Cattoglio C', 'Mavilio F', 'Di Serio C', 'Frigessi A']","['University Center of Statistics for the Biomedical Sciences, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', '*Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Virus Integration']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002292 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-11-00869 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2011 Dec;7(12):e1002292. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002292.

Here, we studied the role of the TNF family member 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) during the interaction of NK cells with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. 4-1BBL was highly expressed on patient B-CLL cells in all 56 investigated cases. Signaling via 4-1BBL following interaction with 4-1BB, which was detected on NK cells of CLL patients but not healthy individuals, led to the release of immunoregulatory cytokines including TNF by CLL cells. CLL patient sera contained elevated levels of TNF and induced 4-1BB upregulation on NK cells, which in turn impaired direct and Rituximab-induced NK-cell reactivity against 4-1BBL-expressing targets. NK-cell reactivity was not only enhanced by blocking the interaction of NK cell-expressed 4-1BB with 4-1BBL expressed by CLL cells, but also by preventing 4-1BB upregulation on NK cells via neutralization of TNF in patient serum with Infliximab. Our data indicate that 4-1BBL mediates NK-cell immunosubversion in CLL, and thus might contribute to the reportedly compromised efficacy of Rituximab to induce NK-cell reactivity in the disease, and that TNF neutralization may serve to enhance the efficacy of Rituximab treatment in CLL.","['Buechele, Corina', 'Baessler, Tina', 'Schmiedel, Benjamin J', 'Schumacher, Carla E', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Rittig, Kilian', 'Salih, Helmut R']","['Buechele C', 'Baessler T', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Schumacher CE', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Rittig K', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology, Eberhard Karls University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111220,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/genetics/*immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA/chemistry/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/07/19 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201141920 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2012 Mar;42(3):737-48. doi: 10.1002/eji.201141920.

Despite the chemical simplicity of the Tn antigen, its antigenic structure is considered to be complex and the clear determinants of Tn antigenicity remain poorly understood. As a consequence, a broad variety of anti-Tn monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been generated. To further investigate the nature and complexity of the Tn antigen, we generated seven different anti-Tn mAbs of IgM and IgG classes raised against human Jurkat T cells, which are Tn-positive due to the low activity of T-synthase and mutation in specific chaperone Cosmc. The binding analysis of anti-Tn mAbs with the array of synthetic saccharides, glycopeptides and O-glycoproteins revealed unexpected differences in specificities of anti-Tn mAbs. IgM mAbs bound the terminal GalNAc residue of the Tn antigen irrespective of the peptide context or with low selectivity to the glycoproteins. In contrast, IgG mAbs recognized the Tn antigen in the context of a specific peptide motif. Particularly, JA3 mAb reacted to the GSPP or GSPAPP, and JA5 mAb recognized specifically the GSP motif (glycosylation sites are underlined). The major O-glycan carrier proteins CD43 and CD162 and isoforms of CD45 expressed on Jurkat cells were precipitated by anti-Tn mAbs with different affinities. In summary, our data suggest that Tn antigen-Ab binding capacity is determined by the peptide context of the Tn antigen, antigenic specificity of the Ab and class of the immunoglobulin. The newly generated anti-Tn IgG mAbs with the strong specificity to glycoprotein CD43 can be particularly interesting for the application in leukemia diagnostics and therapy.","['Blixt, Ola', 'Lavrova, Olga I', 'Mazurov, Dmitriy V', 'Clo, Emiliano', 'Kracun, Stjepan K', 'Bovin, Nicolai V', 'Filatov, Alexander V']","['Blixt O', 'Lavrova OI', 'Mazurov DV', 'Clo E', 'Kracun SK', 'Bovin NV', 'Filatov AV']","['Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, dept. 24.6.48, DK-2200 N Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (C1GALT1C1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tn antigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/biosynthesis/*chemistry', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucin-1/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['cwr178 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwr178 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2012 Apr;22(4):529-42. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwr178.

The clinical impact of this phenomenon remains in discussion. METHODS: We analyzed 5,523 patients with CLL (21-97 years) by multiparametric flow cytometry and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region mutational status analysis, and clinical outcome studies. RESULTS: CD8 was positive in 61/5,523 (1.1%) patients. ZAP-70 expression amounted to a mean of 25.4% in CD8-positive vs. 28.2% in CD8-negative cases (n.s.), CD38 expression to a mean of 38.6% vs. 34.0% (n.s.). Cytogenetic alterations did not differ significantly [CD8-positive vs. CD8-negative: 13q deletion: 24/36 (66.7%) vs. 2,015/3,368 (59.8%); trisomy 12:7/35 (20.0%) vs. 487/3,357 (14.5%); 11q deletion: 6/35 (17.1%) vs. 360/3,354 (10.7%)]. A mutated IGHV status showed similar frequency in CD8-positive and CD8-negative cases (31/44; 70.5% vs. 1,700/2,816; 60.4%; n.s.). CD8-positive patients had a shorter median time to treatment compared with CD8-negative patients (12.0 vs. 77.1 months, P = 0.008). In univariable Cox analysis, CD8-positivity adversely influenced median TTT (P = 0.011). In multivariable analysis, the strongest parameters were hemoglobin level and mutated IGHV status (P < 0.001 for both) but CD8-positivity was still relevant (P = 0.074). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that CD8 expression is a recurrent albeit rare phenomenon in patients with CLL and suggests that CD8 expression has an adverse prognostic impact. Therefore, CD8 expression should be further investigated for its potential to contribute to risk stratification in patients with CLL.","['Kern, Wolfgang', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kern W', 'Bacher U', 'Haferlach C', 'Alpermann T', 'Dicker F', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. wolfgang.kern@mll.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111205,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Below this region, osteoblasts formed large quantities of woven bone. In contrast, in adult bone undergoing remodeling osteoclast formation was unaffected by LIF deficiency, whereas osteoblast formation and function were both significantly impaired, resulting in osteopenia. Consistent with LIF promoting osteoblast commitment, enhanced marrow adipocyte formation was also observed in adult LIF null mice, and adipocytic differentiation of murine stromal cells was delayed by LIF treatment. LIF, therefore, controls vascular size and osteoclast differentiation during the transition of cartilage to bone, whereas an anatomically separate LIF-dependent pathway regulates osteoblast and adipocyte commitment in bone remodeling.","['Poulton, Ingrid J', 'McGregor, Narelle E', 'Pompolo, Sueli', 'Walker, Emma C', 'Sims, Natalie A']","['Poulton IJ', 'McGregor NE', 'Pompolo S', 'Walker EC', 'Sims NA']","[""St Vincent's Institute, 9 Princes St, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blood Vessels/growth & development', 'Bone Development/*physiology', 'Bone Remodeling/*physiology', 'Bone and Bones/*blood supply', 'Female', 'Growth Plate/blood supply/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/07/19 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jbmr.1485 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2012 Mar;27(3):586-95. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.1485.,,,,,['(c) 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the accepted model of SSC self-renewal, Asingle (As) spermatogonia are the stem cells, whereas paired (Apaired (Apr)) and chained (Aaligned (Aal)) undifferentiated spermatogonia are committed to differentiation. This model has been recently challenged by evidence that As and chained (Apr and Aal), undifferentiated spermatogonia are heterogeneous in terms of gene expression and function. The expression profile of several markers, such as GFRA1 (the GDNF co-receptor), is heterogeneous among As, Apr and Aal spermatogonia. In this study, we have analysed and quantified the distribution of GFRA1-expressing cells within the different stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. We show that in all stages, GFRA1+ chained spermatogonia (Apr to Aal) are more numerous than GFRA1+ As spermatogonia. Numbers of chained GFRA1+ spermatogonia are sharply reduced in stages VII-VIII when Aal differentiate into A1 spermatogonia. GFRA1 expression is regulated by GDNF and in cultures of isolated seminiferous tubules, we found that GDNF expression and secretion by Sertoli cells is stage-dependent, being maximal in stages II-VI and decreasing thereafter. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we found that GDNF regulates the expression of genes such as Tex14, Sohlh1 and Kit (c-Kit) known to be involved in spermatogonial differentiation. Expression of Kit was upregulated by GDNF in a stage-specific manner. Our data indicate that GDNF, besides its crucial role in the self-renewal of stem cells also functions in the differentiation of chained undifferentiated spermatogonia.","['Grasso, Margherita', 'Fuso, Andrea', 'Dovere, Lisa', 'de Rooij, Dirk G', 'Stefanini, Mario', 'Boitani, Carla', 'Vicini, Elena']","['Grasso M', 'Fuso A', 'Dovere L', 'de Rooij DG', 'Stefanini M', 'Boitani C', 'Vicini E']","['Fondazione Pasteur Cenci Bolognetti, Section of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopaedic Sciences, La Sapienza University of Rome, Via Antonio Scarpa 14, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Seminiferous Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-11-0385 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-11-0385 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2012 Mar;143(3):325-32. doi: 10.1530/REP-11-0385.

We found that HOXC10 is overexpressed in breast cancer and transcriptionally regulated by estrogen (17beta-estradiol, E(2)). The HOXC10 promoter contains several estrogen response elements (ERE1-7, half-sites). A luciferase-based reporter assay showed that ERE1 and ERE6 of HOXC10 promoter are E(2) responsive. ERalpha and ERbeta play critical roles in E(2)-mediated activation of HOXC10. Knockdown of ERalpha and ERbeta downregulated E(2)-induced HOXC10 expression. ERalpha and ERbeta bind to ERE1 and ERE6 regions in an E(2)-dependent manner. Additionally, knockdown of histone methylases MLL3 and MLL4 (but not MLL1 and MLL2) diminished E(2)-induced expression of HOXC10. MLL3 and MLL4 were bound to the ERE1 and ERE6 regions of HOXC10 promoter in an E(2)-dependent manner. Overall, we demonstrated that HOXC10 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and it is an E(2)-responsive gene. Histone methylases MLL3 and MLL4, along with ERs, regulate HOXC10 gene expression in the presence of E(2).","['Ansari, Khairul I', 'Hussain, Imran', 'Kasiri, Sahba', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Ansari KI', 'Hussain I', 'Kasiri S', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120125,England,J Mol Endocrinol,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (HOXC10 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choriocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Estrogens/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Pregnancy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JME-11-0078 [pii]', '10.1530/JME-11-0078 [doi]']",epublish,J Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Jan 25;48(1):61-75. doi: 10.1530/JME-11-0078.

Both of the child's parents provided information about their smoking habits for each year from age 15 years to the child's birth. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Maternal smoking was not associated with risk of childhood ALL, but the odds ratio for paternal smoking of >/=15 cigarettes per day around the time of the child's conception was 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.86). The associations between parental smoking risk of childhood ALL did not differ substantially by immunophenotypic or cytogenetic subtype. Meta-analyses of paternal smoking, including results from the Australian Study of Causes of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children and those of previous studies, produced summary odds ratios of 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.24) for any paternal smoking around the time of the child's conception and 1.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.68) for smoking >/=20 cigarettes per day at that time.

Various miRNAs and their functions have been intensively studied in acute leukemias but the mechanisms that control their expression are largely unknown for the majority of aberrantly expressed miRNAs. miRNA expression can be regulated by the same genetic mechanism that modulate protein coding genes such as mutation, deletion, amplification, loss of heterozygosity and translocations. In this review we focus on the regulation of miRNAs in acute leukemias mediated by alterations in epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone code, describing the role of these alterations in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of acute leukemias and their possible use as new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.","['Agirre, X', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Odero, M D', 'Prosper, F']","['Agirre X', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Odero MD', 'Prosper F']","['Oncology Area, Foundation for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111206,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011344 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.344 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Mar;26(3):395-403. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.344.

We show here that the specific mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 blocked mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in AML. Particularly, AZD8055 fully inhibited multisite eIF4E-binding protein 1 phosphorylation, subsequently blocking protein translation, which was in contrast to the effects of rapamycin. In addition, the mTORC1-dependent PI3K/Akt feedback activation was fully abrogated in AZD8055-treated AML cells. Significantly, AZD8055 decreased AML blast cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, reduced the clonogenic growth of leukemic progenitors and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells but not in normal immature CD34+ cells. Interestingly, AZD8055 strongly induced autophagy, which may be either protective or cell death inducing, depending on concentration. Finally, AZD8055 markedly increased the survival of AML transplanted mice through a significant reduction of tumor growth, without apparent toxicity. Our current results strongly suggest that AZD8055 should be tested in AML patients in clinical trials.","['Willems, L', 'Chapuis, N', 'Puissant, A', 'Maciel, T T', 'Green, A S', 'Jacque, N', 'Vignon, C', 'Park, S', 'Guichard, S', 'Herault, O', 'Fricot, A', 'Hermine, O', 'Moura, I C', 'Auberger, P', 'Ifrah, N', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Bonnet, D', 'Lacombe, C', 'Mayeux, P', 'Bouscary, D', 'Tamburini, J']","['Willems L', 'Chapuis N', 'Puissant A', 'Maciel TT', 'Green AS', 'Jacque N', 'Vignon C', 'Park S', 'Guichard S', 'Herault O', 'Fricot A', 'Hermine O', 'Moura IC', 'Auberger P', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Bonnet D', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D', 'Tamburini J']","['Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRTC2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '970JJ37FPW', '((5-(2,4-bis((3S)-3-methylmorpholin-4-yl)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7-yl)-2-methoxyph', 'enyl)methanol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011339 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.339 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1195-202. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.339.

Histiocytic diseases can be devided into neoplastic (cutaneous histiocytoma complex, histiocytic sarcoma, dendritic cell leukaemia) and reactive forms (reactive histiocytosis, haemophagocytic syndrome). All subtypes of the cutaneous histiocytoma complex (cutaneous histiocytoma, metastatic histiocytoma and Langerhans' cell histiocytosis) are of Langerhans' cell origin. Histiocytoma, which is a solitary tumour of the skin in young dogs, shows spontaneous regression in most cases. Occasionally, metastasis to lymph nodes can be seen (metastatic histiocytoma). Only one dog with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis has been described and was euthanized. Histiocytic sarcoma, which arises from myeloid dendritic cells, can be classified as localised histiocytic sarcoma or disseminated histiocytic sarcoma. Another form of histiocytic sarcoma - haemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma - is derived from macrophages. Histiocytic sarcoma displays a very aggressive clinical course and has a poor prognosis. Breed predispositions have been reported for the disseminated and haemophagocytic form of histiocytic sarcoma in Bernese mountain dogs, Rottweilers and varoiusretrievers. In contrast, reactive histiocytosis (cutaneous and systemic forms) develops by reactive proliferation of interstitial dendritic cells. In systemic histiocytosis, breed predilections are similar to histiocytic sarcoma. Haemophagocytic syndrome develops as a consequence of proliferation of activated macrophages in different tissues. Prognosis in general is moderate to poor and depends on the origin of the underlying disease process.","['Schwens, Ch', 'Thom, N', 'Moritz, A']","['Schwens Ch', 'Thom N', 'Moritz A']","['Klinikum Veterinarmedizin, Klinik fur Kleintiere der Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Frankfurter Strasse 126, 35392 Giessen. christinacoenen@yahoo.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Tierarztliche Praxis.

METHODS: We examined the expression of p53, p21, Bax, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) proteins immunohistochemically in 105 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer invading the serosa. Postoperative oral UFT was prescribed for 1 year. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared with the two-sided log-rank test. RESULTS: Positive staining for p53, p21, Bax, and Mcl-1 proteins was found in 63.8, 52.4, 39.0, and 72.4% of the subjects, respectively. Survival time did not differ significantly between the patients with and those without p53, p21, and Bax expression. However, patients with Mcl-1- tumors survived longer than those with Mcl-1+ tumors. Postoperative UFT treatment did not improve survival; however, adjuvant UFT significantly prolonged the survival of patients with p53-, p21-), Bax+, or Mcl-1+ tumors, but not of patients with p53+, p21+, Bax-, or Mcl-1- tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer may be affected by the status of apoptosis-related proteins such as p53, p21, Bax, and Mcl-1. However, because susceptibility to apoptosis did not explain the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents, further investigation of the mutual interaction between apoptosis-related proteins is required.","['Tsujitani, Shunichi', 'Saito, Hiroaki', 'Wakatsuki, Toshiro', 'Ikeguchi, Masahide', 'Shirabe, Ken', 'Morita, Masaru', 'Kakeji, Yoshihiro', 'Yano, Tokujiro', 'Maehara, Yoshihiko']","['Tsujitani S', 'Saito H', 'Wakatsuki T', 'Ikeguchi M', 'Shirabe K', 'Morita M', 'Kakeji Y', 'Yano T', 'Maehara Y']","['Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. stsujitani@me.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20111206,Japan,Surg Today,Surgery today,9204360,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', '1-UFT protocol']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gastrectomy', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/surgery', 'Tegafur/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Uracil/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00595-011-0062-z [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Today. 2012 Feb;42(3):225-32. doi: 10.1007/s00595-011-0062-z.

The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 37.6% in the related PBSCT group and 53.7% in the unrelated PBSCT group. The cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was also higher in the unrelated PBSCT group (19.5%) than in the related PBSCT group (8.9%). The overall survival rate at 4 years was 62.4 +/- 5.4 and 53.8 +/- 1.2% (p = 0.535) in the related and unrelated PBSCT group, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, unrelated PBSCT was identified as a risk factor for the development of extensive chronic GVHD (hazard ratio = 3.019, p = 0.027). Unfavorable cytogenetics and the disease status at the time of transplantation were found to be related to overall survival. In the case of high-risk AML, the survival rate and relapse incidence were significantly better in the matched unrelated PBSCT group (p = 0.047 and 0.039, respectively). In conclusion, the allogeneic PBSCT outcomes for AML were comparable in the matched related and matched unrelated groups. Nonetheless, for high-risk AML patients, matched unrelated PBSCT was found to be preferable to matched related PBSCT.","['Lee, Soo Jung', 'Kang, Byung Woog', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Chae, Yee Soo', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Jung, Joo Seop', 'Cho, Goon-Jae', 'Jo, Deog-Yeon', 'Kim, Yeo Kyeoung', 'Kim, Hyeoung Joon', 'Ryoo, Hun-Mo', 'Eom, Hyeon Seok', 'Lee, Sang Min', 'Joo, Young-Don', 'Won, Jong-Ho', 'Park, Moo Rim', 'Kim, Min Kyung', 'Hyun, Myung Soo', 'Sohn, Sang-Kyun']","['Lee SJ', 'Kang BW', 'Moon JH', 'Chae YS', 'Kim JG', 'Jung JS', 'Cho GJ', 'Jo DY', 'Kim YK', 'Kim HJ', 'Ryoo HM', 'Eom HS', 'Lee SM', 'Joo YD', 'Won JH', 'Park MR', 'Kim MK', 'Hyun MS', 'Sohn SK']","['Department of Hematology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111206,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Unrelated Donors']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000333133 [pii]', '10.1159/000333133 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(2):81-9. doi: 10.1159/000333133.

A better understanding of the role of adoptive immunotherapy and its consequent bona fide graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect has resulted in a reduction of the ablative intensity and toxicity of preparative allo-HCT regimens. METHODS: The authors review the published data of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT in patients with CLL. RESULTS: RIC allo-HCT has reduced the transplant associated morbidity and mortality of the procedure and has consequently broadened applicability of allo-HCT to patients with CLL who are generally of more advanced age (> 60 years) and who often have associated comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Published literature supports the use of RIC allo-HCT for these patients once a suitable donor is identified, provided they fulfill acceptable consensus criteria for hematopoietic stem cell allografting. Several studies have shown that T-cell-replete RIC allo-HCT is also capable of overcoming the adverse effect of poor prognostic factors in CLL such as del(17p), unmutated IgVH, or ZAP-70 expression. Continued clinical trials to identify the optimal regimen for RIC allo-HCT for patients with CLL are warranted.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.

The vast majority of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL carry poor prognostic features, which are strong predictors of shorter overall survival and resistance to first-line treatment, particularly fludarabine-based regimens. METHODS: This article highlights the current role of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and active immunotherapy as treatment options for this select group. The rationale of using IMiDs is discussed from the perspective of lenalidomide as a novel active agent. Relevant clinical trials using IMiDs alone or in combinations are discussed. New immunotherapeutic experimental approaches are also described. RESULTS: As a single agent, lenalidomide offers an overall response rate of 32% to 47% in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. Recent studies have shown promising activity as a single agent in treatment-naive patients. The combination of lenalidomide with immunotherapy (rituximab and ofatumumab) has also shown clinical responses. Encouraging preclinical and early clinical data have been observed with different immunotherapeutic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IMiDs alone or in combination with immunotherapy represents a treatment option for relapsed/refractory or treatment-naive patients. Mature data and further studies are needed to validate overall and progression-free survival. The toxicity profile of lenalidomide might limit its use and delay further studies. Immunotherapy offers another potential alternative, but further understanding of the immunogenicity of CLL cells and the mechanisms of tumor fl are reaction is needed to improve the outcomes in this field.","['Carballido, Estrella', 'Veliz, Marays', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Carballido E', 'Veliz M', 'Komrokji R', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Active/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481201900106 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2012 Jan;19(1):54-67. doi: 10.1177/107327481201900106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This article reviews treatments options for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. RESULTS: Several studies have investigated novel agents in treating patients with 17p deletion, TP53 mutation, and fludarabine-refractory CLL, as well as patients with suboptimal response to intense treatment. These investigational agents include rituximab, alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, bendamustine, high-dose methylprednisolone, lenalidomide, lumiliximab, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, small modular immunopharmaceuticals, Bcl-2 inhibitors, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. While these newer drugs and combination therapies have shown promise as treatment options for CLL, additional studies are needed to determine the immunosuppression, toxicities, and infections associated with their use. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in initial overall response rates, most patients relapse and require further treatment. CLL remains incurable with standard therapies due to development of disease refractoriness. As such, novel approaches such as those noted above warrant continued research to improve outcomes for patients with CLL.","['Veliz, Marays', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Veliz M', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481201900105 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2012 Jan;19(1):37-53. doi: 10.1177/107327481201900105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examine the diagnosis of CLL, the role of prognostic factors in determining treatment goals, and current data on front-line management of CLL. RESULTS: The benefits of single-agent and combination therapies are associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. While more aggressive management may therefore be warranted, each patient's comorbidities and performance status must be weighed against the benefits, availability, cost, treatment goals, and incidence of adverse effects associated with each therapy. CONCLUSIONS: New single agents and novel treatment combinations have shown promising results in phase I/II studies. The ultimate therapeutic goals of prolonged survival and improved quality of life will be validated only by ongoing clinical and laboratory research and by continuous enrollment of patients in clinical trials.","['Desai, Sheetal', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Desai S', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Pharmacy, H.

It is defined by the presence of small clones of aberrant B cells in the peripheral blood, with a total B-cell count below the threshold for diagnosis of CLL (<5.0x10(9) cells/L). METHODS: The authors review current literature on the prevalence of MBL, and the clinical course of this CLL precursor condition, and recommended management for individuals with MBL. RESULTS: MBL occurs in approximately 4% to 5% of healthy adults. While most cases of CLL are preceded by MBL, progression to leukemia requiring CLL treatment occurs in only 1% to 2% of individuals with MBL per year. The absolute B-cell count is most strongly associated with progression, and patients with low-count MBL identified in population screening studies rarely develop CLL. Studies are ongoing to better define the relationship between MBL and CLL and to identify prognostic indicators that predict which patients will progress to CLL. Given their elevated risk of developing malignancy, individuals with clinical MBL should be monitored at least annually for progressive lymphocytosis and signs or symptoms of CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the epidemiologic and genetic factors associated with MBL development and its progression to CLL have not yet been identified. However, ongoing studies by many research groups are aimed at answering these questions to facilitate management of individuals with this premalignant condition. In addition, active investigation of MBL will likely yield new insights into the biology of CLL, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets for this incurable disease.","['Mowery, Yvonne M', 'Lanasa, Mark C']","['Mowery YM', 'Lanasa MC']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481201900102 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2012 Jan;19(1):8-17. doi: 10.1177/107327481201900102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on the expression of three osteotropic cytokines in the IL-6 family expressed in human gingival fibroblasts were studied. IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 mRNA were constitutively expressed in human gingival fibroblasts. The inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha increased expression of IL-6, LIF, and IL-11 mRNA and protein in the gingival fibroblasts. Addition of IL-4 or IL-13 had no effect on IL-6 expression, but significantly inhibited LIF and IL-11 mRNA and protein stimulated by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. No involvement of NF-kappaB or STAT1 was observed in the inhibition. STAT6 was phosphorylated at Y641 by treatment with IL-4 and knockdown of STAT6 with siRNA decreased the inhibition of IL-11 and LIF expression by IL-4 in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha stimulated cells. This study suggests that activation of STAT6 by IL-4 and IL-13, through type 2 IL-4 receptors, inhibits production of IL-11 and LIF stimulated by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in human gingival fibroblasts. A negative modulatory role of IL-4 and IL-13 in osteotropic cytokine production could be a mechanism playing an important inhibitory role in inflammation induced periodontitis.","['Souza, Pedro P C', 'Palmqvist, Py', 'Lundberg, Pernilla', 'Lundgren, Inger', 'Hanstrom, Lennart', 'Souza, Joao A C', 'Conaway, H Herschel', 'Lerner, Ulf H']","['Souza PP', 'Palmqvist P', 'Lundberg P', 'Lundgren I', 'Hanstrom L', 'Souza JA', 'Conaway HH', 'Lerner UH']","['Department of Molecular Periodontology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111203,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (IL11 protein, human)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-13)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gingiva/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-13/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Interleukins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-13/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(11)00788-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2011.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2012 Jan;49(4):601-10. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2011.10.009.

We prospectively collected germline DNA and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using overall survival (OS) as the endpoint. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 351 patients was genotyped for more than 550,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Associations between OS and SNPs were investigated using the log-linear 2-way multiplicative Cox proportional hazards model. The subset of 294 genetically European patients was used for the primary analysis. RESULTS: A nonsynonymous SNP in interleukin (IL)17F (rs763780, H161R) and an intronic SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium (rs7771466) were associated with OS using genome-wide criteria (P </= 10(-7)). Median OS was significantly shorter (P = 2.61 x 10(-8)) for the rs763780 heterozygotes [3.1 months; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-4.3] than for the patients without this variant (6.8 months; 95% CI, 5.8-7.3). After adjustment by stratification factors, the P value for the association was 9.51 x 10(-7). CONCLUSIONS: The variant 161R form of IL-17F is a natural antagonist of the antiangiogenic effects of wild-type 161H IL-17F, and angiogenesis may play an important role in the metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer. In this preliminary study, we hypothesize that the angiogenetic potential of pancreatic cancers in patients with variant IL-17F is higher than that of tumors in patients with wild-type IL-17F, conferring worse prognosis. This exploratory GWAS may provide the foundation for testing the biology and clinical effects of novel genes and their heritable variants through mechanistic and confirmatory studies in pancreatic cancer.","['Innocenti, Federico', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Cox, Nancy L', 'Evans, Patrick', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Zembutsu, Hitoshi', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Hollis, Donna', 'Mushiroda, Taisei', 'Li, Liang', 'Friedman, Paula', 'Wang, Liewei', 'Glubb, Dylan', 'Hurwitz, Herbert', 'Giacomini, Kathleen M', 'McLeod, Howard L', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Kindler, Hedy L', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Ratain, Mark J']","['Innocenti F', 'Owzar K', 'Cox NL', 'Evans P', 'Kubo M', 'Zembutsu H', 'Jiang C', 'Hollis D', 'Mushiroda T', 'Li L', 'Friedman P', 'Wang L', 'Glubb D', 'Hurwitz H', 'Giacomini KM', 'McLeod HL', 'Goldberg RM', 'Schilsky RL', 'Kindler HL', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ratain MJ']","['Department of Medicine, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (IL17F protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1387 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1387 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;18(2):577-84. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1387.

Hence, we propose a dual-layer 3D-QSAR model for FLT-3 that integrates the pharmacophore, CoMFA, and CoMSIA. We then coupled the model with the fragment-based design strategy to identify novel FLT-3 inhibitors. In the first layer, the previously established model, Hypo02, was evaluated in terms of its correlation coefficient (r), RMS, cost difference, and configuration cost, with values of 0.930, 1.24, 106.45, and 16.44, respectively. Moreover, Fischer's cross-validation test of data generated by Hypo02 yielded a 98% confidence level, and the validation of the testing set yielded a best r value of 0.87. The features of Hypo02 were separated into two parts and then used to screen the MiniMaybridge fragment compound database. Nine novel FLT-3 inhibitors were generated in this layer. In the second layer, Hypo02 was subjected to an alignment rule to generate CoMFA- and CoMSIA-based models, for which the partial least-squares validation method was utilized. The values of q(2), r(2), and predictive r(2) were 0.58, 0.98, and 0.76, respectively, derived from the CoMFA model with steric and electrostatic fields. The CoMSIA model with five different fields yielded values of 0.54, 0.97, and 0.76 for q(2), r(2), and predictive r(2), respectively. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models were used to constrain 3D structures of the nine novel FLT-3 inhibitors.

A clinical feature of vascular inflammation is increased circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) type cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but their role in vascular inflammation is not fully defined. IL-6 type cytokines activate transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which has a key role in inflammation and the innate immune response. Canonical STAT3 gene induction is due to phosphorylation of (1) Y705, leading to STAT3 dimerization and DNA binding and (2) S727, enhancing homodimerization and DNA binding by recruiting p300/CBP. We asked whether enhancing S727 STAT3 phosphorylation using the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor, calyculin A, would enhance LIF-induced gene expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Cotreatment with calyculin A and LIF markedly increased STAT3 S727 phosphorylation, without affecting the increase in the nuclear fraction of STAT3 phosphorylated on Y705. PP2A inhibitors, okadaic acid and fostriecin, did not enhance STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, calyculin A eliminated LIF-induced gene expression: (1) calyculin A reduced binding of nuclear extracts to a STAT3 consensus site, thereby reducing the overall level of binding observed with LIF; and (2) calyculin A caused p300/CBP phosphorylation, thus resulting in reduced acetylation activity and degradation. Together, these findings reveal a pivotal role of a protein serine/threonine phosphatases that is likely PP1 in HMEC in controlling STAT3 transcriptional activity.","['Zgheib, Carlos', 'Zouein, Fouad A', 'Chidiac, Rony', 'Kurdi, Mazen', 'Booz, George W']","['Zgheib C', 'Zouein FA', 'Chidiac R', 'Kurdi M', 'Booz GW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for Excellence in Cardiovascular-Renal Research, School of Medicine, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Marine Toxins', 'Microvessels/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2011.0059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2012 Feb;32(2):87-94. doi: 10.1089/jir.2011.0059.

The association between the prevalence of viral infections and hemorrhagic cystitis was evaluated in pretransplant and posttransplant recipients and donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid-treated blood and urine samples of 30 recipients and 24 donors were collected before hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and monitored for 100 days after transplant. Prevalence of BK virus DNA was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of adenovirus and cytomegalovirus DNA was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Type of transplant, conditioning regimens, graft-versus-host disease clinical grading, demographic data, hematologic, and biochemical indexes also were analyzed. RESULTS: Different grades of hematuria were found in 16 of 30 of the recipients with hemorrhagic cystitis. Severe hematuria and diffuse thickening of the bladder were found in 5 of 30 transplant patients. Multiple infections of BK virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus were seen in 5 patients with severe hemorrhagic cystitis. The viruria of these viruses was decreased in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis as follows: BK virus (5 of 5), adenovirus (2 of 5), and cytomegalovirus (not detected). Also, a significant relation was found between hemorrhagic cystitis and risk factors including donor-recipient sex mismatches, familial relationships, leukemia as an underlying disease, older age, allogenic type of transplant, prophylactic and therapeutic dose of anti-graft-versus-host-disease regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of single and multiple infections of BK virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus in blood and/or urine samples of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, in combination with 1 or more inducing factors of hemorrhagic cystitis were enforced on the important role these risk factors play in the cause of hemorrhagic cystitis.","['Shakiba, Elaheh', 'Yaghobi, Ramin', 'Ramzi, Mani']","['Shakiba E', 'Yaghobi R', 'Ramzi M']","['Hematology Research Center, Namazee Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Adenoviridae Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'BK Virus/genetics', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystitis/*epidemiology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood/urine', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematuria/epidemiology', 'Hemorrhage/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyomavirus Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/07 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2011 Dec;9(6):405-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified AXL overexpression in Imatinib (IM)-resistant CML cell lines and patients. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of AXL and the mechanisms underlying AXL overexpression in Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cells. We present evidence that high AXL expression level is a feature of TKI-resistant CML cells and knockdown of AXL sensitized TKI-resistant cells to IM. In addition, expression of wild-type AXL but not a dominant negative form of AXL confers IM-sensitive CML cells the capacity to resist IM effect. AXL overexpression required PKCalpha and beta and constitutive activation of ERK1/2. Accordingly, GF109203X a PKC inhibitor, U0126 a MEK1 inhibitor and PKCalpha/beta knockdown restore sensitivity to IM while PKCalpha or PKCbeta overexpression in CML cells promotes protection against IM-induced cell death. Finally, using luciferase promoter activity assays we established that AXL is regulated transcriptionally through the AP1 transcription factor. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of AXL in resistance to TKI in CML cells, identify the molecular mechanisms involved in its overexpression and support the notion that AXL is a new marker of resistance to TKI in CML.","['Dufies, Maeva', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Belhacene, Nathalie', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Cassuto, Jill Patrice', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Dufies M', 'Jacquel A', 'Belhacene N', 'Robert G', 'Cluzeau T', 'Luciano F', 'Cassuto JP', 'Raynaud S', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U895, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Team Cell Death, Differentiation, Inflammation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['360 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.360 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Nov;2(11):874-85. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.360.,,PMC3259992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of this PPAR-gamma agonist on the expression of tissue factor (TF), a primary molecule for thrombosis, and elucidated its underlying mechanisms. The PPAR-gamma agonist inhibited TF expression in response to TNF-alpha in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human monocytic leukemia cell line, and human umbilical arterial smooth muscle cells. The overexpression of TF was mediated by increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which was blocked by the PPAR-gamma agonist. The effective MAPK differed depending on each cell type. Luciferase and ChIP assays showed that transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), was a pivotal target of the PPAR-gamma agonist to lower TF transcription. Intriguingly, two main drugs for drug-eluting stent, paclitaxel or rapamycin, significantly exaggerated thrombin-induced TF expression, which was also effectively blocked by the PPAR-gamma agonist in all cell types. This PPAR-gamma agonist did not impair TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in three cell types. In rat balloon injury model (Sprague-Dawley rats, n = 10/group) with continuous paclitaxel infusion, the PPAR-gamma agonist attenuated TF expression by 70+/-5% (n = 4; P<0.0001) in injured vasculature. Taken together, rosiglitazone reduced TF expression in three critical cell types involved in vascular thrombus formation via MAPK and AP-1 inhibitions. Also, this PPAR-gamma agonist reversed the paclitaxel-induced aggravation of TF expression, which suggests a possibility that the benefits might outweigh its risks in a group of patients with paclitaxel-eluting stent implanted.","['Park, Jun-Bean', 'Kim, Baek-Kyung', 'Kwon, Yoo-Wook', 'Muller, Dominik N', 'Lee, Hyun-Chae', 'Youn, Seock-Won', 'Choi, Young-Eun', 'Lee, Sae-Won', 'Yang, Han-Mo', 'Cho, Hyun-Jai', 'Park, Kyung Woo', 'Kim, Hyo-Soo']","['Park JB', 'Kim BK', 'Kwon YW', 'Muller DN', 'Lee HC', 'Youn SW', 'Choi YE', 'Lee SW', 'Yang HM', 'Cho HJ', 'Park KW', 'Kim HS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111129,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Catheterization', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Lipoproteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Umbilical Arteries/pathology']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028327 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12911 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e28327. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028327.

ASH1 is a member of the trithorax group (trxG) that is required for proper expression of Hox genes and is preferentially expressed in haematopoietic stem cells. We have recently reported that ASH1 methylates histone H3 at lysine 36 (K36) but its biological function has remained elusive. Here we show that ASH1 regulates Hox gene expression positively and negatively in a leukemic cell line K562 and is required for myelomonocytic differentiation of murine haematopoietic stem cells. ASH1 binds to endogenous Hox loci in K562 cells and its knockdown causes reduced expression of Hox genes. In addition, ASH1 and MLL1 induce more than 100-fold activation of Hox promoters in HeLa cells if expressed simultaneously but not individually. Notably, ASH1 harbouring a point mutation that kills methyltransferase activity is more efficient than wild type ASH1 in Hox gene activation, indicating that K36 methylation is not a prerequisite for Hox gene expression. Moreover, tethering wild type or catalytically inactive methyltransferase domain of ASH1 to a heterologous promoter causes downregulation or upregulation, respectively, of transcription, supporting a hypothesis that K36 methylation imparts repression. Knockdown of ASH1 in K562 cells in vitro causes increased expression of epsilon-globin gene and reduced expression of myelomonocytic markers GPIIb and GPIIIa, whereas knockdown of ASH1 in murine haematopoietic stem cells in vivo results in decreased number of macrophages and granulocytes, a phenotype similar to that induced by loss of mll1 function. Taken together, our data suggest that ASH1 and MLL1 synergize in activation of Hox genes and thereby regulate development of myelomonocytic lineages from haematopoietic stem cells.","['Tanaka, Yujiro', 'Kawahashi, Koji', 'Katagiri, Zen-Ichiro', 'Nakayama, Yasuhiro', 'Mahajan, Milind', 'Kioussis, Dimitris']","['Tanaka Y', 'Kawahashi K', 'Katagiri Z', 'Nakayama Y', 'Mahajan M', 'Kioussis D']","['Genome Structure and Regulation, School of Biomedical Science and Biochemical Genetics, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. ytanaka.bgen@mri.tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (ASH1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Biocatalysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028171 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16999 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e28171. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028171.

Despite its successes, acquired resistance to imatinib leads to reduced drug efficacy and frequent progression of disease. Understanding the characteristics of pre-existing resistant cells is important for evaluating the benefits of first-line combination therapy with second generation inhibitors. However, due to limitations of assay sensitivity, determining the existence and characteristics of resistant cell clones at the start of therapy is difficult. Here we combined a mathematical modeling approach using branching processes with experimental data on the fitness changes (i.e., changes in net reproductive rate) conferred by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations to investigate the likelihood, composition, and diversity of pre-existing resistance. Furthermore, we studied the impact of these factors on the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our approach predicts that in most patients, there is at most one resistant clone present at the time of diagnosis of their disease. Interestingly, patients are no more likely to harbor the most aggressive, pan-resistant T315I mutation than any other resistance mutation; however, T315I cells on average establish larger-sized clones at the time of diagnosis. We established that for patients diagnosed late, the relative benefit of combination therapy over monotherapy with imatinib is significant, while this benefit is modest for patients with a typically early diagnosis time. These findings, after pre-clinical validation, will have implications for the clinical management of CML: we recommend that patients with advanced-phase disease be treated with combination therapy with at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Leder, Kevin', 'Foo, Jasmine', 'Skaggs, Brian', 'Gorre, Mercedes', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Leder K', 'Foo J', 'Skaggs B', 'Gorre M', 'Sawyers CL', 'Michor F']","['Program for Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111128,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*genetics', '*Genetic Fitness/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Mutation Rate', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027682 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-14228 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27682. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027682.

In this study, we describe a novel biological mechanism essential for survival and homeostasis of normal peripheral mature B cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, regulated by the heparin-binding cytokine, midkine (MK), and its proteoglycan receptor, the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPzeta). We demonstrate that MK initiates a signaling cascade leading to B cell survival by binding to RPTPzeta. In mice lacking PTPRZ, the proportion and number of the mature B cell population are reduced. Our results emphasize a unique and critical function for MK signaling in the previously described MIF/CD74-induced survival pathway.

To date, 19 patients have been reported. We report on a 13-year-old boy with this syndrome manifesting childhood myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He had characteristic facial features, hypospadias, and mild developmental delay. He showed neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for several years. At age 13 years, bone marrow examination was performed, which showed a sign suggestive of childhood MDS: mild dysplasia in the myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cell lineages. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) revealed a de novo 3.4 Mb 15q24.1q24.3 deletion. Although MDS has not been described in patients with the syndrome, a boy was reported to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The development of MDS and hematological malignancy in the syndrome might be caused by the haploinsufficiency of deleted 15q24 segment either alone or in combination with other genetic abnormalities in hematopoietic cells. Further hematological investigation is recommended to be beneficial if physical and hematological examination results are suggestive of hematopoietic disturbance in patients with the syndrome.","['Narumi, Yoko', 'Shiohara, Masaaki', 'Wakui, Keiko', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Yoshikawa, Kentaro', 'Amano, Yoshiro', 'Kosho, Tomoki', 'Fukushima, Yoshimitsu']","['Narumi Y', 'Shiohara M', 'Wakui K', 'Hama A', 'Kojima S', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Amano Y', 'Kosho T', 'Fukushima Y']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan. ynarumi@shinshu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

Overexpression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the lung protects against these effects, although the mechanisms are not yet clear. Hyperoxia induces cellular injury via effects on mitochondrial integrity, associated with induction of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. We hypothesized that GM-CSF protects AEC through effects on mitochondrial integrity. MLE-12 cells (a murine type II cell line) and primary murine type II AEC were subjected to oxidative stress by exposure to 80% oxygen and by exposure to H(2)O(2). Exposure to H(2)O(2) induced cytochrome c release and decreased mitochondrial reductase activity in MLE-12 cells. Incubation with GM-CSF significantly attenuated these effects. Protection induced by GM-CSF was associated with Akt activation. GM-CSF treatment also resulted in increased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1. Primary murine AEC were significantly more tolerant of oxidative stress than MLE-12 cells. In contrast to MLE-12 cells, primary AEC expressed significant GM-CSF at baseline and demonstrated constitutive activation of Akt and increased baseline expression of Mcl-1. Treatment with exogenous GM-CSF further increased Akt activation and Mcl-1 expression in primary AEC. Conversely, suppression of AEC GM-CSF expression by use of GM-CSF-specific small interfering RNA resulted in decreased tolerance of oxidative stress, Furthermore, silencing of Mcl-1 prevented GM-CSF-induced protection. We conclude that GM-CSF protects alveolar epithelial cells against oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial injury via the Akt pathway and its downstream components, including Mcl-1. Epithelial cell-derived GM-CSF may contribute to intrinsic defense mechanisms limiting lung injury.","['Sturrock, Anne', 'Seedahmed, Elfateh', 'Mir-Kasimov, Mustafa', 'Boltax, Jonathan', 'McManus, Michael L', 'Paine, Robert 3rd']","['Sturrock A', 'Seedahmed E', 'Mir-Kasimov M', 'Boltax J', 'McManus ML', 'Paine R 3rd']","['Division of Respiratory, Critical Care and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine, Univ. of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111202,United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

METHODS: A phase 1 trial was conducted to establish the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ARRY-520 given as a 1-hour infusion in either a single dose or on a day 1, 3, and 5 divided-dose schedule per cycle in patients with advanced or refractory myeloid leukemias. Additional objectives were to characterize pharmacokinetics, assess preliminary clinical activity, and explore biomarkers of KSP inhibition with ARRY-520. A total of 36 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 34) or myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 2) with a median age of 66 years (range, 21-88 years) were enrolled: 15 in the single-dose schedule (dose levels: 2.5, 3.75, 4.5, and 5.6 mg/m(2)) and 21 in the divided-dose schedule (dose levels: 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/m(2)/day). RESULTS: The MTD was 4.5 mg/m(2) total dose per cycle for both dose schedules. Dose-limiting toxicities included mucositis, exfoliative rash, hand-foot syndrome, and hyperbilirubinemia. Grades 3 or 4 reversible drug-related myelosuppression were observed in 33 of 36 patients. Plasma pharmacokinetic analyses revealed low clearance of ARRY-520 (~3 L/hour), a volume of distribution of ~450 L, and a median terminal half-life of >90 hours. Monopolar spindles were observed in blood mononuclear cells, through use of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain and antitubulin antibodies.

This calls for a better method of contraception. Immunocontraception has been proposed as a valuable alternative that can fulfill most, if not all, of the properties of an ideal contraceptive. There are several targets that are being explored for contraceptive vaccine development. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of interleukin-6 family, is required for embryo development and successful blastocyst implantation in several mammalian species. The present study was conducted to examine if LIF can be a target for the development of a birth control vaccine. Three sequences from LIF and two sequences from LIF-receptor (LIF-R) that span the regions involved in ligand-receptor binding were delineated, and peptides were synthesized based upon these sequences. Antibodies raised against these five peptides reduced LIF bioactivity in an in vitro culture assay using BA/F3 mLIF-R-mpg130 cells. Vaccines were prepared by conjugating these peptides to various carrier proteins. Immunization of female mice with these peptide vaccines induced a long-lasting, circulating as well as local antibody response in various parts of the genital tract, and resulted in a significant (P </= 0.05) inhibition in fertility in all the three trials; the LIF-R peptide vaccines proved to be a better vaccine target. The data indicate that LIF/LIF-R is an excellent target for the development of a birth control vaccine. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that examined LIF/LIF-R as a target for immunocontraception. The findings of this study can be easily translated to humans since LIF/LIF-R is also important for implantation and pregnancy in women.","['Lemons, Angela R', 'Naz, Rajesh K']","['Lemons AR', 'Naz RK']","['Reproductive Immunology and Molecular Biology Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111202,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Vaccines, Contraceptive)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contraception/adverse effects/methods', 'Contraception, Immunologic/adverse effects/*methods', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Fertility/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rabbits', 'Vaccines, Contraceptive/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrd.22002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2012 Feb;79(2):97-106. doi: 10.1002/mrd.22002.

CD40 signaling promotes proliferation and rescues B-cells from apoptosis, partly through induction of BCL2L1 and BCL2A1 and repression of BCL2. We previously showed that a stromal cell/CD40 ligand (CD154) culture system reproduced this switch in survival protein expression in primary human leukemic B-cells and we employed this model system to investigate BCL2 repression. BCL2 was post-transcriptionally regulated and the repressed BCL2 mRNA was associated with non-polysomal, but dense fractions on sucrose density gradients. Microarrays identified a set of miRNA that were induced by culture conditions and potentially able to bind to the BCL2 3'-UTR. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-125b and miR-155 repressed BCL2 mRNA but while stromal cell contact alone was sufficient to induce strongly miR-125b this did not cause BCL2 repression. miR-155, which is the most abundant miRNA under basal conditions, specifically required CD154 for further induction above a threshold to exert its full repressive effects. Anti-miR-125b and anti-miR-155 prevented CD154-mediated repression of BCL2 and reduced CD154-mediated proliferation in the MEC1 B-cell line. We suggest that miR-155 and miR-125b, which are induced by CD154 and stromal cell signals, contribute to regulating proliferation and that BCL2 is one of their target mRNAs.","['Willimott, Shaun', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Willimott S', 'Wagner SD']","['Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine and MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester LE19HN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'CD40 Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53221-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.285718 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jan 20;287(4):2608-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.285718.

Recent work has demonstrated that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression is increased in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells and that the inhibition of HO-1 in CML leads to reduced cellular growth, suggesting that HO-1 may be a plausible target for therapy. The objective of the current study was to clarify the mechanism of HO-1 overexpression and the role of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase as a contributor to this mechanism in CML. METHODS: HO-1 expression was evaluated in bone marrow specimens from patients with CML in various stages of disease, in a transplantation-based model for CML, and in CML cell lines. Chemical and genetic inhibition of the NADPH oxidase was carried out in CML cells. RESULTS: Specimens from patients with CML in blast crisis displayed higher levels of HO-1 staining than specimens from patients with CML in chronic or accelerated phase. HO-1 up-regulation in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells was suppressed by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a chemical inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Targeting the NADPH oxidase through RNA interference (RNAi) to Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a dominant-negative Rac1 construct or an inhibitor of Rac1 activity also blunted HO-1 protein expression. Moreover, inhibition of the NADPH oxidase by RNAi directed toward the 47-kd cytosolic subunit of Nox (p47phox) similarly abrogated HO-1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: BCR-ABL1 expression up-regulated HO-1, a survival factor for CML cells. This up-regulation was more pronounced in blast crisis CML relative to early stage disease and was mediated by the NADPH oxidase components Rac1 and p47phox. The expression of p47phox was increased in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells.","['Singh, Melissa M', 'Irwin, Mary E', 'Gao, Yin', 'Ban, Kechen', 'Shi, Ping', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Singh MM', 'Irwin ME', 'Gao Y', 'Ban K', 'Shi P', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Amin HM', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111202,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26621 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jul 1;118(13):3433-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26621.

Although 13q deletion as the sole abnormality has been found to confer a favorable prognosis, there are little data as to whether there is a difference in prognostic value between monoallelic versus biallelic deletion of 13q. METHODS: The authors reviewed the electronic database for patients with CLL who carried the 13q deletion as the sole abnormality and presented to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Untreated patients were separated into 2 groups: those having monoallelic versus those with biallelic deletion of 13q. Using Mann-Whitney, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier analysis, the baseline quantitative and qualitative variables for each group, along with the time from presentation to MDACC to treatment, were compared. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were identified; 143 patients had a monoallelic deletion of 13q, whereas 33 patients had a biallelic deletion. The only significantly different values between the groups were albumin (4.5 g/dL vs 4.4 g/dL; P = .01) and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression (1.7% vs 4.8%; P = .010). The median time from fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to treatment in both the monoallelic and biallelic groups had not been reached (P = not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Except for inconsequential differences in albumin and ZAP70 expression, there was no difference in the baseline characteristics between patients with CLL who had monoallelic or biallelic deletion of 13q. In addition, there was no significant difference in endpoints, including time to treatment.","['Garg, Ravin', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Keating, Michael', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Garg R', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Abruzzo L', 'Pierce S', 'Lerner S', 'Keating M', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111202,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['13q deletion syndrome'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26593 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;118(14):3531-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26593.

An abnormal immune response to common infections has emerged as a plausible candidate for triggering the proliferation of pre-leukemic clones and the fixation of secondary genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. We investigated whether evidence of infection with a specific common myelotropic childhood virus, parvovirus B19 (PVB19), relates to patterns of gene promoter DNA methylation in ALL patients. We serologically tested bone marrow samples at diagnosis of B-cell ALL for PVB19 infection and DNA methylation using a high-throughput bead array and found that 4.2% and 36.7% of samples were seroreactive to PVB19 IgM and IgG, respectively. Leukemia samples were grouped by DNA methylation pattern. Controlling for age and immunophenotype, unsupervised modeling confirmed that the DNA methylation pattern was associated with history of PVB19 (assessed by IgG, p = 0.02), but not recent infection (assessed by IgM). Replication assays on single genes were consistent with the association. The data indicate that a common viral illness may drive specific DNA methylation patterns in susceptible B-precursor cells, contributing to the leukemogenic potential of such cells. Infections may impact childhood leukemia by altering DNA methylation patterns and specific key genes in susceptible cells; these changes may be retained even after the clearance of infection.","['Vasconcelos, Gisele M', 'Christensen, Brock C', 'Houseman, E Andres', 'Xiao, Jianqiao', 'Marsit, Carmen J', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Zheng, Shichun', 'Karagas, Margaret R', 'Nelson, Heather H', 'Wrensch, Margaret R', 'Kelsey, Karl T', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Vasconcelos GM', 'Christensen BC', 'Houseman EA', 'Xiao J', 'Marsit CJ', 'Wiencke JK', 'Zheng S', 'Karagas MR', 'Nelson HH', 'Wrensch MR', 'Kelsey KT', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Wiemels JL']","['Programa de Hematologia e Oncologia Pediatricas, Centro de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*complications/immunology', '*Parvovirus B19, Human', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['18464 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.6.12.18464 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2011 Dec;6(12):1436-43. doi: 10.4161/epi.6.12.18464.,"['P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA109745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3256332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because As(2)O(3) inhibits mitochondrial respiration in leukemia cells, we hypothesized that As(2)O(3) might enhance the radiosensitivity of solid tumors by increasing tumor oxygenation [partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2))] via a decrease in oxygen consumption. Two murine models of radioresistant hypoxic cancer were used to study the effects of As(2)O(3). We measured pO(2) and the oxygen consumption rate in vivo by electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry and (19)fluorine-MRI relaxometry. Tumor perfusion was assessed by Patent blue staining. In both models, As(2)O(3) inhibited mitochondrial respiration, leading to a rapid increase in pO(2). The decrease in oxygen consumption could be explained by an observed decrease in glutathione in As(2)O(3)-treated cells, as this could increase intracellular reactive oxygen species that can disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. When tumors were irradiated during periods of As(2)O(3)-induced augmented oxygenation, radiosensitivity increased by 2.2-fold compared with control mice. Notably, this effect was abolished when temporarily clamped tumors were irradiated. Together, our findings show that As(2)O(3) acutely increases oxygen consumption and radiosensitizes tumors, providing a new rationale for clinical investigations of As(2)O(3) in irradiation protocols to treat solid tumors.","['Diepart, Caroline', 'Karroum, Oussama', 'Magat, Julie', 'Feron, Olivier', 'Verrax, Julien', 'Calderon, Pedro Buc', 'Gregoire, Vincent', 'Leveque, Philippe', 'Stockis, Julie', 'Dauguet, Nicolas', 'Jordan, Benedicte F', 'Gallez, Bernard']","['Diepart C', 'Karroum O', 'Magat J', 'Feron O', 'Verrax J', 'Calderon PB', 'Gregoire V', 'Leveque P', 'Stockis J', 'Dauguet N', 'Jordan BF', 'Gallez B']","['Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Group, Louvain Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen Consumption/*drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-1755 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1755 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;72(2):482-90. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1755.

Moreover, DLC1 loss and MKL1 nuclear localization correlate in primary human hepatocellular carcinoma. Nuclear accumulation of MKL1 in DLC1-deficient cancer cells is accomplished by activation of the RhoA/actin signaling pathway and concomitant impairment of MKL1 phosphorylation, which results in constitutive activation of MKL1/2 target genes. We provide evidence that MKL1/2 mediates cancerous transformation in DLC1-deficient hepatocellular and mammary carcinoma cells.

Although essential for preventing GVHD, T-cell depletion underlies the major reasons for transplant failure: leukemia relapse and infections, with infection-related mortality accounting for about 40% of non-leukemic deaths. Adoptive T-cell therapy would be helpful for these patients but to administer it without causing GVHD, alloreactive T cells need to be eliminated from donor T lymphocytes before infusion. In a preclinical study, to address this problem, we determined the efficacy of photodynamic purging of alloreactive T cells, by investigating combinations of parameters in order to achieve maximum allodepletion, preservation of T-regulatory cells and of pathogen and leukemia-specific T-cell responses in donor-vs-recipient MLR. We also needed to identify an optimal method to quantify the Ag-specific T-cell repertoires. Optimal procedures were identified. In particular, we compared limiting-dilution analyses (LDA) of proliferating T cells with H(3)-thymidine incorporation by bulk T cells and with flow cytometry CD25 expression, which is accepted as a T-cell activation marker.

The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of APL blasts by macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro and consequent procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity of APL cells. We found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as THP-1 and monocyte-derived macrophages bound, engulfed, and subsequently degraded immortalized APL cell line NB4 and primary APL cells. Lactadherin promoted phagocytosis of APL cells in a time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, factor Xa and prothrombinase activity of phosphatidylserine-exposed target APL cells was time-dependently decreased after incubation with phagocytes (THP-1-derived macrophages or HUVECs). Thrombin production on target APL cells was reduced by 40%-45% after 2 hours of coincubation with phagocytes and 80% by a combination of lactadherin and phagocytes. Moreover, plasmin generation of target APL cells was inhibited 30% by 2 hours of phagocytosis and approximately 50% by lactadherin-mediated engulfment. These results suggest that engulfment by macrophages and endothelial cells reduce procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity of APL blasts.

In addition to established MRD markers such as immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, fusion genes, or aberrantly expressed genes, single nucleotide mutations are considered one of the MRD markers that reflect the malignant cell clone. METHODS: We compared the quantity of mutant genes by allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (AS-qPCR) for single nucleotide mutations (TP53 410T>A and PTPN11 1508G>A) with the percentage of autologous DNA by short tandem repeat (STR)-PCR. RESULTS: Following HSCT, the quantity of mutant genes detected by AS-qPCR correlated with the percentage of autologous DNA assessed by the STR-PCR. Moreover, mutant DNAs were detected at a quantifiable level before relapse, whereas the percentage of autologous DNA was less than 5%, that is, complete chimerism. CONCLUSIONS: The AS-qPCR approach for single nucleotide mutations was accurate and highly sensitive for monitoring pre-transplantation as well as post-transplantation MRD. AS-qPCR for single nucleotide mutation is suitable for monitoring MRD in patients who lack previously established MRD markers.","['Taira, Chiaki', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Saito, Shoji', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Sugano, Mitsutoshi', 'Okumura, Nobuo', 'Honda, Takayuki']","['Taira C', 'Matsuda K', 'Saito S', 'Sakashita K', 'Sugano M', 'Okumura N', 'Honda T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, Asahi, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111125,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['*Alleles', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology/surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(11)00651-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2011.11.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2012 Feb 18;413(3-4):516-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2011.11.017.

MDSs are characterized by several recurrent cytogenetic defects, which can affect diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Some of that chromosomal alterations are associated with very poor prognosis. Conventional cytogenetics cannot accurately define the rearranged karyotype. Instead, molecular cytogenetics analyses can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information for patients affected by MDS, allowing the characterization of the whole mutational spectrum and, mainly, novel chromosomal lesions. In this paper, we report a MDS case with a novel chromosomal translocation [t(17;22)(q12;q22)], described for the first time here. Following Giemsa-banding karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, by using chromosome-specific probes, displayed the breakpoint regions at chromosomes 17 and 22, within which intra and inter-chromosomal segmental duplications (SD) are present. Because of the occurrence of SDs in breakpoint region, it was not possible to finely define the genomic regions where breaks fell. Further investigations could be required to better understand the molecular basis of the novel translocation t(17;22)(q12;q12) acting in MDS context and to explain if SDs could contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Antic, Darko', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Fekete, Marija Dencic', 'Djordjevic, Vesna', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Elezovic, Ivo']","['Antic D', 'Impera L', 'Fekete MD', 'Djordjevic V', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Elezovic I']","['Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Koste Todorovica 2, 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia. tweety@scnet.rs']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111112,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic/*diagnosis', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(11)00658-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2012 Feb 1;493(1):161-4. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.002.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy and accounts for nearly 75% of all newly diagnosed leukemias and 25% of all malignancies in childhood. The aim of the present study was to review the oral health status in children with ALL. Databases were explored using various combinations of the following keywords: ""acute lymphoblastic leukemia"", ""children"", ""inflammation"", ""pediatric"", ""periodontal disease"" and ""periodontitis"". Oral inflammatory conditions including chelitis, gingivitis, herpetic gingivostomatitis, mucositis, oral candidiasis, periodontitis and ulcerations are common manifestations in children with ALL. RESULTS: Periodontal inflammatory conditions and oral mucositis were reported to be significantly higher in children with ALL as compared to healthy controls. Tooth morphological disorders including agenesis, microdontia, short roots and developmental defects in the enamel and dentin were more often observed in children with ALL as compared to healthy controls. Children with ALL have a reduced salivary flow rate, which makes them more susceptible to dental caries as compared to healthy children. Malocclusion due to microdontia may also trigger temporomandibular joint disorders in children with ALL; however, this relationship needs further investigations. CONCLUSION: Oral inflammatory conditions including mucositis and gingivitis are common in children with ALL as compared to healthy children.

METHOD: Descriptive, retrospective, observational study of the clinical histories of patients with the FLAG-IDA regimen during the period of 2005-2010. Effectiveness was measured using objective response, progression-free interval, and global survival. Safety was measured using the NCI classification system of common toxicity criteria for adverse events. RESULTS: We registered 12 patients (52.17+/-8.26 years in women, and 54.83+/-7.22 years in men), 11 cases were acute myeloid leukaemia (5 refractory, 3 in recurrence, 1 secondary to chronic refractory myeloid leukaemia (CML) and 2 secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), one of which was refractory and the other had not been previously treated) and one case was acute refractory lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Six patients (50%) reached a complete response (CR). One patient reached a partial response (PR), which was followed by another protocol that produced a CR, two died due to disease progression, and three due to secondary complications from treatment. The progression-free interval for patients that reached a CR was 24.38 weeks (6 months). Median global survival was 8.4 weeks.

Of special note, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for this constitutional translocation (9;22)(q34;q11.2) using standard probes for BCR and ABL1 resulted in an abnormal pattern that was potentially misinterpretable as a BCR-ABL1 fusion. This is the first reported FISH analysis of a constitutional t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), and overall only the second report of such an abnormality. In light of the isolated prior report, our case also suggests that the constitutional t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) is one of the very few recurrent constitutional non-Robertsonian translocations described in humans.

Here, we present a case of de novo MDS with a normal karyotype at initial diagnosis and a mild clinical course. Five years after the initial diagnosis, investigators identified a complex rearrangement of the MLL gene without progression to acute leukemia. The 5' part of the MLL gene is fused out of frame with the LOC100131626 gene, and the 3' part of the MLL gene out of frame with the TCF12 gene. Rapid amplification of complementary DNA 3' ends yielded two main fusion transcripts, which is in concordance with the two described isoforms of the LOC100131626 gene. For both isoform-fusion transcripts, the open reading frame terminates shortly after the breakpoint that is predicted to form two de facto truncated MLL proteins and disrupts the open reading frame of the LOC100131626, TCF12, and UBE4A genes. Neither dimerization nor a transcriptional activation domain, each of which is causally linked to MLL protein-mediated transformation, is present. This and other unusual MLL rearrangements probably represent a subclass of MLL gene abnormalities that have intrinsically no ability or only a weak ability to transform hematopoeitic cells and are identified only in the context of other hematopoetic malignancies.","['Meyer, Claus', 'Kowarz, Eric', 'Yip, Sze-Fai', 'Wan, Thomas Shek-Kong', 'Chan, Tai-Kwong', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Chan, Li-Chong', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Meyer C', 'Kowarz E', 'Yip SF', 'Wan TS', 'Chan TK', 'Dingermann T', 'Chan LC', 'Marschalek R']","['Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, The Center for Drug Research, Development, and Safety (ZAFES), Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. claus.meyer@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00266-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 Oct;204(10):557-62. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.001.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Sixty-three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 18 patients with acute myeloid leukemia who attended a follow-up outpatient clinic were enrolled. Participants were required to be >8 years of age, in remission, and without any cancer treatment for at least the previous 1 year. A control group consisted of 243 subjects whose age and gender were matched with the patient group. A questionnaire consisting of 12 items was devised for fatigue measurement. RESULTS: Principal factor analysis identified three dimensions, defined as physical fatigue, decreased function, and altered mood. The mean total and the three fatigue dimension scores tended to be higher in the control group, but significant differences between the scores were seen only in the total and physical fatigue scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated an association of present older age or shorter duration after completion of treatment with total and physical fatigue, and an association of presence of total body irradiation with decreased function. CONCLUSION: Pediatric leukemia survivors in Japan experience equal or less fatigue compared with that of controls in different fatigue dimensions. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue including the differences of cultural background among different countries is necessary for future study of this issue.","['Nagai, Ayako', 'Zou, Ning', 'Kubota, Masaru', 'Kojima, Chiaki', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Usami, Ikuya', 'Okada, Masayuki', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Hamahata, Keigo', 'Matsubara, Kousaku', 'Higuchi, Manryoku', 'Imaizumi, Masue']","['Nagai A', 'Zou N', 'Kubota M', 'Kojima C', 'Adachi S', 'Usami I', 'Okada M', 'Tanizawa A', 'Hamahata K', 'Matsubara K', 'Higuchi M', 'Imaizumi M']","[""Faculty of Human Life and Environment, Nara Women's University, Nara, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120213,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200X.2011.03530.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2012 Apr;54(2):272-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2011.03530.x.

In contrast, their respective 5-Cl- and 3-Cl-substituted analogues had their adverse effects mitigated without a comparable loss of cancer cell inhibitory activity. As a result, pharmacologic space in this region of the cinnamic phenyl ring scaffold was explored. Various substituents were introduced, and their effects on cancer cell proliferation and viability were evaluated.

Here, we included an additional mutation (K39E) that could in turn further destabilize the mutant homodimer. Incorporation of this modification into CCmut2 (C38A, S41R, L45D, E48R, Q60E) generated what we termed CCmut3, and resulted in further improvements in the binding properties with the wild-type coiled-coil domain representative of Bcr-Abl [corrected]. A separate construct containing one revert mutation, CCmut4, did not demonstrate improved oligomeric properties and indicated the importance of the L45D mutation. CCmut3 demonstrated improved oligomerization via a two-hybrid assay as well as through colocalization studies, in addition to showing similar biologic activity as CCmut2. The improved binding between CCmut3 and the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil may be used to redirect Bcr-Abl to alternative subcellular locations with interesting therapeutic implications.","['Dixon, Andrew S', 'Miller, Geoffrey D', 'Bruno, Benjamin J', 'Constance, Jonathan E', 'Woessner, David W', 'Fidler, Trevor P', 'Robertson, James C', 'Cheatham, Thomas E 3rd', 'Lim, Carol S']","['Dixon AS', 'Miller GD', 'Bruno BJ', 'Constance JE', 'Woessner DW', 'Fidler TP', 'Robertson JC', 'Cheatham TE 3rd', 'Lim CS']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111212,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Engineering', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2011/12/06 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp200461s [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2012 Jan 1;9(1):187-95. doi: 10.1021/mp200461s.

Generally, it is believed that the resting energy expenditure (REE) is elevated in cancer patients and this contributes to the development of malnutrition. Thus, to be able to assess the REE is important in planning adequate nutrition support. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the REE in patients with solid tumour (n=25), leukemia (n=25) and healthy subjects (n=50) by using the indirect calorimetry method under standard conditions. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the measured REE among patients with solid tumour, leukemia and the control group (p=0.534). By contrast, there was a significant difference between the REE/kg FFM in solid tumour patients compared to the leukemia group and the healthy subjects, (p=0.049 and p=0.002). The REE derived from the Harris Benedict Equation was found to be significantly higher than the measured REE. The stress factor for patients with solid tumour was 1.35 and that for leukemia patients was 1.36. CONCLUSION: The REE/kg FFM in the cancer patients undergoing anticancer therapy appeared to be higher than expected compared to healthy subjects. The Harris Benedict Equation (HBE) was found to over-estimate the REE of cancer patients in the study. As the total energy expenditure (TEE) is estimated by multiplying the REE with the stress factor and physical activity factor, the overestimated REE from HBE will further increase the risk of overfeeding in this population.","['Khor, S M', 'Mohd, Baidi B']","['Khor SM', 'Mohd BB']","['Penang General Hospital, 10990 Pulau Pinang.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Nutr,Malaysian journal of nutrition,101286655,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', '*Rest', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/06 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Nutr. 2011 Apr;17(1):43-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the tertiary referral centre of Ampang Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, involving 105 patients. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire was used to measure their quality of life. RESULTS: The study involved patients diagnosed with all types of haematological cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and multiple myeloma (MM), with a response rate of 83.3%. The patients with ALL, HL, without NHL, and without MM were younger than other patients. There were significant differences in quality of life scores in different socio-demographic groups and types of cancer diagnosis. The global quality of life of the female patients was much better than that of the male patients. Patients who were 40 years old or younger had a better global quality of life and physical functioning, as well as fewer symptoms of constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Employed patients were in less pain but showed greater impairments of cognitive function than did unemployed patients. Patients who earned a monthly wage of RM1000 or less had reduced physical function, more symptoms of pain, and more financial difficulties compared with patients who earned more. Patients with AML tended to have better physical functioning than did patients with MM, whose physical functioning was impaired. Comparatively, more symptoms of dyspnoea were found in ALL and HL patients than in other types of lymphoma. Compared with other patients, those with ALL had a greater loss of appetite, and other lymphoma patients had fewer symptoms of pain. Patients with NHL had impaired role functioning and more constipation compared with other patients. The results were all statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The quality of life of haematological cancer patients is affected by socio-demographic factors and clinical diagnoses. Efforts should be made to improve the overall quality of life of these patients.","['Priscilla, Das', 'Hamidin, Awang', 'Azhar, Md Zain', 'Noorjan, Kon', 'Salmiah, Md Said', 'Bahariah, Khalid']","['Priscilla D', 'Hamidin A', 'Azhar MZ', 'Noorjan K', 'Salmiah MS', 'Bahariah K']","['Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Med Sci,The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,101126308,,,,2011/12/03 06:00,2011/12/03 06:01,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Med Sci. 2011 Jul;18(3):49-56.,,PMC3216227,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['haematological malignancies', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma', 'oncology', 'quality of life', 'socioeconomic factors']",,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to describe the risk factors in patients with mastoid abscess following acute and chronic otitis media and discuss the management of this infection. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was done on all patients who underwent mastoidectomy for mastoid abscess from January 2002 to December 2007. Data on the patients' presentation, associated complications, management, and follow-up were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were enrolled in this study population. Group A consisted of patients with mastoid abscess preceded by acute otitis media, while Group B consisted of patients with mastoid abscess and chronic otitis media. In Group A (n = 7), 4 patients had a pre-morbid immunocompromised condition, but they did not have cholesteatoma. None of the patients in Group B (n = 5) had any pre-morbid illnesses. Out of 12 patients, 7 patients had associated extracranial complications, and 1 patient had intracranial complications. Most patients recovered well after mastoidectomy. Recurrence was noted in 1 patient who had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Mastoid abscess is still a recognised complication of acute otitis media, especially in patients who are immunocompromised. Immunocompetent patients may also develop mastoid abscess following chronic otitis media associated with cholesteatoma. Thus, early treatment of otitis media and close vigilant follow-up are advocated to ensure prompt detection of mastoid abscess complications.","['Ami, Mazita', 'Zakaria, Zahirrudin', 'Goh, Bee See', 'Abdullah, Asma', 'Saim, Lokman']","['Ami M', 'Zakaria Z', 'Goh BS', 'Abdullah A', 'Saim L']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Med Sci,The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,101126308,,,,2010/10/01 00:00,2010/10/01 00:01,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Med Sci. 2010 Oct;17(4):44-50.,,PMC3216184,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['abscess', 'cholesteatoma', 'complications', 'immunocompromised patient', 'mastoiditis', 'otitis media', 'otolyngology; head neck']",,,,,,,,,

We previously found that retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), a transcription factor activated by retinoic acid (RA), mediates both granulocytic and osteoblastic differentiation. This effect depends on decreased phosphorylation of serine 77 of RARalpha (RARalphaS77) by the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) complex, a key cell-cycle regulator. In this article, we report that, by suppressing CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha, RA induces FGF8f to mediate osteosarcoma U2OS cell differentiation in an autocrine manner. By contrast, paracrine FGF8f secreted into osteoblast-conditioned medium by U2OS cells transduced with FGF8f or a phosphorylation-defective RARalphaS77 mutant, RARalphaS77A, bypasses RA stimuli to cross-mediate granulocytic differentiation of different types of human leukemic myeloblasts and normal primitive hematopoietic CD34(+) cells, possibly through modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Further experiments using recombinant human FGF8f (rFGF8f) stimuli, antibody neutralization, and peptide blocking showed that paracrine FGF8f is required for mediating terminal leukemic myeloblast differentiation. These studies indicate a novel regulatory mechanism of granulocytic differentiation instigated by RA from the HSC niche, which links loss of CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha with paracrine FGF8f-mediated MAPK signaling to mediate leukemic myeloblast differentiation in the absence of RA. Therefore, these findings provide a compelling molecular rationale for further investigation of paracrine FGF8f regulation, with the intent of devising HSC niche-based FGF8f therapeutics for myeloid leukemia, with or without RA-resistance.","['Chaudhry, Parvesh', 'Yang, Xiaochun', 'Wagner, Michael', 'Jong, Ambrose', 'Wu, Lingtao']","['Chaudhry P', 'Yang X', 'Wagner M', 'Jong A', 'Wu L']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles Saban Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111201,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (FGF8 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '148997-75-5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 8/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Osteoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0584 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0584 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Feb;11(2):267-76. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0584.

Experiments revealed a non-voltage-activated, noninactivating K(+) current. The magnitude of the current recorded under whole cell conditions was inhibited by an increase in free intracellular Mg(2+) concentration. Activation or inactivation of the Mg(2+)-inhibited K(+) current (MIP) was paralleled by activation or inactivation of a Mg(2+)-inhibited TRPM7-like current displaying characteristics indistinguishable from those reported for molecularly identified TRPM7 current. The MIP and TRPM7 currents were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors. However, inhibition of the MIP current was temporally distinct from inhibition of TRPM7 current, allowing for isolation of the MIP current. Isolation of the MIP conductance revealed a current reversing near the K(+) equilibrium potential, indicative of a highly K(+)-selective conductance. Consistent with this finding, coactivation of the nonselective cation current TRPM7 and the MIP current following dialysis with nominally Mg(2+)-free pipette solution resulted in hyperpolarized whole cell reversal potentials, consistent with an important role for the MIP current in the setting of a negative resting membrane potential. The MIP and TRPM7-like conductances were constitutively expressed under in vivo conditions of intracellular Mg(2+), as judged by their initial detection and subsequent inactivation following dialysis with a pipette solution containing 5 mM free Mg(2+). The MIP current was blocked in a voltage-dependent fashion by extracellular Cs(+) and, to a lesser degree, by Ba(2+) and was blocked by extracellular La(3+) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. MIP currents were unaffected by blockers of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, human ether-a-go-go-related gene current, and intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. In addition, the MIP current displayed characteristics distinct from conventional inwardly rectifying K(+) channels. A similar current was detected in the leukemic cell line CHRF-288-11, consistent with this current being more generally expressed in cells of leukemic origin.","['Mason, Michael J', 'Schaffner, Catherine', 'Floto, R Andres', 'Teo, Quok An']","['Mason MJ', 'Schaffner C', 'Floto RA', 'Teo QA']","['Department of Physiology, Development, and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, UK. mjm39@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111130,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The presence of atopic disease has been shown to protect against developing childhood ALL. The aim of this study was to examine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity genes previously associated with atopic disease, can elucidate the inverse association between childhood ALL and atopic disease. We studied 525 children, including 192 with childhood ALL, 149 with atopic disease and 184 healthy control subjects. We compared genotype distributions of 29 SNPs in genes of TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR9, TLR10 and CD14 between the three groups and corrected for multiple testing. The genotype distributions of two SNPs in the TLR6 gene, rs5743798 and rs6531666, differed significantly between children with ALL, children with atopic disease and control subjects. Particularly in children with atopic eczema, risk alleles for atopic disease were observed more often than in control subjects, and less often in children with ALL than in control subjects. These findings support the immune surveillance hypothesis as an explanation for the protective association of atopic disease on childhood ALL. Further investigation is warranted to examine in more detail the role of innate immunity in the development of childhood ALL.","['Miedema, K G E', 'Tissing, W J E', 'Te Poele, E M', 'Kamps, W A', 'Alizadeh, B Z', 'Kerkhof, M', 'de Jongste, J C', 'Smit, H A', 'de Pagter, A P', 'Bierings, M', 'Boezen, H M', 'Postma, D S', 'de Bont, E S J M', 'Koppelman, G H']","['Miedema KG', 'Tissing WJ', 'Te Poele EM', 'Kamps WA', 'Alizadeh BZ', 'Kerkhof M', 'de Jongste JC', 'Smit HA', 'de Pagter AP', 'Bierings M', 'Boezen HM', 'Postma DS', 'de Bont ES', 'Koppelman GH']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111202,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (TLR6 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 6)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Asthma/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Toll-Like Receptor 6/*genetics']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011341 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.341 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1203-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.341.

Moreover, we also show that in vivo expression of the active CD29 on PC was clearly diminished in a minority of MM cases (HUTS21(-) patients). HUTS21(-) cells were refractory to the addition of either normal allogeneic BM plasma or optimal concentrations of exogenous divalent cations and recombinant sCD106. Furthermore, a lower binding to fibronectin was detected in comparison with HUTS21(+) PC.

While antioxidants may impede the efficacy of chemotherapy by scavenging reactive oxygen species and free radicals, it is also possible that antioxidants alleviate unwanted chemotherapy-induced toxicity, thus allowing for increased chemotherapy doses. These contradictory assertions suggest that antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy treatment can have varied outcomes depending on the cellular context. To gain a more robust understanding of the role that antioxidants play in chemotherapy, we investigated the dose-dependent effects of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on the redox-mediated regulation of intracellular signaling. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effect of Dox-induced ROS on the NF-kappaB pathway in a pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line by measuring the thiol-based oxidative modifications of redox-sensitive proteins within the pathway. We report a functional consequence of NAC supplementation during doxorubicin (Dox) chemotherapy administration via the NF-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signal transduction pathway. The ability of NAC to alter Dox-induced NF-kappaB activity is contingent on the ROS-mediated S-glutathionylation of IKK-beta. Moreover, the NAC-dependent alteration of intracellular glutathione redox balance, through pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, can be exploited to either promote or inhibit Dox-induced NF-kappaB activity in an NAC-concentration-dependent manner. We developed an electron-transfer-based computational model that predicts the effect of NAC pretreatment on Dox-induced NF-kappaB signaling for a range of NAC and Dox treatment combinations.","['Finn, Nnenna Adimora', 'Kemp, Melissa Lambeth']","['Finn NA', 'Kemp ML']","['The Wallace H.

He died of multiorgan failure only 5 days after diagnosis of ALL had been established. Autopsy revealed systemic leukemic infiltrations. We suppose that the mass of tumor cells induced a cascade of metabolic and endocrine reactions, which not only triggered the rapid progression of the disease but were also accountable for the lack of response to treatment.

Association of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels with an increased risk for infection in previous studies was contradictory. The aim of this study was to determine whether MBL deficiency is associated with the risk of infections in pediatric oncology patients. Before the start of chemotherapy a blood sample was taken from 75 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MBL serum concentration was measured using a commercially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Twenty patients had concentrations under 1000 microg/L, defining MBL deficiency and the remaining 55 patients had concentrations >1000 microg/L. Ten patients suffered from more than 1 episode of severe infection. Sixty-five percent of patients with MBL below 1000 microg/mL suffered from 2 or more episodes of infections (3 of 16 individuals with 1 severe infection; 10 of 16 with 2 and 3 of 16 with 3), in contrast to only 29 of 55 (52%) patients with MBL above 1000 microg/mL (19 of 27 individuals with 1 severe infection and 10 of 27 with 2). The difference between 2 groups was significant (P<0.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To explore, at high resolution, the frequency and size of alterations affecting this locus in adult BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to investigate their prognostic value, 112 patients (101 de novo and 11 relapsed cases) were analyzed by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and gene candidate deep exon sequencing. Paired diagnosis-relapse samples were further available and analyzed for 19 (19%) cases. RESULTS: CDKN2A/ARF and CDKN2B genomic alterations were identified in 29% and 25% of newly diagnosed patients, respectively. Deletions were monoallelic in 72% of cases, and in 43% of them, the minimal overlapping region of the lost area spanned only the CDKN2A/B gene locus. An analysis conducted at relapse showed an increase in the detection rate of CDKN2A/ARF loss (47%) compared with the time of diagnosis (P = 0.06). Point mutations within the 9p21 locus were found at very low levels, with only a nonsynonymous substitution in the exon 2 of CDKN2A. Of note, deletions of CDKN2A/B were significantly associated with poor outcomes in terms of overall survival (P = 0.0206), disease free-survival (P = 0.0010), and cumulative incidence of relapse (P = 0.0014). CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the 9p21 locus by genomic deletion is a frequent event in BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. Deletions are frequently acquired during leukemia progression and are a poor prognostic marker of long-term outcomes.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Trino, Stefania', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Cattina, Federica', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Foa, Robin', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Ferrari A', 'Lonetti A', 'Papayannidis C', 'Paoloni F', 'Trino S', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Ottaviani E', 'Cattina F', 'Impera L', 'Abbenante MC', 'Vignetti M', 'Vitale A', 'Potenza L', 'Paolini S', 'Soverini S', 'Pane F', 'Luppi M', 'Foa R', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences ""L. and A.

For analysis of key regulators of apoptosis and differentiation, gene expression profiles were performed in NB4 cells. Realgar was found to induce apoptosis and differentiation in both cell lines, and these effects were exerted simultaneously. Gene expression profiles indicated that genes influenced by realgar treatment were involved in the modulation of signal transduction, translation, transcription, metabolism and the immune response.

IM has high efficacy, however some individuals develop a resistance due to impaired bioavailability. Polymorphisms in genes encoding membrane transporters such as ABCB1 have been associated with differences in protein expression and function that influence the response to several drugs. AIM: To investigate the relationship of ABCB1 polymorphisms with markers of response to IM in patients with CML. METHODS: One hundred eighteen CML patients initially treated with a standard dose of IM (400mg/day) for 18months were selected at two health centers in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. The response criteria were based on the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. ABCB1 polymorphisms c.1236C>T (rs1128503), c.3435C>T (rs1045642) and c.2677G>T/A (rs2032582) were evaluated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: ABCB1 polymorphisms were not related with a risk for CML in this sample population (p<0.05). In the CML group, frequencies of ABCB1 SNPs were similar between responder and non-responder patients (p>0.05). In the responder group, the frequency of ABCB11236CT/2677GT/3435CT haplotype was higher in patients with major molecular response (MMR) (51.7%) than in patients without MMR (8.3%, p=0.010). Furthermore, carriers of this haplotype had increased the probability of reaching the MMR compared with the non-carriers (OR: 11.8; 95% CI: 1.43-97.3, p=0.022).

Early operations led to the waterborne release of radioactive materials into the small Techa River. Residents living downstream used river water for drinking and other purposes. The releases and subsequent flooding resulted in deposition of sediments along the shoreline and on floodplain soil. Primary routes of exposure were external dose from the deposited sediments and ingestion of 90Sr and other radionuclides. Study of the Techa River Cohort has revealed an increased incidence of leukemia and solid cancers. Epidemiologic studies are supported by extensive dose-reconstruction activities that have led to various versions of a Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The correctness of the TRDS has been challenged by the allegation that releases of short-lived radionuclides were much larger than those used in the TRDS. Although the dosimetry system depends more upon measurements of 90Sr in humans and additional measurements of radionuclides and of exposure rates in the environment, a major activity has been undertaken to define more precisely the time-dependent rates of release and their radionuclide composition. The major releases occurred during 1950-1951 in the form of routine releases and major accidental releases. The reevaluated amount of total release is 114 PBq, about half of which was from accidents that occurred in late 1951. The time-dependent composition of the radionuclides released has also been reevaluated. The improved understanding presented in this paper is possible because of access to many documents not previously available.","['Degteva, M O', 'Shagina, N B', 'Vorobiova, M I', 'Anspaugh, L R', 'Napier, B A']","['Degteva MO', 'Shagina NB', 'Vorobiova MI', 'Anspaugh LR', 'Napier BA']","['Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation. marina@urcrm.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Radioactive Waste)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Strontium Radioisotopes)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Plutonium', 'Radioactive Waste/*analysis', 'Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Radiometry', 'Rivers', 'Russia', 'Strontium Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Water Pollution, Radioactive/*analysis']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e318228159a [doi]', '00004032-201201000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2012 Jan;102(1):25-38. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e318228159a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, studies in cultured cells have indicated that each of these genetic alterations creates a selective sensitivity to ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway inhibition. Here, we describe a genetic system to conditionally reduce ATR expression to 10% of normal levels in adult mice to compare the impact of this suppression on normal tissues and cancers in vivo. Hypomorphic suppression of ATR minimally affected normal bone marrow and intestinal homeostasis, indicating that this level of ATR expression was sufficient for highly proliferative adult tissues. In contrast, hypomorphic ATR reduction potently inhibited the growth of both p53-deficient fibrosarcomas expressing H-rasG12V and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) driven by MLL-ENL and N-rasG12D. Notably, DNA damage increased in a greater-than-additive fashion upon combining ATR suppression with oncogenic stress (H-rasG12V, K-rasG12D, or c-Myc overexpression), indicating that this cooperative genome-destabilizing interaction may contribute to tumor selectivity in vivo. This toxic interaction between ATR suppression and oncogenic stress occurred without regard to p53 status. These studies define a level of ATR pathway inhibition in which the growth of malignancies harboring oncogenic mutations can be suppressed with minimal impact on normal tissue homeostasis, highlighting ATR inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy.","['Schoppy, David W', 'Ragland, Ryan L', 'Gilad, Oren', 'Shastri, Nishita', 'Peters, Ashley A', 'Murga, Matilde', 'Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar', 'Diehl, J Alan', 'Brown, Eric J']","['Schoppy DW', 'Ragland RL', 'Gilad O', 'Shastri N', 'Peters AA', 'Murga M', 'Fernandez-Capetillo O', 'Diehl JA', 'Brown EJ']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute and Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111201,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'Fibrosarcoma/genetics/therapy', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['58928 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI58928 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Jan;122(1):241-52. doi: 10.1172/JCI58928.

Upregulation of SET is essential to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A in chronic myeloid leukemia, but its importance in acute myeloid leukemia has not yet been explored. DESIGN AND METHODS: We quantified SET expression by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 214 acute myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis. Western blot was performed in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and in 16 patients' samples. We studied the effect of SET using cell viability assays. Bioinformatics analysis of the SET promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the transcriptional regulation of SET. RESULTS: SET overexpression was found in 60/214 patients, for a prevalence of 28%. Patients with SET overexpression had worse overall survival (P<0.01) and event-free survival (P<0.01). Deregulation of SET was confirmed by western blot in both cell lines and patients' samples. Functional analysis showed that SET promotes proliferation, and restores cell viability after protein phosphatase 2A overexpression. We identified EVI1 overexpression as a mechanism involved in SET deregulation in acute myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SET overexpression is a key mechanism in the inhibition of PP2A in acute myeloid leukemia, and that EVI1 overexpression contributes to the deregulation of SET. Furthermore, SET overexpression is associated with a poor outcome in acute myeloid leukemia, and it can be used to identify a subgroup of patients who could benefit from future treatments based on PP2A activators.","['Cristobal, Ion', 'Garcia-Orti, Laura', 'Cirauqui, Cristina', 'Cortes-Lavaud, Xabier', 'Garcia-Sanchez, Maria A', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Cristobal I', 'Garcia-Orti L', 'Cirauqui C', 'Cortes-Lavaud X', 'Garcia-Sanchez MA', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pio XII-55 31008 Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Chaperones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recurrence', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.050542 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.050542 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Apr;97(4):543-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.050542.

In addition, combination treatments required evaluation. Therefore, individual patient data were sought for all randomized trials in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia which involved a purine analog, but which did not include antibody therapies. Sixteen trials were found, addressing seven comparisons. Eight trials, with 2,753 patients, showed that single agent purine analog improved progression free survival (odds ratio=0.71; 95% confidence interval=0.63-0.79). Heterogeneity remained substantial. Three trials, with 1,403 patients, showed that progression free survival was further improved by the addition of cyclophosphamide (odds ratio=0.54; 0.47-0.62). Fewer data were available on the addition of other drugs to purine analog, and none showed clear benefit. Two trials, with 544 patients, suggested cladribine improved progression free survival compared to fludarabine (odds ratio=0.77; 0.63-0.95). No differences were seen in overall survival for any comparisons. In conclusion, purine analogs, particularly combined with cyclophosphamide, significantly improve progression free survival but not survival.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B conducted a study to determine if these results could be reproduced in a multi-institutional setting. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 69 patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma at least 18 years of age and at least stage II. Radiaton therapy was not permitted on study. Median age was 58 years (range 23-83) and 40% had high-intermediate or high International Prognostic Index risk. Immunohistochemical biomarkers for cell of origin and proliferation were performed. RESULTS: With a median follow up of 62 months, time to progression and overall survival were 81% and 84%, respectively, and time to progression was 87%, 92% and 54% for low/low-intermediate, high-intermediate and high International Prognostic Index risk groups, respectively, at 5-years and beyond. The time to progression and event-free survival of germinal center B-cell lymphoma were 100% and 94%, respectively, and non-germinal center B-cell GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were 67% and 58%, respectively, at 62 months (germinal center vs. non-germinal center B cell P=0.008). DA-EPOCH-R was tolerated without significant grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first confirmation by a multi-institutional group that DA-EPOCH-R provides high durable remissions in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and is effective in both germinal center and non-germinal center B-cell subtypes.

A significant difference in overall survival was observed between patients with severe neutropenia (28 months) and patients with a neutrophil count higher than 0.5x10(9)/L (66 months) (p<0.0001). Also, severe neutropenia predicted a significantly reduced on leukemia-free survival (p<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, severe neutropenia retained its independent prognostic influence on overall survival [HR: 2.19, 95% CI (1.41-3.10), p<0.0001] and leukemia free survival [HR: 3.51, 95% CI (1.97-6.26), p<0.0001].

Several strains of NDV were reported to induce cytolysis to cancerous cell lines. It has prompted much interest as anticancer agent because it can replicate up to 10,000 times better in human cancer cells than in most normal cells. In this study, two NDV strains, viserotropic-velogenic strain AF2240 and lentogenic strain V4-UPM, showed cytolytic activity and apoptosis induction against Mouse myelomoncytic leukemia (WEHI 3B). The cytolytic effects of NDV strains were determined using microtetrazolium (MTT) assay. The cytolytic dose - fifty percent (CD(50)) were 2 and 8HAU for AF2240 and V4-UPM strains, respectively. Cells treated with NDV strains showed apoptotic features compared to the untreated cells under fluorescence microscope. NDV induced activation of caspase-3 and DNA laddering in agarose gel electrophoresis which confirmed the apoptosis. The anti-leukemic activity of both strains was evaluated on myelomoncytic leukemia BALB/c mice. The results indicated that both NDV strains significantly decreased liver and spleen weights. It also decreased blasts cell percentage in blood, bone marrow and spleen smears of treated mice (p<0.05). Histopathological studies for spleen and liver confirmed the hematological results of blood and bone marrow. From the results obtained, the exposure to both NDV stains AF2240 and V4-UPM showed similar results for Ara-c.

When tested in a cell-free assay, both compounds were found to be potent competitive inhibitors of CYP24A1, with the cyclopropylamine analog 3 exhibiting an 80-1 selective inhibition of CYP24A1 over CYP27B1. Addition of 3 to a mouse osteoblast culture sustained the level of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), further demonstrating its effectiveness in CYP24A1 inhibition. Importantly, the in vitro effects on human promyeloid leukemia (HL-60) cell differentiation by 3 were nearly identical to those of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and in vivo the compound showed low calcemic activity.

However the mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells is poorly understood. METHODS: K562 and HL-60 cells were transfected with pRS-15/16 or pRS-E, cell growth were measured by CCK-8 assay and direct cell count. Meanwhile WT1 protein and mRNA level were measured by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: In this study we found that over-expression of miR-15a/16-1 significantly inhibited K562 and HL-60 cells proliferation. Enforced expression of miR-15a/16-1 in K562 and HL-60 cells significantly reduced the protein level of WT1 but not affected the mRNA level. However enforced expression of miR-15a/16-1 can not reduce the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region(3'UTR) of WT1. Silencing of WT1 by specific siRNA suppressed leukemic cells proliferation resembling that of miR-15a/16-1 over-expression. Anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides (AMO) reversed the expression of WT1 in K562 and HL-60 cells. Finally, we found a significant inverse correlation between miR-15a or miR-16-1 expression and WT1 protein levels in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that miR-15a/16-1 may function as a tumor suppressor to regulate leukemic cell proliferation potentially by down-regulating the WT1 oncogene. However WT1 is not directly targeted by miR-15a/16-1 through miRNA-mRNA base pairing, therefore more study are required to understand the mechanism by which miR-15a/16-1 downregulate WT1.","['Gao, Shen-meng', 'Xing, Chong-yun', 'Chen, Chi-qi', 'Lin, Si-si', 'Dong, Pei-hong', 'Yu, Fu-jun']","['Gao SM', 'Xing CY', 'Chen CQ', 'Lin SS', 'Dong PH', 'Yu FJ']","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-110 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-110 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Dec 1;30:110. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-110.,,PMC3245444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides antimitochondrial antibodies, the autoantibody profile of PBC includes antinuclear antibodies (ANA) which are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence in up to 50% of PBC patients. Two immunofluorescence patterns are considered 'PBC-specific': the multiple nuclear dots and rim-like/membranous patterns. The target antigens of the multiple nuclear dots pattern have been identified as Sp100 and promyelocytic leukemia protein, whereas the rim-like/membranous pattern is given by autoantibodies recognizing multiple proteins such as gp210, nucleoporin p62 and the lamin B receptor. Other ANA, especially those already known in the rheumatological setting, such as anticentromere, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-dsDNA antibodies, can be frequently found in PBC, often coexisting in the same patient.

Once inside the cell, these drugs must be phosphorylated to their active forms. In contrast, some members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family have been identified as responsible for the efflux of the phosphorylated forms of these nucleoside-derived drugs.

Fluctuations of its activity have been reported in some pathological conditions and its mRNA levels have been proposed as a prognostic factor for poor outcome in patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia. As a member of the oxypurine cycle, cN-II is involved in the regulation of intracellular concentration of 5'-inosine monophosphate (IMP), 5'-guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and also 5-phosphoribose 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and is therefore involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine de novo and salvage synthesis. In addition, several studies demonstrated the involvement of cN-II in pro-drug metabolism. Notwithstanding some publications indicating that cN-II is essential for the survival of several cell types, its role in cell metabolism remains uncertain. To address this issue, we built two eucaryotic cellular models characterized by different cN-II expression levels: a constitutive cN-II knockdown in the astrocytoma cell line (ADF) by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy and a cN-II expression in the diploid strain RS112 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Preliminary results suggest that cN-II is essential for cell viability, probably because it is directly involved in the regulation of nucleotide pools. These two experimental approaches could be very useful for the design of a personalized chemotherapy.","['Filoni, Daniela Nicole', 'Pesi, Rossana', 'Careddu, Maria Giovanna', 'Camici, Marcella', 'Allegrini, Simone', 'Collavoli, Anita', 'Scarfone, Ilaria', 'Zucchi, Francesca', 'Galli, Alvaro', 'Tozzi, Maria Grazia']","['Filoni DN', 'Pesi R', 'Careddu MG', 'Camici M', 'Allegrini S', 'Collavoli A', 'Scarfone I', 'Zucchi F', 'Galli A', 'Tozzi MG']","['Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/*metabolism"", 'Astrocytoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/03/22 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15257770.2011.628355 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2011 Dec;30(12):1155-60. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2011.628355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings suggest that MTHFR 677 gene variants have no significant influence on the susceptibility to CML in a Serbian population.","['Jakovljevic, Ksenija', 'Malisic, Emina', 'Cavic, Milena', 'Radulovic, Sinisa', 'Jankovic, Radmila']","['Jakovljevic K', 'Malisic E', 'Cavic M', 'Radulovic S', 'Jankovic R']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. jankovicr@ncrc.ac.rs']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120103,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', 'Serbia', 'Young Adult']",2011/12/03 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2011/12/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.645210 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1327-30. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.645210.

We previously identified IER5 as one of the 2,3,4-tribromo-3-methyl-1-phenylphospholane 1-oxide (TMPP)-induced transcriptional responses in AML cells, using microarrays that encompassed the entire human genome. However, the biochemical pathway and mechanisms of IER5 function in regulation of the cell cycle remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of IER5 in the cell cycle and in cell proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We found that the over-expression of IER5 in AML cell lines and in AML-derived ALDH(hi) (High Aldehyde Dehydrogenase activity)/CD34(+) cells inhibited their proliferation compared to control cells, through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and a decrease in Cdc25B expression. Moreover, the over-expression of IER5 reduced colony formation of AML-derived ALDH(hi)/CD34(+) cells due to a decrease in Cdc25B expression. In addition, over-expression of Cdc25B restored TMPP inhibitory effects on colony formation in IER5-suppressed AML-derived ALDH(hi)/CD34(+) cells. Furthermore, the IER5 reduced Cdc25B mRNA expression through direct binding to Cdc25B promoter and mediated its transcriptional attenuation through NF-YB and p300 transcriptinal factors. In summary, we found that transcriptional repression mediated by IER5 regulates Cdc25B expression levels via the release of NF-YB and p300 in AML-derived ALDH(hi)/CD34(+) cells, resulting in inhibition of AML progenitor cell proliferation through modulation of cell cycle. Thus, the induction of IER5 expression represents an attractive target for AML therapy.","['Nakamura, Satoki', 'Nagata, Yasuyuki', 'Tan, Lin', 'Takemura, Tomonari', 'Shibata, Kiyoshi', 'Fujie, Michio', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Tanaka, Yasutaka', 'Toda, Mitsuo', 'Makita, Reiko', 'Tsunekawa, Kenji', 'Yamada, Manabu', 'Yamaoka, Mayumi', 'Yamashita, Junko', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Yamashita, Mitsuji']","['Nakamura S', 'Nagata Y', 'Tan L', 'Takemura T', 'Shibata K', 'Fujie M', 'Fujisawa S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Toda M', 'Makita R', 'Tsunekawa K', 'Yamada M', 'Yamaoka M', 'Yamashita J', 'Ohnishi K', 'Yamashita M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan. satonaka@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (IER5 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (NFYB protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*genetics']",2011/12/02 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028011 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13699 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e28011. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028011.

Because malignant transformation is often associated with altered expression of cell surface glycans, we evaluated the interaction of ArtinM with human myelocytic leukemia cells and investigated cellular responses to lectin binding. The intensity of ArtinM binding varied across 3 leukemia cell lines: NB4>K562>U937. The binding, which was directly related to cell growth suppression, was inhibited in the presence of Manalpha1-3(Manalpha1-6)Manbeta1, and was reverted in underglycosylated NB4 cells. ArtinM interaction with NB4 cells induced cell death (IC(50) = 10 microg/mL), as indicated by cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential unassociated with caspase activation or DNA fragmentation. Moreover, ArtinM treatment of NB4 cells strongly induced reactive oxygen species generation and autophagy, as indicated by the detection of acidic vesicular organelles in the treated cells. NB4 cell death was attributed to ArtinM recognition of the trimannosyl core of N-glycans containing a ss1,6-GlcNAc branch linked to alpha1,6-mannose. This modification correlated with higher levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V transcripts in NB4 cells than in K562 or U937 cells. Our results provide new insights into the potential of N-glycans containing a beta1,6-GlcNAc branch linked to alpha1,6-mannose as a novel target for anti-leukemia treatment.","['Carvalho, Fernanda Caroline', 'Soares, Sandro Gomes', 'Tamarozzi, Mirela Barros', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Roque-Barreira, Maria-Cristina']","['Carvalho FC', 'Soares SG', 'Tamarozzi MB', 'Rego EM', 'Roque-Barreira MC']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular e Molecular e Bioagentes Patogenicos, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2011/12/02 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027892 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11191 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27892. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027892.
