The prognostic significance of CXCR4 expression in patients with AML that have a normal karyotype and no evidence of FLT3 gene mutations was examined. METHODS: The prognostic significance of CXCR4 expression in 122 AML patients with normal karyotype and no evidence of FLT3 gene mutation treated at our institution between 1997 and 2003 was analyzed. All patients received intensive chemotherapy according to institutional protocols; 84% received cytarabine-containing regimens. Bone marrow biopsy or clot specimens obtained before treatment were immunostained for CXCR4. RESULTS: There were 70 men and 52 women with a median age of 62 years (range, 22-82 years). Median follow-up was 18 months (range, <1-97 months). Seventy-six patients achieved complete remission (CR); 39 had recurrence. Sixty-six patients died, including 9 with no evidence of disease. CXCR4 was positive in 70 and negative in 52 patients, with CR rates of 58% and 71%, respectively (P = .09). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CXCR4 expression, presence of multilineage dysplasia, and high creatinine level predicted poorer overall (OS) and event-free (EFS) survival. CONCLUSIONS.: The results suggest that CXCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients with an unmutated FLT3 gene.","['Konoplev, Sergej', 'Rassidakis, Georgios Z', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Liakou, Chrysoula I', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Konoplev S', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Liakou CI', 'Huang X', 'Xiao L', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene and ZAP70 protein expression have been reported as prognostic indicators. However, these assays are not widely available and their concordance is imperfect. Thus a need exists to identify additional molecular determinants of CLL. The Igbeta (CD79b) subunit of the B cell antigen receptor is essential for B lymphocyte function. Defects in Igbeta expression are implicated in CLL pathogenesis. We have analyzed Igbeta mRNA expression in CLL cells in 40 consecutive patient samples. About 75% of the samples showed the expected decrease of Igbeta surface staining. Igbeta mRNA levels covered a wider range, did not correlate with Igbeta surface staining, but clearly distinguished the normal and CLL lymphocyte populations. Remarkably, Igbeta mRNA levels correlated strongly with SHM; Igbeta mRNA levels in CLL cells were significantly higher in patients with an unmutated IgV(H) gene when compared with those in whom IgV(H) was hypermutated (P = 0.008). In contrast, no correlation was observed between Igbeta mRNA levels and ZAP70 expression. Multiple parameters abstracted from chart reviews were used to estimate severity of CLL in each case. While severity correlated strongly with ZAP70 staining, and to a lesser extent with SHM status, there was no correlation with Igbeta mRNA levels. These data establish a strong linkage between Igbeta mRNA expression and SHM in CLL and highlight the complex relationships between biochemical parameters and clinical status in this disease.","['Cajiao, Isabela', 'Sargent, Rachel', 'Elstrom, Rebecca', 'Cooke, Nancy E', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Liebhaber, Stephen A']","['Cajiao I', 'Sargent R', 'Elstrom R', 'Cooke NE', 'Bagg A', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'CD79 Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20885 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2007 Aug;82(8):712-20. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20885.,"['R01 HD025147/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD25147/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this study was to document complete and partial cytogenetic responses to imatinib in all phases of CML. Secondary objectives included evaluations of complete hematologic response, safety, time to progression, and survival. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five patients in all phases of CML who received treatment with imatinib from January 2001 to December 2005 were included in the study. All patients had on bone marrow or BCR-ABL positive in peripheral blood by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 18 months, major cytogenetic responses (Ph <35%) in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blastic phase (BP) were documented in 61%, 57%, and 28% of patients, respectively. A complete cytogenetic response was observed in 39.4%, 35.7%, and 14.3% of patients in CP, AP, and BP, respectively; and a complete hematologic response was observed in 90%, 86%, and 30%, respectively. The median time to progression at 18 months was 91% in CP and 68% in AP. The overall survivals in CP, AP, and BP at 18 months was 92%, 74%, and 38%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Impressive hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to imatinib were observed, similar to the responses reported in patients from Western countries.

Intensive chemotherapy is an accepted form of therapy for patients with higher risk MDS. The comparative efficacy of these 2 forms of treatment in MDS is unknown. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS. METHODS: The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B). A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491 patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, decitabine was associated with a survival advantage compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS. Future studies should evaluate prospectively the results of decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in this setting.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Davisson, Jan', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Huang X', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Shan J', 'Davisson J', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Few clinical trials have been available for older patients who are not considered fit for an intensive chemotherapy approach. METHODS: Between December 1998 and November 2003, as part of National Cancer Research Institute Acute Myeloid Leukemia 14 Trial, 217 patients, who were deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy were randomized to receive low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (20 mg twice daily for 10 days) or hydroxyurea with or without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). RESULTS: Low-dose ara-C produced a better remission rate (18% vs 1%; odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.06-0.37; P = .00006) and better overall survival (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81; P = .0009), which was accounted for by the achievement of complete remission (CR) (duration of CR: 80 weeks vs 10 weeks for patients with no CR). Patients who had adverse cytogenetics did not benefit. ATRA had no effect. Toxicity scores or supportive care requirements did not differ between the treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Older, less fit patients have a poor outcome, and few trials have been conducted in this patient group. Low-dose ara-C treatment was superior to best supportive care and hydroxyurea because it had greater success in achieving CR, and it could represent standard care against which new treatments may be compared in this patient group.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Prentice, Archie G', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'McMullin, Mary F', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Wheatley, Keith']","['Burnett AK', 'Milligan D', 'Prentice AG', 'Goldstone AH', 'McMullin MF', 'Hills RK', 'Wheatley K']","['Department of Haematology, Wales School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Risk', 'Survival', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/05/22 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22496 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Mar 15;109(6):1114-24. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22496.,['G0300133/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,['Cancer. 2007 Mar 15;109(6):1007-10.

Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent inducer of myeloma cell apoptosis, however, this antimyeloma activity is inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG) released from osteoblasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific agonists of TRAIL death receptors would not be inhibited by OPG released from osteoblasts and thus may represent a novel therapeutic approach in multiple myeloma. In the present study, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was demonstrated to be mediated through both DR4 and DR5. Specific agonist antibodies to DR4 or DR5 dose-dependently induced myeloma cell apoptosis, which was not prevented by OPG or by medium conditioned by osteoblasts. Co-culture of myeloma cells with osteoblasts protected against TRAIL-induced apoptosis of myeloma cells, and this protective effect was due to OPG. In contrast, the co-culture of myeloma cells with osteoblasts had no protective effect on apoptosis induced by specific agonists of DR4 or DR5. TRAIL has been proposed as a potential antitumour therapy, but within the bone marrow microenvironment OPG may interfere with the action of TRAIL. Specific agonists of TRAIL death receptors would not be subject to this inhibition and thus may provide an alternative specific antimyeloma therapy.","['Locklin, R M', 'Croucher, P I', 'Russell, R G G', 'Edwards, C M']","['Locklin RM', 'Croucher PI', 'Russell RG', 'Edwards CM']","['Nuffield Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Institute of Musculoskeletal Sciences, Botnar Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/physiology', 'Osteoprotegerin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/agonists/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404518 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404518 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):805-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404518.

Despite recent advances in the treatment, MM remains an incurable disease. This calls for an effort to develop novel therapeutics in order to eradicate the disease. Here we have evaluated the potential antimyeloma action of Pemetrexed, an antifolate drug that has shown promising results in other neoplastic diseases. Pemetrexed had a potent antimyeloma effect on cell lines sensitive and resistant to conventional therapeutic agents, and was also efficient on fresh cells from patients and in a murine MM model. Furthermore, Pemetrexed abrogated the protective action on MM cell death of several growth factors produced by the bone marrow microenvironment. Mechanistic studies indicated that Pemetrexed provoked this action by a combined effect that included cell cycle blockade, probably by p21 upregulation, and induction of apoptosis through caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These data, together with the fact that Pemetrexed is already licensed for the therapy of other neoplastic diseases, opens the possibility for the inclusion of Pemetrexed in the therapeutic armamentarium to battle MM.","['Ramirez, J M', 'Ocio, E M', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Pandiella, A']","['Ramirez JM', 'Ocio EM', 'San Miguel JF', 'Pandiella A']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutamates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Pemetrexed', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404599 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404599 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):797-804. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404599.

Here, we report that ectopic expression of p210(BCR-ABL) in the megakaryoblastic Mo7e cell line and in primary human CD34(+) progenitors trigger erythroid differentiation at the expense of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation. Clonal culture of purified CD41(+)CD42(-) cells, a population highly enriched in MK progenitors, combined with the conditional expression of p210(BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase activity by imatinib identified a true lineage reprogramming. In both Mo7e or CD41(+)CD42(-) cells transduced with p210(BCR-ABL), lineage switching was associated with a downregulation of the friend leukemia Integration 1 (FLI-1) transcription factor. Re-expression of FLI-1 in p210(BCR-ABL)-transduced Mo7e cells rescued the megakaryoblastic phenotype. Altogether, these results demonstrate that alteration of signal transduction via p210(BCR-ABL) reprograms MK cells into erythroid cells by a downregulation of FLI-1. In addition, our findings underscore the role of kinases in lineage choice and infidelity in pathology and suggest that downregulation of FLI-1 may have important implications in CML pathogenesis.","['Buet, D', 'Raslova, H', 'Geay, J-F', 'Jarrier, P', 'Lazar, V', 'Turhan, A', 'Morle, F', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Louache, F']","['Buet D', 'Raslova H', 'Geay JF', 'Jarrier P', 'Lazar V', 'Turhan A', 'Morle F', 'Vainchenker W', 'Louache F']","['INSERM, U790, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404600 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404600 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):917-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404600.

We thus investigated survivin expression in myeloma cells and its role in MM biology to evaluate its potential interest as a target in MM treatment. Our results describe the cancer-specific overexpression of survivin in myeloma cells and show a significant correlation between survivin expression at protein level and clinical course of MM. Moreover, survivin knockdown by RNA interference led to growth rate inhibition of myeloma cells related to apoptosis induction and deep cell-cycle disruption. Finally, survivin knockdown sensitized myeloma cells to conventional anti-myeloma agents.

Several studies have recently suggested a potential protective effect of folic acid on certain pediatric cancers. The protective role of prenatal multivitamins has not been elucidated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the potential protective effect of prenatal multivitamins on several pediatric cancers. Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Toxline, Healthstar, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published in all languages from 1960 to July 2005 on multivitamin supplementation and pediatric cancers. References from all articles collected were reviewed for additional articles. Two blinded independent reviewers assessed the articles for inclusion and exclusion. Rates of cancers in women supplemented with multivitamins were compared with unsupplemented women using a random effects model. Sixty-one articles were identified in the initial search, of which, seven articles met the inclusion criteria. There was an apparent protective effect for leukemia (odds ratio (OR)=0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.50-0.74), pediatric brain tumors (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.60-0.88) and neuroblastoma (OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.42-0.68). In conclusion, maternal ingestion of prenatal multivitamins is associated with a decreased risk for pediatric brain tumors, neuroblastoma, and leukemia. Presently, it is not known which constituent(s) among the multivitamins confer this protective effect.","['Goh, Y I', 'Bollano, E', 'Einarson, T R', 'Koren, G']","['Goh YI', 'Bollano E', 'Einarson TR', 'Koren G']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toronto, and The Motherisk Program, Division of Clinical Pharmacology/Toxicology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,['0 (Vitamins)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Care', 'Vitamins/*therapeutic use']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['6100100 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.clpt.6100100 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2007 May;81(5):685-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.clpt.6100100.

Hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced protein 1 (HEXIM1) inhibits P-TEFb in cooperation with 7SK RNA, but direct evidence that this inhibition limits the replication of HIV-1 has been lacking. In the present study we examined whether the expression of FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 (HEXIM1-f) affected lentiviral replication in human T cell lines. METHODS: HEXIM1-f was introduced to five human T cell lines, relevant host for HIV-1, by murine leukemia virus vector and cells expressing HEXIM1-f were collected by fluorescence activated cell sorter. The lentiviral replication kinetics in HEXIM1-f-expressing cells was compared with that in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cells. RESULTS: HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus replicated less efficiently in HEXIM1-f-expressing cells than in GFP-expressing cells of the five T cell lines tested. The viral revertants were not immediately selected in culture. In contrast, the replication of vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 was not limited. The quantitative PCR analyses revealed that the early phase of viral life cycle was not blocked by HEXIM1. On the other hand, Tat-dependent transcription in HEXIM1-f-expressing cells was substantially repressed as compared with that in GFP-expressing cells. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HEXIM1 is a host factor that negatively regulates lentiviral replication specifically. Elucidating the regulatory mechanism of HEXIM1 might lead to ways to control lentiviral replication.","['Shimizu, Saki', 'Urano, Emiko', 'Futahashi, Yuko', 'Miyauchi, Kosuke', 'Isogai, Maya', 'Matsuda, Zene', 'Nohtomi, Kyoko', 'Onogi, Toshinari', 'Takebe, Yutaka', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Komano, Jun']","['Shimizu S', 'Urano E', 'Futahashi Y', 'Miyauchi K', 'Isogai M', 'Matsuda Z', 'Nohtomi K', 'Onogi T', 'Takebe Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Komano J']","['AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HEXIM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*physiology', 'Plasmids', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/QAD.0b013e32801424a5 [doi]', '00002030-200703120-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,AIDS. 2007 Mar 12;21(5):575-82. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0b013e32801424a5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrodifferentiation process revealed a reversion of the senecent differentiated cells back to undifferentiated and proliferative active young cells. A significant protein ubiquitination was detectable before retrodifferentiation and rejuvenation indicating a proteolytic down-modulation of differentiation markers. Thus, proteolytic activity significantly increased during retrodifferentiation, however, proteasomal protein expression remained unaltered. In order to investigate proteasomal associates, (ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression progressively increased to maximal levels at the time of retrodifferentiation suggesting a possible regulatory association. Indeed, PARP-1 immunoprecipitations demonstrated a co-immunoprecipitation of proteolytically active 20S proteasome with maximal levels during retrodifferentiation. Inhibition of PARP and the proteasome by 3-aminobenzamide and MG-132, respectively, revealed about 90% of apoptotic cells by cell cycle analysis at the time of retrodifferentiation whereas control cells doubled. In contrast, a similar PARP and proteasome inhibition within 5d after TPA-induced differentiation demonstrated little if any apoptotic effects. More specifically, down-modulation of PARP-1 by an antisense PARP-1 vector construct underwent a rapid differentiation and aging and revealed no detectable retrodifferentiation in contrast to control vector-transfected U937 cells. In conclusion, retrodifferentiation of growth-arrested U937 monocytic cells requires proteasomal protein degradation and activity of PARP-1.","['Selle, Astrid', 'Ullrich, Oliver', 'Harnacke, Katja', 'Hass, Ralf']","['Selle A', 'Ullrich O', 'Harnacke K', 'Hass R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neurobiology, Institute of Anatomy, Medical Faculty Charite, Humboldt University Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Exp Gerontol,Experimental gerontology,0047061,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Phenotype', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0531-5565(06)00448-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exger.2006.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Gerontol. 2007 Jun;42(6):554-62. doi: 10.1016/j.exger.2006.12.004.

DESIGN: Controlled animal experiment. SETTING: Animal research and laboratory facility. ANIMAL(S): Lif null, Hoxa10 null, and ICR mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial tissue was collected during the peri-implantation period and after ovariectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometrial epithelial tissue was examined under scanning-electron microscopy and assigned a score depending on the number of pinopodes present. RESULT(S): Pinopode scores in ICR, Lif null, and Hoxa10 null mice were comparable throughout the peri-implantation period, rising on day 3.5 of pregnancy and remaining elevated through to day 7.5, suggesting that pinopodes are not a good indicator of receptivity in mice. In contrast, pinopode scores in rats clearly demarcated the window of receptivity, appearing on day 4 of pregnancy and declining sharply on day 6. Pinopode scores were low in E(2)-treated ovariectomized mice, but unexpectedly, pinopode scores in vehicle-injected ovariectomized ICR mice were markedly elevated.

The remaining 144 lung carcinoma cases included 45 cases with squamous cell carcinoma, 62 with adenocarcinoma, 23 with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), 7 with large cell carcinoma, 5 with pleomorphic carcinoma, 1 with carcinoid, and 1 with adenosquamous carcinoma. Forty of the 144 cases were PML protein positive in the nucleus, 26 were PML protein positive in the cytoplasm, and 12 were PML protein positive in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Among the 5 cases with benign lung tumors, two cases with pulmonary leiomyomas had strong expression of PML. Among the 7 normal pulmonary tissues, one case with bronchial mucosa had a moderate expression of PML on the nuclei in the basilar part, and the 6 cases with normal alveolar epithelium did not express PML. The rates of PML expression on cell nuclei were 31.4% and 8.7% respectively in the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and SCLC samples (chi(2) = 4.968, P = 0.026). Farish, but not strong, expression on cytoplasm was found in 39.1% cases of SCLC and in 14% cases of NSCLC (chi(2) = 6.609, P = 0.010). PML protein was found in 9 patients with SCLC, but absent in the other 14 cases. The 5-year cumulative survival rate of the PML positive SCLC patients was 50%, significantly higher than that of the PML-negative SCLC patients (23%, chi(2) = 3.931, P = 0.047). Lack of PML protein (RR = 0.127, 95% CI = [0.027, 0.592]) and senior pathologic TNM stage (RR = 3.148, 95% CI = [1.029, 9.631]) were two hazardous factors that influenced long-term survival of postoperative SCLC patients. CONCLUSION: As an important suppressor of tumor, PML may be a useful indicator to predict postoperative prognosis in patients with SCLC.","['Zhao, Zhi-long', 'Huang, Qing-yuan', 'Xu, Shun', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Zhao, Hui-ru']","['Zhao ZL', 'Huang QY', 'Xu S', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao HR']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, First hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/statistics & numerical data', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis/methods', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2007/02/23 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Dec 19;86(47):3362-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the role of this gene in lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed global gene expression data to quantify PKC-beta expression across diagnostic groups and, when possible, determined correlations between PKC-beta expression and survival. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the level of PKC-beta expression was highest in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma. Within diffuse large-B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), PKC-beta expression was significantly higher in activated B-cell- like subtype than germinal center B-cell- like subtype (P < 0.0001). Elevated PKC-beta appeared to be associated with worse survival in both of these subtypes. When analyzed within clinically defined risk groups established by the International Prognostic Index (IPI), PKC-beta expression was lowest in patients with low IPI scores (0-1). Within intermediate- and high-risk IPI groups, elevated PKC-beta expression was associated with worse survival, suggesting that PKC-beta may expand the prognostic value of the IPI. Results of global gene expression analyses of DLBCL samples corroborate previous observations that anti-apoptosis, cell proliferation, and B-cell proliferation signaling pathways are functionally related to PKC-beta. CONCLUSION: We present a first detailed pharmacogenomics report comparing PKC-beta mRNA expression across different lymphoid malignancies and evaluating it as an outcome predictor. Our findings suggest that DLBCL patients with elevated PKC-beta have a worse prognosis, indicating that further evaluation of PKC-beta as a chemotherapeutic target for lymphoid malignancies is warranted.","['Li, Shuyu', 'Phong, Mark', 'Lahn, Michael', 'Brail, Leslie', 'Sutton, Susan', 'Lin, Boris K', 'Thornton, Donald', 'Liao, Birong']","['Li S', 'Phong M', 'Lahn M', 'Brail L', 'Sutton S', 'Lin BK', 'Thornton D', 'Liao B']","['Integrative Biology Informatics, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA. lish@lilly.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biol Direct,Biology direct,101258412,,,,2007/02/23 09:00,2007/02/23 09:01,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:01 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1745-6150-2-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1745-6150-2-8 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Direct. 2007 Feb 21;2:8. doi: 10.1186/1745-6150-2-8.,,PMC1805741,,,,20070221,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we highlight two cases in which the cytogenetic studies challenge the common practice of using hematologic and morphologic changes as key factors in malignant disease management. The first case is that of a lymph node sample from a 40-yr-old non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patient sent for determination of disease progress. Hematologic studies showed no evidence of transformation to high-grade NHL (>15% blasts with rare mitotic figures). Cytogenetic studies of lymph node showed multiple clonal abnormalities, most notably a der(18) from a t(14;18) which is associated with high-grade NHL. After two cycles of chemotherapy with fludarabine, the patient did not show any clinical response, suggesting possible progression to high-grade lymphoma. The second case is of a patient with a history of human immunodeficiency virus and blastic natural killer leukemia/lymphoma. Hematologic studies of ascitic fluid classified the patient as having pleural effusion lymphoma whereas bone marrow analysis showed no malignancy. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies showed multiple clonal abnormalities including a t(8;14), which is commonly associated with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). To our knowledge, this is the first case wherein a morphologically normal bone marrow showed presence of clonal abnormalities consistent with BL or Pleural effusion lymphoma. After two cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy, the patient's general condition and ascitis improved and she was discharged. These studies clearly demonstrate that genetic changes often precede morphologic changes in a developing malignant condition. Therefore, the critical information needed for care of patients with malignant disorders may be incomplete or inaccurate if cytogenetic evaluation is overlooked.","['Northup, Jill K', 'Gadre, Swarupa A', 'Ge, Yimin', 'Lockhart, Lillian H', 'Velagaleti, Gopalrao V N']","['Northup JK', 'Gadre SA', 'Ge Y', 'Lockhart LH', 'Velagaleti GV']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH798 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00798.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Feb;78(2):152-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00798.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, during treatment, lack of physical activity and treatment cause various short- to long-term side effects, such as muscle atrophy and physical deconditioning. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an intrahospital, short-duration (8 weeks) exercise training program on muscle strength and endurance and functional mobility of children with ALL. Seven children (4 boys and 3 girls; 4-7 years of age) who were in the maintenance phase of treatment for ALL were selected as subjects. Three training sessions of 90- to 120-minute duration were performed each week. Each session included 11 different strength exercises engaging the major muscle groups and aerobic training. Gains in strength and endurance were assessed with a 6 repetition maximum test for upper (seated bench press and seated lateral row) and lower extremities (leg press). Gains in functional mobility were assessed with the time up and go test (TUG) and the timed up and down stairs test (TUDS). Performance was significantly improved after the training program in all strength tests (p < 0.01 for seated bench press and p < 0.05 for both seated lateral row and seated leg press) and in the TUG test (p < 0.05). In summary, a period of time as short as 8 weeks is enough to produce clinically relevant early-phase adaptations in children receiving treatment against ALL (i.e., improved functional mobility and muscle strength).

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but only a small subset of patients are eligible for transplantation, and until recently there were few options other than supportive care for transplant-ineligible patients. Since 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three new therapies specifically for the indication of MDS: two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine and decitabine) and an immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide). Several other drugs are used by clinicians for treatment of patients with MDS, but are not specifically FDA-approved for this indication. With several therapeutic options available, yet none of them effective in the majority of cases, it can be challenging for clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient. Here we discuss a risk-based management approach to MDS that incorporates recent data regarding these new therapies. While many questions remain about the optimal use of newer agents, the long-standing perception of MDS as a syndrome where therapeutic nihilism is the only realistic approach is slowly beginning to change.","['Steensma, David P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Steensma DP', 'Tefferi A']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. steensma.david@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sideroblastic/drug therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Deferasirox', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-11/therapeutic use', 'Iron Chelating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use']",2007/02/23 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2007/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['169322 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2007 Jan;21(1):43-54; discussion 57-8, 62.",['CA90628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,124,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA microarrays were used to profile a set of 54 adult ALL specimens from the Medical Research Council UKALL XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E2993 trial (21 p185BCR-ABL-positive, 16 p210BCR-ABL-positive and 17 BCR-ABL-negative specimens). RESULTS: Using supervised and unsupervised analysis tools, we detected significant transcriptomic changes in BCR-ABL-positive versus -negative specimens, and assessed their validity in an independent cohort of 128 adult ALL specimens. This set of 271 differentially expressed genes (including GAB1, CIITA, XBP1, CD83, SERPINB9, PTP4A3, NOV, LOX, CTNND1, BAALC, and RAB21) is enriched for genes involved in cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, and hematologic system development and function. Network analysis demonstrated complex interaction patterns of these genes, and identified FYN and IL15 as the hubs of the top-scoring network. Within the BCR-ABL-positive subgroups, we identified genes overexpressed (PILRB, STS-1, SPRY1) or underexpressed (TSPAN16, ADAMTSL4) in p185BCR-ABL-positive ALL relative to p210BCR-ABL-positive ALL. Finally, we constructed a gene expression- and interaction-based outcome predictor consisting of 27 genes (including GRB2, GAB1, GLI1, IRS1, RUNX2, and SPP1), which correlated with overall survival in BCR-ABL-positive adult ALL (P = .0001), independent of age (P = .25) and WBC count at presentation (P = .003). CONCLUSION: We identified prominent molecular features of BCR-ABL-positive adult ALL, which may be useful for developing novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in this disease.","['Juric, Dejan', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Ramsey, Meghan C', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', ""O'Dwyer, Peter J"", 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Sikic, Branimir I']","['Juric D', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Ramsey MC', 'Racevskis J', 'Wiernik PH', 'Rowe JM', 'Goldstone AH', ""O'Dwyer PJ"", 'Paietta E', 'Sikic BI']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5151, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.09.3534 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.09.3534 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10;25(11):1341-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.3534.

The molecular mechanism of this strain-specific apoptosis in PRM was studied. The apoptosis elicited in C3H mouse PRM 4 h after exposure was effectively blocked by proteasome inhibitors. Irradiation-induced disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol were also suppressed by a proteasome inhibitor but not by a caspase inhibitor. To determine whether the apoptosis occurred due to a depletion of antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 family proteins were examined. Irradiation markedly decreased the level of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bax, A1, or cIAP1. Mcl-1's depletion was suppressed by a proteasome inhibitor but not by a caspase inhibitor. The amount of Mcl-1 was well correlated with the rate of apoptosis in C3H mouse PRM exposed to irradiation and not affected by irradiation in radioresistant B6 mouse PRM. Irradiation increased rather than decreased the Mcl-1 mRNA expression in C3H mouse PRM. On the other hand, Mcl-1 protein synthesis was markedly suppressed by irradiation. Global protein synthesis was also suppressed by irradiation in C3H mouse PRM but not in B6 mouse PRM. The down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression with Mcl-1-specific small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotide significantly induced apoptosis in both C3H and B6 mouse PRM without irradiation.

We demonstrate that proteasome-dependent regulation of Mcl-1 plays a critical role in renal tubular epithelial cell injury from cisplatin. Protein levels of Mcl-1 rapidly declined in a time-dependent manner following cisplatin treatment of LLC-PK(1) cells. However, mRNA levels of Mcl-1 were not altered following cisplatin treatment. Expression of other antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-2 and BclxL was not affected by cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin-induced loss of Mcl-1 occurs at the same time as the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and initiation of apoptosis. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, revealed rapid turnover of Mcl-1. In addition, treatment with cycloheximide in the presence or absence of cisplatin demonstrated that cisplatin-induced loss of Mcl-1 results from posttranslational degradation rather than transcriptional inhibition. Overexpression of Mcl-1 protected cells from cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Preincubating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or lactacystin not only restored cisplatin-induced loss of Mcl-1 but also resulted in an accumulation of Mcl-1 that exceeded basal levels; however, Bcl-2 and BclxL levels did not change in response to MG-132 or lactacystin. The proteasome inhibitors effectively blocked cisplatin-induced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. These studies suggest that proteasome regulation of Mcl-1 is crucial in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and that Mcl-1 is an important therapeutic target in cisplatin injury to renal tubular epithelial cells.","['Yang, Cheng', 'Kaushal, Varsha', 'Shah, Sudhir V', 'Kaushal, Gur P']","['Yang C', 'Kaushal V', 'Shah SV', 'Kaushal GP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Adjuvant chemotherapy has recently improved overall control for these patients. We added adjuvant chemotherapy to control presumed micrometastatic disease and then randomized patients to receive radiation therapy (RT) or observation to determine the benefit of local radiation consolidation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient eligibility required histologically documented stage IIIA (radiographically occult N2) NSCLC that was completely resected, with no known residual disease, surgical staging per protocol requirements, Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0/1, no previous chemotherapy or RT, and minimal laboratory values. All eligible patients received 4 cycles of paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 over 3 hours with carboplatin at an area under the curve of 6 on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 beginning 4-8 weeks after surgery. Two to 4 weeks after chemotherapy, patients were randomized to receive RT as 5000 cGy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or observation. RESULTS: The study closed after 2 years because of slow accrual. Forty-four patients entered the study; 2 were ineligible, and 5 were not randomized because of progression, adverse reaction, or patient withdrawal. Thirty-seven patients were the basis of this analysis. Median failure-free survival was 16.8 months on the observation arm and 33.7 months on the RT arm, with a 1-year survival rate of 72% on the observation arm and 74% on the RT arm. There were no statistical differences between the observation and RT arms for failure-free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSION: In this small study, consolidation RT after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIA NSCLC did not significantly improve outcome for this high-risk population.","['Perry, Michael C', 'Kohman, Leslie J', 'Bonner, James A', 'Gu, Lin', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Perry MC', 'Kohman LJ', 'Bonner JA', 'Gu L', 'Wang X', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['University of Missouri/Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, Columbia, MO 65203, USA. perrym@health.missouri.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Lung Cancer,Clinical lung cancer,100893225,"['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-7304(11)70514-9 [pii]', '10.3816/CLC.2007.n.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lung Cancer. 2007 Jan;8(4):268-72. doi: 10.3816/CLC.2007.n.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional rare, and sometimes cytogenetically cryptic, translocations involving the TCF3 gene have also been described. Using a dual color split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, we have investigated the involvement of this gene in a series of BCP-ALLs harboring 19p13 translocations, as well as an unselected patient cohort. The TCF3 gene was shown to be involved in the majority of cases with a cytogenetically visible t(1;19) translocation, while the remaining TCF3-negative ALLs demonstrated breakpoint heterogeneity. Although most ""other"" 19p13 translocations did not produce a split-signal FISH pattern, a novel t(13;19)(q14;p13) involving TCF3 was discovered. A prospective screen of 161 children with BCP-ALL revealed a cryptic t(12;19)(p13;p13), another novel TCF3 rearrangement, and a series of patients with submicroscopic deletions of TCF3. These results demonstrate the utility of a split-signal FISH strategy in confirming the involvement of the TCF3 gene in 19p13 rearrangements and in identifying novel and cryptic TCF3 translocations. In addition to its role as a fusion partner gene, we propose that TCF3 can also act as a tumor suppressor gene in BCP-ALL.","['Barber, Kerry E', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Broadfield, Zoe J', 'Stewart, Adam R M', 'Wright, Sarah L', 'Martineau, Mary', 'Strefford, Jon C', 'Moorman, Anthony V']","['Barber KE', 'Harrison CJ', 'Broadfield ZJ', 'Stewart AR', 'Wright SL', 'Martineau M', 'Strefford JC', 'Moorman AV']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20431 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 May;46(5):478-86. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20431.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stat3 is classified as a proto-oncogene, because an activated form of Stat3 can mediate oncogenic transformation in cultured cells and tumour formation in nude mice. The constitutive activation of Stat3 has been frequently detected in various types of human cancers. However, the constitutive activation of Stat3 in endometrial and cervical cancers has not been studied. We examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (activated form of Stat3) in multiple endometrial and cervical cancer tissues using tissue microarray slides as well as cancer cell lines to explore the possible activation of Stat3. Our results indicated that elevated phosphorylation of Stat3 was detected in cervical and endometrial cancer cell lines. Our results also showed that elevated levels of phosphorylation of Stat3 protein were detected in the endometrial and cervical cancer specimens. This is the first study to demonstrate that Stat3 is activated in human endometrial and cervical cancer tissues. Immunohistochemical staining showed that activated Stat3 is associated with increased expression of downstream antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-xL, survivin, and Mcl-1 in these tissues. Expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 mutant using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of Stat3 phosphorylation. Further, a JAK/Stat3 small molecular inhibitor, JSI-124, induced apoptosis more selectively in HeLa and SiHa cancer cell lines than Ishikawa cell line without elevated levels of Stat3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that Stat3 is activated in human endometrial and cervical cancers and the inhibition of constitutive Stat3 signaling may be an effective target for cancer intervention in these two cancers.","['Chen, C-L', 'Hsieh, F-C', 'Lieblein, J C', 'Brown, J', 'Chan, C', 'Wallace, J A', 'Cheng, G', 'Hall, B M', 'Lin, J']","['Chen CL', 'Hsieh FC', 'Lieblein JC', 'Brown J', 'Chan C', 'Wallace JA', 'Cheng G', 'Hall BM', 'Lin J']","[""Center for Childhood Cancer, Columbus Children's Research Institute, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'bcl-X Protein/drug effects/genetics']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['6603597 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6603597 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2007 Feb 26;96(4):591-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603597.,,PMC2360038,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inducible expression of SSBP2 causes growth arrest and partial differentiation in AML cells. Here, we report that the adenoviral oncoprotein E1B55K directly binds to endogenous SSBP2 protein and sequesters it into juxtanuclear bodies in adenovirally transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Similarly, transient expression of E1B55K in IMR90 fibroblasts and HeLa cells result in the formation of juxtanuclear bodies containing SSBP2. When nuclear export of E1B55K is prevented, SSBP2 remains associated with E1B55K in nuclear foci. A requirement for intact microtubules to retain the integrity of the juxtanuclear bodies suggests them to be E1B55K containing aggresomes. The adenoviral E1B55K protein has been shown to localize to the Mre11 complex and p53 to aggresome structures; together with the viral E4orf6 protein, E1B55K recruits a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase that induces degradation of Mre11 and p53. However, our present studies reveal that E1B55K does not degrade SSBP2. These data demonstrate that E1B55K targets the candidate leukemia suppressor SSBP2 and suggest that subverting its function may contribute to cell transformation by viral oncoproteins.","['Fleisig, H B', 'Orazio, N I', 'Liang, H', 'Tyler, A F', 'Adams, H P', 'Weitzman, M D', 'Nagarajan, L']","['Fleisig HB', 'Orazio NI', 'Liang H', 'Tyler AF', 'Adams HP', 'Weitzman MD', 'Nagarajan L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SSBP2 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Acute Disease', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210281 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210281 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jul 19;26(33):4797-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210281.

In different clinical trials Fotemustine showed a remarkable antitumor activity as single agent, and in association with other antineoplastic compounds or treatment modalities. Moreover, its toxicity is generally considered acceptable. The drug has been employed in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and, on the basis of its pharmacokinetic properties, in brain tumors, either primitive or metastatic. Moreover, Fotemustine shows pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of mono-functional alkylating compounds (e.g. DNA methylating drugs, such as Temozolomide), that have been recently considered for the management of acute refractory leukaemia.

The treatment of this extremely serious disease should be accompanied not only with number of already described complications which are thus expected but also with rare ones, whose control and treatment is demanding and rather long-term. The immense progress in medical research makes it possible to cope with a variety of serious diseases including leukaemia in young patients with one-year intensive therapy and an overall exhaustion of their organisms, where in spite of a perfect therapeutic protocol new challenges need to be met. The present study describes one of such rare complications, which appeared in two three-year-old girl patients, accidentally during the same time period: namely benign oesophagus stenosis. The condition was caused by several factors - first mycotic infection, histologically proved as Candida Albicans - which in one of the girls lead to septic states and the condition was generalised with more affected organs. Due to the location of the stenosis in the lower third of oesophagus, gastrooesophagus reflux played its role, too and last but not least there was a negative effect of one of the cytostatics - methotrexate - causing mycotic infections (here stomatitis and oesophagitis). For the proper development and overall well-being of a healthy organism, an optimal, sufficient and appropriate per oral reception of food is necessary. Satisfying this need becomes even more crucial in the case of young patient otherwise affected by an immunodeficient condition and an overall impoverishment of their organism. The oesophagus stenosis presents an obstacle manageable using either endoscopic methods or surgery. Although in the cases discussed the treatment was very demanding due to the age of the patients, continuous cytostatic therapy in progress, the primary disease, and the general anaesthesia - it was finally effective and successful.","['Svobodovda, D', 'Slany, J', 'Klvana, P', 'Blazek, B', 'Curik, R']","['Svobodovda D', 'Slany J', 'Klvana P', 'Blazek B', 'Curik R']","['Klinika detskeho lekarstvi FNsP, Ostrava. dita.svobodova@fnspo.cz']",['cze'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,IM,"['Candidiasis/complications', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esophageal Stenosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Esophagitis/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",2007/02/22 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2007;146(1):77-80; discussion 80-1.,,,,,,,,,,,Neobvykla komplikace akutni lymfoblasticke leukemie u detskych pacientu.,,,,,,,

GC sensitivity is an important prognostic factor in ALL treatment, and it is used to classify patients into risk groups. Clinical assessment for GC sensitivity is very time-consuming, however. We have recently found that granzyme A (GZMA) mediates GC-induced apoptosis in ALL-derived cell line 697. In this study we examined the correlation between GC sensitivity and GC-induced GZMA expression by using seven established cell lines derived from ALL patients. The apoptosis assay showed four cell lines were GC-sensitive and three were GC-resistant. GC treatment markedly enhanced GZMA expression in GC-sensitive cell lines only, and not in GC-resistant cell lines. GC-induced GZMA expression also correlated well with the amount of GC-induced apoptosis. GC-induced GZMA expression could thus be a useful early biomarker for ""personalized"" ALL therapy.","['Myoumoto, Akira', 'Nakatani, Kaoru', 'Koshimizu, Taka-Aki', 'Matsubara, Hiroshi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Tsujimoto, Gozoh']","['Myoumoto A', 'Nakatani K', 'Koshimizu TA', 'Matsubara H', 'Adachi S', 'Tsujimoto G']","['Department of Genomic Drug Discovery Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Drug Discovery Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Drug Discovery Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Drug Discovery Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. gtsuji@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Granzymes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2007/02/21 09:00,2007/07/04 09:00,['2007/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10038-007-0119-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10038-007-0119-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2007;52(4):328-333. doi: 10.1007/s10038-007-0119-4.

Donor KIR genotypes and recipient HLA KIR ligands were analyzed in 60 AML patients receiving T-cell replete, HLA-matched-related donor allogeneic bone marrow transplants.

Multivariate analysis found C1/C2 status to be an independent predictor for mortality (P=0.007, HR 2.54, confidence interval 1.29-5.00). C1/C2 heterozygosity was also associated with a delayed time to platelet engraftment, particularly for those with concurrent HLA-Bw4 expression (P=0.003).

It is known that T cells isolated from HAM patients possess strong ability for cell proliferation in vitro and mRNA of various cytokines are abundantly expressed in CNS tissues of HAM patients. Hence, the cytokine-induced proliferation could have an important role in pathogenesis and immune responses of HAM. In this study, we examined the relationship between cell proliferation and ability of in vitro cytokine production of CD4(+) T cell clones isolated from HAM patients. We started a culture from a single cell to isolate cell clones immediately after drawing blood from the patients using limiting dilution method, which could allow the cell to avoid in vitro HTLV-I infection after initiation of culture. Many cell clones were obtained and the rate of proliferation efficiency from a single cell was as high as 80%, especially in the 4 weeks' culture cells from HAM patients. These cells were classified as mainly Th0 phenotype that produce both IFN-gamma and IL-4 after CD3-stimulation. However, the frequency of proviral DNA in these cloned cells was significantly low. Our results indicate that the ability of cell proliferation in HAM patients is not restricted in HTLV-I-infected T cells.

Expression of sCD27 inhibits CD27-dependent T-cell or CLL-cell activation mediated by its ligand, CD70. In this study, we evaluated whether protease inhibitors could inhibit the release of sCD27 from CLL cells and enhance T-cell activation mediated by CD27-CD70 interaction. METHODS: CLL cells exposed to hydroxamic acid-based matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitors were evaluated for the release of sCD27 by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation. We examined for phenotypic changes in CLL cells treated with MMP inhibitors by flow cytometry and T-cell activation by CLL cells was assessed by [(3)H] thymidine incorporation assay and the production of interferon-gamma. RESULTS: Treatment of CLL cells with MMP inhibitors blocked the release of sCD27 to the culture supernatant. In contrast, a non-hydroxamic acid control compound or inhibitors of other proteases, including serine, cysteine, and aspartyl proteases, were ineffective. Furthermore, CLL cells treated with MMP inhibitors expressed significantly higher levels of accessory molecules, such as CD54, CD80, and CD95. Consistent with such changes, we found that CLL cells treated with MMP inhibitors, but not control treated cells, could stimulate allogeneic and autologous T cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. CONCLUSION: These data reveal that metalloprotease inhibitors can block production of sCD27, which can interfere with mCD27-CD70 interactions that induce expression of immune costimulatory molecules on CLL B cells. Conceivably, treatment of CLL cells with metalloprotease inhibitors may enhance their potential for stimulating cellular immune recognition of leukemia-associated antigens.","['Kato, Kazunori', 'Chu, Peter', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Hamada, Hirofumi', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Kato K', 'Chu P', 'Takahashi S', 'Hamada H', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA. kakazu@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (KB R8301)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'BK349F52C9 (batimastat)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)']",IM,"['CD27 Ligand/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Metalloproteases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/immunology']",2007/02/21 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00701-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Mar;35(3):434-42. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the role of Ink4b in hematopoiesis remains unclear. Here we examined the role of Ink4b in blood cell formation using Ink4b-deficient (Ink4b(-/-)) mice. METHODS: We compared the bone marrow (BM) of Ink4b(-/-) and wild-type mice using flow cytometric, colony-forming unit and competitive repopulating assays (CRA). The proliferation, differentiation, self-renewal, and apoptosis of progenitor cells were further compared by in vitro and in vivo methods. RESULTS: BM from Ink4b(-/-) mice contained increased numbers of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors and Gr-1(+) cells and showed a competitive advantage over wild-type cells in myeloid cell formation by CRA. Ink4b(-/-) progenitors did not demonstrate increased proliferation, self-renewing potential, or reduced apoptosis. Instead, Ink4b(-/-) common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) showed increased myeloid progenitor formation concomitant with reduced erythroid potential. CONCLUSIONS: This work establishes a role for Ink4b in regulating the differentiation of CMPs and indicates that loss of Ink4b enhances the formation of myeloid progenitors.","['Rosu-Myles, Michael', 'Taylor, Barbara J', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Rosu-Myles M', 'Taylor BJ', 'Wolff L']","['Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-4263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/methods', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*deficiency/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/physiology']",2007/02/21 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00699-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Mar;35(3):394-406. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.11.005.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of IM has been associated with cutaneous reactions. In the last 2 years numerous studies have focused the attention on hypopigmentations, depigmentations and photosensitivity developing after the initiation of IM therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of IM therapy on the skin pigmentation of five patients affected by CML. METHODS: Skin pigmentation measurements were performed with a Minolta CR-200 Chromameter. results: All the studied patients show the gradual lightening of the skin on unexposed areas over the treatment with IM. In particular, this explorative colorimetric study indicates the association between IM and skin depigmentation with a significant increase of luminance value (L*) (P = 0.001) and a significant decrease of the pigmentation value (b*) (P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Even if we do not know the clinical significance of the skin depigmentation caused by IM, the regulatory role of KIT and its ligand stem cell factor in melanocyte development and survival seems to suggest an objective mechanism of action for IM in the pathogenesis of this cutaneous depigmentation.","['Brazzelli, V', 'Prestinari, F', 'Barbagallo, T', 'Rona, C', 'Orlandi, E', 'Passamonti, F', 'Locatelli, F', 'Zecca, M', 'Villani, S', 'Borroni, G']","['Brazzelli V', 'Prestinari F', 'Barbagallo T', 'Rona C', 'Orlandi E', 'Passamonti F', 'Locatelli F', 'Zecca M', 'Villani S', 'Borroni G']","['Department of Human and Hereditary Pathology, Institute of Dermatology, University of Pavia, IRCCS-Policlinico S.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of simultaneous presentation of both lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative diseases, and rheumatic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study included were all patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (1920 patients) followed at our hospital during the last 5 years. 312/1920 (16.2%) patients presented with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 645/1920 (33.5%) had myeloma, 558/1920 (29%) had leukemia and miscellaneous other hematological malignancies (Hodgkin's lymphoma, cryoglogulinaemia etc) had 405/1920 patients (21%). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), ribosome P and intermediate filament antibodies (IMF) were measured by immunofluorescence (IF). Anti-double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibodies and extractable nuclear antigens (ENA: Sm, RNP, SSA, SSB, Scl70) were measured by ELISA and the rheumatoid factor (RF) by nephelometry. RESULTS: 388/1920 (4.6%) patients were ANA positive (antibody titres>1/160). On the other hand, clinical symptoms attributed autoimmune diseases (arthralgias, morning stiffness etc) plus autoantibodies other than ANA were present only in 8/312 (2.56%) patients with NHL, among them one with anti-cardiolipin antibodies. It is interesting that from these 8 patients, 3 had MALT lymphoma and 3 diffuse B-cell large cell lymphoma. Also, we detected anti-IMF and IgM and lgG anti-CMV antibodies in 2/312 (0.42%) patients with NHL. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the simultaneous presence of lymphoproliferative diseases and rheumatic syndromes are more frequent among lymphoma patients than in other lymphoproliferative diseases. Therefore, the screening of antibodies in NHL patients may be useful for the discovery and the treatment of an underlying autoimmune disease.","['Chloraki-Bobota, A', 'Megalakaki, C', 'Repousis, P', 'Chalkiopoulou, Ir', 'Lalaki, I', 'Trafalis, D T', 'Athanassiou, A E', 'Mitsouli-Mentzikof, Chr']","['Chloraki-Bobota A', 'Megalakaki C', 'Repousis P', 'Chalkiopoulou I', 'Lalaki I', 'Trafalis DT', 'Athanassiou AE', 'Mitsouli-Mentzikof C']","['Departments of Immunology, Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece. dpsd00045@syros.aegean.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/*blood', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'DNA/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Syndrome']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2006 Oct-Dec;11(4):485-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPT is a drug which inhibits the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I (topo I), thereby leading to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. On the other hand, octreotide (OCT) is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, which can induce apoptosis and antiproliferative effects on various human tumor cell lines, human xenografts and animal tumors, as well as on lymphoproliferative neoplasms. Hereby, we studied the effects of TPT and OCT, and their combination in the treatment of the rodent P388 lymphocytic leukemia, in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cultures of P388 lymphocytic leukemia cells, as well as BDF1 male and female mice implanted with the P388 leukemia cells, were used for the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antineoplastic activity of OCT and TPT. RESULTS: A significant increase of antileukemic activity of the combined treatment with both TPT and OCT was demonstrated. These results suggest that OCT enhances the effectiveness of TPT in the treatment of leukemia. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the combination of OCT with TPT in the treatment of hematological neoplasias is effective, and represents an interesting addition to the future therapeutic options, because os its mechanism of action and its toxicity profile.","['Dalezis, P', 'Geromichalos, G D', 'Voyatzi, S', 'Trafalis, D', 'Athanassiou, A E', 'Koutsilieris, M', 'Papageorgiou, A']","['Dalezis P', 'Geromichalos GD', 'Voyatzi S', 'Trafalis D', 'Athanassiou AE', 'Koutsilieris M', 'Papageorgiou A']","['Laboratory of Cell Culture - Molecular Modeling & Drug Design, Symeonidio Research Center, Theagenio Cancer Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Octreotide/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topotecan/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2006 Jul-Sep;11(3):323-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this study is an effort to develop new anticancer drugs and procedures with enhanced antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. This study was designed to determine the antileukemic and cytogenetic activity of five mixtures of three specific steroidal esters of aromatic nitrogen mustards in different proportions. This is the next step of two previous studies where the combination of two such esteric analogues was investigated with promising results. All of the five mixtures used proved active against leukemia P388 and in the induction of sister chromatid exchanges, indicating that the combination of the same class of compounds can be successful, especially when a highly potent agent is combined with another less active but probably mechanistically supplementary one. These results can be used in future experiments in order to further scout the specific role of the steroidal part of these molecules in the antileukemic potency of them.","['Fousteris, M A', 'Papageorgiou, A', 'Arsenou, E S', 'Koutsourea, A I', 'Karaberis, E', 'Mourelatos, D', 'Onyango, D O', 'Nikolaropoulos, S S']","['Fousteris MA', 'Papageorgiou A', 'Arsenou ES', 'Koutsourea AI', 'Karaberis E', 'Mourelatos D', 'Onyango DO', 'Nikolaropoulos SS']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Rion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Androstanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azasteroids)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '146678-52-6', '(3-hydroxy-N-methyl-17-aza-D-homoandrostan-17-one-4-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoph', 'enylacetate)']",IM,"['Androstanes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azasteroids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2004/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['000099983 [pii]', '10.1159/000099983 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2007;53(2):118-26. doi: 10.1159/000099983.

We aimed at generating leukemia-reactive donor T cells for patients with AML. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the donor were stimulated with mature donor dendritic cells, pulsed with irradiated patient leukemic blasts (LB), or directly with cytokine-treated LB. After 3 weekly stimulations, donor cells were tested for anti-leukemic reactivity in an IFNgamma Elispot. RESULTS: In 5 of 6 donors, cells with reactivity against patient LB with low or absent reactivity against non-leukemic cells could be generated. T cell subset analyses in 2 donors indicated that specific anti-leukemic reactivity was mainly mediated by CD4+ T cells, which were also the predominant cell fraction in 4 of 6 donors. One leukemia-reactive donor T cell line was expanded with a recently developed system. One week of expansion resulted in a 10-fold increase in reactivity with sustained specificity of the resulting T cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the feasibility of the in vitro generation of leukemia-reactive donor lymphocytes, rendering this method a promising tool for post-HSCT immunotherapy.","['Thomas-Kaskel, Anna-Katharina', 'Portugal, Tatiana Gil Alves', 'Herchenbach, Dieter', 'Houet, Leonora', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Thomas-Kaskel AK', 'Portugal TG', 'Herchenbach D', 'Houet L', 'Veelken H', 'Finke J']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. kaskel@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*transplantation', 'Female', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['000099547 [pii]', '10.1159/000099547 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2007;117(4):226-35. doi: 10.1159/000099547.

TLR7, expressed by B cells and some dendritic cells, recognizes molecular patterns associated with viruses that can be mimicked by synthetic imidazoquinolines. In response to primary stimulation with the imidazoquinoline, S28690, human mononuclear cells produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but were unable to do so upon restimulation with S28690. This state of ""tolerization"" lasted at least 5 days. Using chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells as a model to facilitate biochemical analysis, the tolerized state was found to be associated with altered receptor components, including down-regulated expression of TLR7 mRNA and decreased levels of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1. Tolerization was characterized by a transcriptionally regulated block in stress-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappaB activation, with relatively preserved activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Tolerized chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were found to be more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, in part through altered stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. This property of the TLR7-tolerized state may potentially be exploited in the treatment of B cell cancers.","['Shi, Yonghong', 'White, Dionne', 'He, Liwei', 'Miller, Richard L', 'Spaner, David E']","['Shi Y', 'White D', 'He L', 'Miller RL', 'Spaner DE']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (S 28690)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/agonists/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/4/1823 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2381 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 15;67(4):1823-31. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, c-Jun was the most up-regulated gene even at the earliest point of analysis (2 h). We also observed adaphostin-induced c-Abl cleavage in immunoblot analysis. Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, but not melphalan or dexamethasone, induced similar effects, indicating unique agent-dependent mechanisms. Using caspase inhibitors, as well as caspase-resistant mutants of c-Abl (TM-c-Abl and D565A-Abl), we then showed that c-Abl cleavage in MM cells requires caspase activity. Importantly, both overexpression of the c-Abl fragment or c-Jun and knockdown of c-Abl and c-Jun expression by small interfering RNA confirmed that adaphostin-induced c-Jun up-regulation triggers downstream caspase-mediated c-Abl cleavage, inhibition of MM cell growth, and induction of apoptosis.

Leukemic gene dysregulation by t(5;14) was investigated by DNA inhibitory treatments with 26-mer double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides directed against candidate enhancers at, or near, orphan T-cell DNase I hypersensitive sites located between 3'-BCL11B and VRK1. NKX2-5 down-regulation in t(5;14) PEER cells was almost entirely restricted to DNA inhibitory treatment targeting enhancers within the distal breakpoint cluster region and was dose and sequence dependent, whereas enhancers near 3'-BCL11B regulated that gene only. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the four most effectual NKX2-5 ectopic enhancers were hyperacetylated. These enhancers clustered approximately 1 Mbp downstream of BCL11B, within a region displaying multiple regulatory stigmata, including a TCRA enhancer motif, deep sequence conservation, and tight nuclear matrix attachment relaxed by trichostatin A treatment. Intriguingly, although TLX3/NKX2-5 promoter/exon 1 regions were hypoacetylated, their expression was trichostatin A sensitive, implying extrinsic regulation by factor(s) under acetylation control. Knockdown of PU.1, known to be trichostatin A responsive and which potentially binds TLX3/NKX2-5 promoters, effected down-regulation of both homeobox genes. Moreover, genomic analysis showed preferential enrichment near ectopic enhancers of binding sites for the PU.1 cofactor HMGA1, the knockdown of which also inhibited NKX2-5. We suggest that HMGA1 and PU.1 coregulate ectopic homeobox gene expression in t(5;14) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by interactions mediated at the nuclear matrix.

The T helper type 1 cytokine interleukin (IL)-18 has been shown to induce the maturation of these cells towards a dendritic phenotype and, moreover, is able to mediate IFNgamma production in this model. Because T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) is considered to be of paramount importance for dendritic cell function, the effects of IL-18 on this transcription factor have been investigated in the current study. Here, we show that activation of KG-1 cells by IL-18 induces T-bet mRNA and protein within 4 to 6 h of incubation. This hitherto unrecognized function of IL-18 was suppressed by the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and nuclear factor-kappaB function. Blockage of translation by cycloheximide, usage of neutralizing antibodies, and the inability of IFNgamma to mediate significant p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in KG-1 cells clearly revealed that activation of T-bet was not via autocrine IFNgamma. T-bet function was evaluated by short interfering RNA technology. Notably, specific suppression of T-bet induction impaired secretion of IFNgamma by KG-1 cells under the influence of IL-18. Therapeutic application of IL-18 has the potential to profoundly affect the biology of acute myeloid leukemia predendritic cells such as KG-1 cells. Under these conditions, activation of T-bet may play a key role in processes that have the potential to correct the T helper type 1 deficiency associated with leukemia-mediated immunosuppression.","['Bachmann, Malte', 'Dragoi, Cristina', 'Poleganov, Marco A', 'Pfeilschifter, Josef', 'Muhl, Heiko']","['Bachmann M', 'Dragoi C', 'Poleganov MA', 'Pfeilschifter J', 'Muhl H']","['Pharmazentrum Frankfurt, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Th1 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/723 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0505 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):723-31. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined exposure of U937 leukemia cells to marginally toxic concentrations of vorinostat and flavopiridol resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis accompanied by pronounced reductions in XIAP and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP expression by vorinostat/flavopiridol was associated with enhanced inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and was amplified by caspase-mediated protein degradation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that XIAP and Mcl-1 down-regulation were also accompanied by both decreased association of nuclear factor-kappaB (XIAP) and increased E2F1 association (Mcl-1) with their promoter regions, respectively. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 but not XIAP partially protected cells from flavopiridol/vorinostat-mediated mitochondrial injury at 48 h, but both did not significantly restored clonogenic potential. Flavopiridol/vorinostat-mediated transcriptional repression of XIAP, Mcl-1-enhanced apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic potential also occurred in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. Together, these findings indicate that transcriptional repression of XIAP and Mcl-1 by flavopiridol/vorinostat contributes functionally to apoptosis induction at early exposure intervals and raise the possibility that expression levels may be a useful surrogate marker for activity in current trials.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Kolla, Sarah S', 'Maggio, Sonia C', 'Coe, Stefanie', 'Gimenez, Maria S', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Kolla SS', 'Maggio SC', 'Coe S', 'Gimenez MS', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia Campus, MCV Station Box 980035, Richmond, VA 23298. stgrant@hsc.vcu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Vorinostat', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/692 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0562 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):692-702. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0562.,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas gallium is known to target cellular iron homeostasis, the basis for lymphoma cell resistance to gallium is not known. Understanding mechanisms of resistance may suggest strategies to enhance the clinical efficacy of gallium. In the present study, we used a focused DNA microarray to compare the expression of genes related to metal metabolism in gallium-resistant and gallium-sensitive lymphoma cell lines developed by us. Gallium-resistant cells were found to display a marked increase in gene expression for metallothionein-2A and the zinc transporter ZnT-1. Cells exposed to gallium nitrate displayed an increase in the binding of metal-responsive transcription factor-1 to metal response element sequences involved in the transcriptional regulation of metallothionein and ZnT-1 genes. Gallium nitrate induced metallothionein-2A and ZnT-1 expression in cells. A role for metallothionein in modulating the antineoplastic activity of gallium was confirmed by showing that the induction of metallothionein expression by zinc provided partial protection against the cytotoxicity of gallium and by showing that the level of endogenous metallothionein in lymphoma cell lines correlated with their sensitivity to gallium nitrate. Immunohistochemical staining of lymphomatous tissues revealed metallothionein protein to be variably expressed in different lymphomas. Our studies show for the first time that gallium acts on pathways related to zinc metabolism and that metal-responsive transcription factor-1 activity and metallothionein expression contribute to the development of gallium drug resistance. Furthermore, the endogenous level of metallothionein in lymphoma may be an important determinant of clinical response to gallium nitrate.","['Yang, Meiying', 'Kroft, Steven H', 'Chitambar, Christopher R']","['Yang M', 'Kroft SH', 'Chitambar CR']","['Division of Neoplastic Diseases, Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (SLC30A1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcription factor MTF-1)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Metallothionein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/633 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0557 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):633-43. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0557.,"['R01 CA109518-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 109518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of specific small-molecule inhibitors has been a tremendous step in the fight against cancer and their main targets are the cellular counterparts of viral oncogenes. The best-known example of a molecular therapeutic is Gleevec (imatinib). In the early 1990s, IFN-alpha treatment produced a sustained cytologic response in approximately 33% of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Today, with Gleevec targeting the kinase activity of the proto-oncogene abl, the hematologic response rate in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients is 95% with 89% progression-free survival at 18 months. There are still drawbacks to the new therapies, such as drug resistance after a period of treatment, but the drawbacks are being studied experimentally. New drugs and combination therapies are being designed that will bypass the resistance mechanisms.","['Diehl, Kathleen M', 'Keller, Evan T', 'Ignatoski, Kathleen M Woods']","['Diehl KM', 'Keller ET', 'Ignatoski KM']","['Department of Urology, University of Michigan, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0940, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/418 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0603 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):418-27. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0603.,['R01 CA 098513/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether uterine receptivity for blastocyst implantation can be further extended on day 6 of PSP and the role of progesterone (P(4)) on this event. Embryo transfers, experimentally induced decidualization, in situ hybridization and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation were performed. Blastocysts initiate attachment reaction within 48 h when transferred on day 5, but not on day 6 of PSP. Likewise, decidualization reaction occurred on days 4 and 5 of PSP, but completely failed on day 6. However, P(4) supplementation partially retains uterine receptivity for blastocyst implantation and decidualization on day 6 of PSP. In addition, certain indicators of uterine receptivity, such as cell proliferation profile and expression patterns of implantation-related genes were similarly observed on days 4 and 5 of PSP, but not on day 6. Consistent with embryo transfer and decidualization, exogenous administration of P(4) partially restores these indicators on day 6 of PSP.

We used quantitative AS microarray profiling to survey changes in AS during activation of Jurkat cells, a leukemia-derived T-cell line. Our results indicate that approximately 10-15% of the profiled alternative exons undergo a >10% change in inclusion level during activation. The majority of the genes displaying differential AS levels are distinct from the set of genes displaying differential transcript levels. These two gene sets also have overlapping yet distinct functional roles. For example, genes that show differential AS patterns during T-cell activation are often closely associated with cell-cycle regulation, whereas genes with differential transcript levels are highly enriched in functions associated more directly with immune defense and cytoskeletal architecture. Previously unknown AS events were detected in genes that have important roles in T-cell activation, and these AS level changes were also observed during the activation of normal human peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. In summary, by using AS microarray profiling, we have discovered many new AS changes associated with T-cell activation.

The development of standardized criteria for FDG-PET imaging and establishment of procedures for transmission, storage, quality assurance, and analysis of PET images afforded by this demonstration project could streamline clinical trials of new treatments for more intractable forms of lymphoma and other cancers and, hence, accelerate new drug approvals.","['Kelloff, Gary J', 'Sullivan, Daniel M', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Cheson, Bruce', 'Juweid, Malik', 'Mills, George Q', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Horning, Sandra J', 'Weber, Wolfgang', 'Sargent, Daniel J', 'Dodd, Lori', 'Korn, Edward', 'Armitage, James', 'Schilsky, Richard', 'Christian, Michaele', ""O'connor, Owen A"", 'Wang, Sue Jane', 'Farrell, Ann T', 'Pazdur, Richard', 'Graham, Michael', 'Wahl, Richard L', 'Larson, Steven M', 'Kostakoglu, Lale', 'Daube-Witherspoon, Margaret', 'Gastonis, Constantine', 'Siegel, Barry A', 'Shankar, Lalitha K', 'Lee, David B', 'Higley, Howard R', 'Sigman, Caroline C', 'Carucci, Daniel', 'Timko, David', 'deGennaro, Louis J', 'Sigal, Ellen', 'Barker, Anna', 'Woodcock, Janet']","['Kelloff GJ', 'Sullivan DM', 'Wilson W', 'Cheson B', 'Juweid M', 'Mills GQ', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Horning SJ', 'Weber W', 'Sargent DJ', 'Dodd L', 'Korn E', 'Armitage J', 'Schilsky R', 'Christian M', ""O'connor OA"", 'Wang SJ', 'Farrell AT', 'Pazdur R', 'Graham M', 'Wahl RL', 'Larson SM', 'Kostakoglu L', 'Daube-Witherspoon M', 'Gastonis C', 'Siegel BA', 'Shankar LK', 'Lee DB', 'Higley HR', 'Sigman CC', 'Carucci D', 'Timko D', 'deGennaro LJ', 'Sigal E', 'Barker A', 'Woodcock J']","['National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD)/Cancer Imaging Program, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acad Radiol,Academic radiology,9440159,['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)'],IM,"['Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/02/20 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1076-6332(06)00718-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.acra.2006.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Acad Radiol. 2007 Mar;14(3):330-9. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2006.12.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is however limited by the difficulty of generating sufficient amounts of CTLs in vitro, especially for the treatment of solid tumors. Recent gene therapy approaches, including two clinical trials, successfully apply genetic engineering of T cell specificity by T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer. In this review we want to elucidate several principles of the redirection of T cell specificity. We cover basic aspects of retroviral gene transfer, regarding transduction efficacy and transgene expression levels. It was demonstrated that the number of TCR molecules on a T cell is important for its function. Therefore, an efficient transfer system that yields high transduction efficiency and strong and stable transgene expression is a prerequisite to achieve effector function by redirected T cells. Furthermore, we consider more recent aspects of T cell specificity engineering. These include the possibility of co-transferring coreceptors to create for example functional T helper cells by engrafting CD4(+) T cells with a MHC class I restricted TCR and the CD8 coreceptor and vice versa. Also, risks related to the adoptive transfer of TCR gene-modified T cells and possible safety mechanisms are discussed. Finally, we summarize recent findings describing transferred TCRs capable of displacing endogenous TCRs from the cell surface.","['Engels, Boris', 'Uckert, Wolfgang']","['Engels B', 'Uckert W']","['Humboldt-University Berlin, Institute of Biology, Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Gene Therapy, Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10, D-13092 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Mol Aspects Med,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods/*trends', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*trends', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/administration & dosage/*genetics/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0098-2997(07)00008-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mam.2006.12.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Aspects Med. 2007 Feb;28(1):115-42. doi: 10.1016/j.mam.2006.12.006.

We first used molecular modelling to predict that the gp30 minimal fusion peptide corresponds to the 15 first residues. Liposome lipid-mixing and leakage assays confirmed that the 15-residue long peptide induces fusion in vitro and that it is the shortest peptide inducing optimal fusion since longer peptides destabilize liposomes to the same extent but not shorter ones. The 15-residue long peptide can thus be considered as the minimal fusion peptide. The effect of mutations reported in the literature was also investigated. Interestingly, mutations related to glycoproteins unable to induce syncytia in cell-cell fusion assays correspond to peptides predicted as non-tilted. The relationship between obliquity and fusogenicity was also confirmed in vitro for one tilted and one non-tilted mutant peptide.","['Lorin, Aurelien', 'Lins, Laurence', 'Stroobant, Vincent', 'Brasseur, Robert', 'Charloteaux, Benoit']","['Lorin A', 'Lins L', 'Stroobant V', 'Brasseur R', 'Charloteaux B']","['Centre de Biophysique Moleculaire Numerique, Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, 2 Passage des deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (gp30 envelope transmembrane protein, Bovine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Fusion', 'Computational Biology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*chemistry/genetics']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)00258-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Apr 13;355(3):649-53. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.182.

Its active ingredient, imatinib ([4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidinyl] amino]phenyl]benzamide), blocks the activity of several tyrosine kinases. Here we labeled imatinib with carbon-11 as a tool for determining the drug distribution and pharmacokinetics of imatinib, and we carried out positron emission tomography (PET) studies in baboons. METHODS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib was synthesized from [(11)C]methyl iodide and norimatinib was synthesized by the demethylation of imatinib (isolated from Gleevec tablets) according to a patent procedure [Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Anderson LW. Imaging of drug accumulation as a guide to antitumor therapy. US Patent 20030198594A1, 2003]. Norimatinib was also synthesized from the corresponding amine and acid. PET studies were carried out in three baboons to measure pharmacokinetics in the brain and peripheral organs and to determine the effect of a therapeutic dose of imatinib. Log D and plasma protein binding were also measured. RESULTS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib uptake in the brain is negligible (consistent with P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux); it peaks and clears rapidly from the heart, lungs and spleen. Peak uptake and clearance occur more slowly in the liver and kidneys, followed by accumulation in the gallbladder and urinary bladder. Pretreatment with imatinib did not change uptake in the heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen, and increased uptake in the liver and gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib has potential for assessing the regional distribution and kinetics of imatinib in the human body to determine whether the drug targets tumors and to identify other organs to which the drug or its labeled metabolites distribute. Paired with tracers such as 2'deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)FDG) and 3'deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)FLT), [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib may be a useful radiotracer for planning chemotherapy, for monitoring response to treatment and for assessing the role of drug pharmacokinetics in drug resistance.","['Kil, Kun-Eek', 'Ding, Yu-Shin', 'Lin, Kuo-Shyan', 'Alexoff, David', 'Kim, Sung Won', 'Shea, Colleen', 'Xu, Youwen', 'Muench, Lisa', 'Fowler, Joanna S']","['Kil KE', 'Ding YS', 'Lin KS', 'Alexoff D', 'Kim SW', 'Shea C', 'Xu Y', 'Muench L', 'Fowler JS']","['Medical Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Nucl Med Biol,Nuclear medicine and biology,9304420,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Carbon Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Organ Specificity', 'Papio anubis', 'Piperazines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole Body Imaging']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-8051(06)00236-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2006.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Biol. 2007 Feb;34(2):153-63. doi: 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2006.11.004.,"['K05 DA020001/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 DA020001-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'K05DA020001/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2866181,['NIHMS170475'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NPM1 mutations are characterised by four basepair insertions within the region corresponding to the C-terminus of the protein leading to its translocation out of the nucleus. Until now, more than 40 different subsets of mutations have been identified and about 90% of NPM1 mutations are represented by subtype A and B (78% versus 12%, respectively). So far, standard screening of NPM1 mutations using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by capillary electrophoresis is rather time consuming. We established a new method for rapid screening of NPM1 mutations using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle. Furthermore, based on individual NPM1 mutations type A and B, we designed mutation specific primers to perform a highly sensitive PCR assay that can be applied for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD).

The data on long-term outcome of APL in children are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical biological features, diagnosis, prognosis and long-term survival of childhood APL. METHODS: A total of 46 children with newly diagnosed APL from April 1998 to October 2005 were enrolled into this study. Induction treatment containing all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus daunorubicin (DNR) or pirarubicin (THP) was performed on these patients, followed by 6 courses of chemotherapy consolidation: DNR, homoharringtonine or etoposide plus Ara-C. A maintenance therapy was then administered once 3-6 months. The total period of treatment was 2.5 years. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients who had completed the regular treatment, 36 (92.3%) achieved a complete remission. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 28.6%. The estimated overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were (86.1 +/- 5.8)%, (76.1 +/- 7.5)% and (70.2 +/- 8.9)% respectively, while the event free survival (EFS) rates were (78.4 +/- 6.8)%, (63.6 +/- 8.7)% and (53.1 +/- 10.0)% respectively. The 5-year OS rate of patients with WBC less than or equal to 10.0 X 10(9)/L was (81.4 +/- 10.3)%, which was significantly higher than that with WBC greater than 10.0 X 10(9)/L[(51.6 +/- 14.7)%, P < 0.05]. Five patients with RT-PCR positive for PML/RARalpha S (short) subtype died eventually although all of them achieved CR, but none of the 13 patients with PML/RARalpha L (long) subtype died. CONCLUSIONS: Remission induction therapy with ATRA + DNR or THP is effective and safe for newly diagnosed childhood APL. The remission induction therapy combined with chemotherapy containing high/intermediate dose Ara-C can improve the long-term survival rates of APL patients. High WBC count and S subtype of PML-RARa are two poor prognostic factors for children with APL.","['Xu, Xiao-Jun', 'Shi, Shu-Wen', 'Tang, Yong-Min', 'Song, Hua', 'Yang, Shi-Long', 'Wei, Jian', 'Xu, Wei-Qun', 'Pan, Bin-Hua', 'Chen, Ying-Hu', 'Zhao, Fen-Ying', 'Shen, Hong-Qiang', 'Qian, Bai-Qin', 'Zhang, Ling-Yan', 'Ning, Bo-Tao']","['Xu XJ', 'Shi SW', 'Tang YM', 'Song H', 'Yang SL', 'Wei J', 'Xu WQ', 'Pan BH', 'Chen YH', 'Zhao FY', 'Shen HQ', 'Qian BQ', 'Zhang LY', 'Ning BT']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2007)01-0028-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Feb;9(1):28-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of a novel isoform of HBZ, termed HBZ-SP1, has recently been characterized in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells and has been found to be associated with intense nuclear spots. In this study, we investigated the role of these nuclear bodies in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of JunB. RESULTS: Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that the HBZ-SP1 protein localizes to intense dots corresponding to HBZ-NBs and to nucleoli. We analyzed the relative mobility of the EGFP-HBZ-SP1 fusion protein using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis and found that the deletion of the ZIP domain perturbs the association of the HBZ-SP1 protein to the HBZ-NBs. These data suggested that HBZ needs cellular partners, including bZIP factors, to form HBZ-NBs. Indeed, by cotransfection experiments in COS cells, we have found that the bZIP factor JunB is able to target delocalized form of HBZ (deleted in its nuclear localization subdomains) into the HBZ-NBs. We also show that the viral protein is able to entail a redistribution of JunB into the HBZ-NBs. Moreover, by transfecting HeLa cells (known to express high level of JunB) with a vector expressing HBZ-SP1, the sequestration of JunB to the HBZ-NBs inhibited its transcriptional activity. Lastly, we analyzed the nuclear distribution of HBZ-SP1 in the presence of JunD, a Jun family member known to be activated by HBZ. In this case, no NBs were detected and the HBZ-SP1 protein was diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HBZ-mediated sequestration of JunB to the HBZ-NBs may be causing the repression of JunB activity in vivo.","['Hivin, Patrick', 'Basbous, Jihane', 'Raymond, Frederic', 'Henaff, Daniel', 'Arpin-Andre, Charlotte', 'Robert-Hebmann, Veronique', 'Barbeau, Benoit', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel']","['Hivin P', 'Basbous J', 'Raymond F', 'Henaff D', 'Arpin-Andre C', 'Robert-Hebmann V', 'Barbeau B', 'Mesnard JM']","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CNRS/UM I UMR 5121/IFR 122, Institut de Biologie, 34000 Montpellier, France. patrick.hivin@univ-montp1.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Isoforms/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-4-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-14 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Feb 16;4:14. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-14.,,PMC1805765,,,,20070216,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted inhibitors of Bcr-Abl have antiproliferative effects on the leukemic cells and induce apoptosis, favouring a regression of the CML chronic phase, but in the successive blast crisis phase cancer cells frequently develop resistance to Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Src is a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, fundamental for cell development, growth, replication, adhesion, motility and is overexpressed in a wide number of human cancers. Recently it was demonstrated that Src is increased in hematopoietic cells expressing Bcr-Abl and is involved in the oncogenic pathway that causes CML.

While this has been accepted for solid forms of cancer there is now emerging evidence that progression of hematological malignancies also requires the induction of new blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be an essential regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have validated VEGF as target for antiangiogenesis and anticancer therapy. With regard to hematological malignancies a stimulating effect of VEGF for proliferation, survival and migration of leukemia cells could be demonstrated. Bone marrow of leukemia patients shows an increased microvessel density as well as VEGF expression. Complete remissions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been reported by targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase system of VEGF. While the pathophysiology behind the contribution of VEGF to leukemia progression is not yet completely understood, VEGF and its receptors may provide promising targets not only in solid tumors but also hematological malignancies such as AML.","['Kessler, Torsten', 'Fehrmann, Frauke', 'Bieker, Ralf', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mesters, Rolf M']","['Kessler T', 'Fehrmann F', 'Bieker R', 'Berdel WE', 'Mesters RM']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology and Oncology, and the IZKF Muenster, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, D-48129 Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*drug effects/physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*drug effects/physiology']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138945007779940089 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2007 Feb;8(2):257-68. doi: 10.2174/138945007779940089.,,,,,,,226,,,,,,,,,,,

It is increasingly recognized that AML represents a hierarchical disease, originating from a leukemia stem cell population. Sophisticated animal models have helped to elucidate rate-limiting steps in initiation, development and maintenance of AML. This review discusses the fundamental genetic events identified to date that determine the pathogenesis of AML, with particular emphasis on the oncogenic signaling events that result from translocation of myeloid transcription factors and mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases.

The most commonly involved genes are the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 or c-KIT and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases JAK2 and ABL. Activation occurs as a consequence of specific point mutations or fusion genes generated by chromosomal translocations, insertions or deletions. Mutant kinases are constitutively active in the absence of the natural ligands resulting in deregulation of haemopoiesis in a manner analogous to BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia. With the advent of targeted signal transduction therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, an accurate diagnosis of CMPDs by morphology, karyotyping and molecular genetics has become increasingly important. Imatinib induces high response rates in patients associated with constitutive activation of ABL, PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and some KIT mutants.

CpGs 3' of the TSS of actively transcribed CpG island promoters typically remain methylation-free, indicating that maintaining promoter-proximal CpGs in an unmethylated state may be important for efficient transcription. Here we utilize recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to introduce a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMuLV)-based reporter, in vitro methylated 1 kb downstream of the TSS, into a defined genomic site. In a subset of clones, methylation spreads to within approximately 320 bp of the TSS, yielding a dramatic decrease in transcript level, even though the promoter/TSS region remains unmethylated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that such promoter-proximal methylation results in loss of RNA polymerase II and TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) binding in the promoter region, suggesting that repression occurs at the level of transcription initiation. While DNA methylation-dependent trimethylation of H3 lysine (K)9 is confined to the intragenic methylated region, the promoter and downstream regions are hypo-acetylated on H3K9/K14. Furthermore, DNase I hypersensitivity and methylase-based single promoter analysis (M-SPA) experiments reveal that a nucleosome is positioned over the unmethylated TATA-box in these clones, indicating that dense DNA methylation downstream of the promoter region is sufficient to alter the chromatin structure of an unmethylated promoter. Based on these observations, we propose that a DNA methylation-free region extending several hundred bases downstream of the TSS may be a prerequisite for efficient transcription initiation. This model provides a biochemical explanation for the typical positioning of TSSs well upstream of the 3' end of the CpG islands in which they are embedded.","['Appanah, Ruth', 'Dickerson, David R', 'Goyal, Preeti', 'Groudine, Mark', 'Lorincz, Matthew C']","['Appanah R', 'Dickerson DR', 'Goyal P', 'Groudine M', 'Lorincz MC']","['Department of Medical Genetics, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transgenes']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['06-PLGE-RA-0373R3 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0030027 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2007 Feb 16;3(2):e27. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030027.

Angiotensin II stimulates the proliferation of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood hematopoietic progenitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) hyperfunction may lead to the acceleration of negative hematopoietic regulator peptide, AcSDKP, metabolism, which in turn lowers its level in the bone marrow microenvironment, finally removing the antiproliferative effect of AcSDKP on the hematopoietic cells and blasts. The aim of this study is therefore to search those major RAS components simultaneously in the leukemic blast cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Bone marrow aspiration materials were obtained from 10 patients with AML (8 males, 2 females; median age 48.5 years) and 8 patients with nonmalignant hematological disorders (6 males, 2 females; median age 45 years). EDTA-treated bone marrow samples were stored at -70 degrees C until analysis. Total RNA was extracted from 200-microl bone marrow samples by High Pure RNA Isolation Kit. RESULTS: The medians of expression ratios of AML patient samples have been found 0.736 (IQR 1.359), 0.540 (IQR 0.725), and 0.075 (IQR 0.002) for ACE, ANG and REN genes, respectively. All three gene expressions were found to be significantly higher in the bone marrow samples of AML patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the expression of the mRNAs of the major RAS components-namely ACE, renin and angiotensinogen-in human bone marrow samples were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm the presence of the local bone marrow RAS. Elucidation of the pathological activity of the local RAS-mediated regulation of the leukemogenesis is both pathobiologically and clinically important, since the angiotensin peptides represent a molecular target in the disease management.","['Beyazit, Yavuz', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Kekilli, Murat', 'Misirlioglu, Muge', 'Tuncer, Serdar', 'Karakaya, Jale', 'Koca, Ebru', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Goker, Hakan']","['Beyazit Y', 'Aksu S', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Kekilli M', 'Misirlioglu M', 'Tuncer S', 'Karakaya J', 'Koca E', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Sayinalp N', 'Goker H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. yavuzbeyaz@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Med Assoc,Journal of the National Medical Association,7503090,"['0 (Angiotensins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Angiotensins/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Oligopeptides/analysis', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/genetics', 'Renin/genetics', 'Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology']",2007/02/20 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Med Assoc. 2007 Jan;99(1):57-63.,,PMC2569610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMN107 is a new higher-potency inhibitor of BCR-ABL. To identify mutations in BCR-ABL that could result in resistance to AMN107, a cDNA library of BCR-ABL mutants was introduced into Ba/F3 cells followed by selection in AMN107 (0.125-0.5 microM). A total of 86 individual, drug-resistant colonies were recovered, and the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains of BCR-ABL were sequenced. A total of 46 colonies had single point mutations in BCR-ABL, with a total of 17 different mutations, all within the kinase domain. The other 40 colonies had multiple point mutations and were not analyzed further. Each of the 17 single point mutants were reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis of native BCR-ABL and found to be approximately 2.5- to 800-fold more resistant to AMN107 than native BCR-ABL.

Continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib resulted in the selection of K562/IMA-0.2 and -1 cells, which expressed approximately 2.3- and 19-fold resistance, respectively. Measurement of endogenous ceramides by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy showed that treatment with imatinib increased the generation of ceramide, mainly C18-ceramide, which is generated by the human longevity assurance gene 1 (hLASS1), in sensitive, but not in resistant cells. Inhibition of hLASS1 by small interfering RNA partially prevented imatinib-induced cell death in sensitive cells. In reciprocal experiments, overexpression of hLASS1, and not hLASS6, in drug-resistant cells caused a marked increase in imatinib-induced C18-ceramide generation, and enhanced apoptosis. Interestingly, there were no defects in the levels of mRNA and enzyme activity levels of hLASS1 for ceramide generation in K562/IMA-1 cells. However, expression levels of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) and generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were increased significantly in K562/IMA-1 cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the sphingosine kinase pathway. The partial inhibition of SK1 expression by small interference RNA modulated S1P levels and increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. On the other hand, forced expression of SK1 in K562 cells increased the ratio between total S1P/C18-ceramide levels approximately 6-fold and prevented apoptosis significantly in response to imatinib. Additional data indicated a role for SK1/S1P signaling in the up-regulation of the Bcr-Abl expression at the post-transcriptional level, which suggested a possible mechanism for resistance to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, these data suggest a role for endogenous C18-ceramide synthesis mainly via hLASS1 in imatinib-induced apoptosis in sensitive cells, whereas in resistant cells, alterations of the balance between the levels of ceramide and S1P by overexpression of SK1 result in resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis.","['Baran, Yusuf', 'Salas, Arelis', 'Senkal, Can E', 'Gunduz, Ufuk', 'Bielawski, Jacek', 'Obeid, Lina M', 'Ogretmen, Besim']","['Baran Y', 'Salas A', 'Senkal CE', 'Gunduz U', 'Bielawski J', 'Obeid LM', 'Ogretmen B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Hollings Cancer Center, Ralph H.

Robust classifiers are needed that use most biologically relevant genes embedded in the data. A consensus approach that combines multiple classifiers has attributes that mitigate this difficulty compared to a single classifier. A new classification method named as consensus analysis of multiple classifiers using non-repetitive variables (CAMCUN) was proposed for the analysis of hyper-dimensional gene expression data. The CAMCUN method combined multiple classifiers, each of which was built from distinct, non-repeated genes that were selected for effectiveness in class differentiation. Thus, the CAMCUN utilized most biologically relevant genes in the final classifier. The CAMCUN algorithm was demonstrated to give consistently more accurate predictions for two well-known datasets for prostate cancer and leukemia. Importantly, the CAMCUN algorithm employed an integrated 10-fold cross-validation and randomization test to assess the degree of confidence of the predictions for unknown samples.","['Su, Zhenqiang', 'Hong, Huixiao', 'Perkins, Roger', 'Shao, Xueguang', 'Cai, Wensheng', 'Tong, Weida']","['Su Z', 'Hong H', 'Perkins R', 'Shao X', 'Cai W', 'Tong W']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Comput Biol Chem,Computational biology and chemistry,101157394,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Computational Biology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Software']",2007/02/17 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1476-9271(07)00002-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2007.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Chem. 2007 Feb;31(1):48-56. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2007.01.001.

The current study compared the age at diagnosis in African Americans (AA) and whites for the 12 most frequently occurring cancers from 1996 to 2002. Using three criteria, this study determined whether cancers in most anatomic sites were more likely to occur at an earlier age in AA than in whites in the United States. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program was used to collect publicly accessible cancer data from 1996 through 2002 for AA and whites. Frequency, population size, and median age at diagnosis were collected for each of the 12 most commonly occurring cancers. These included: prostate, breast, lung, colon, urinary bladder, corpus uteri, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovary, kidney, leukemia, oral cavity and pancreas. Poisson and logistic regression were used to investigate the possible association between race/ethnicity and an earlier age at cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: In general, AA had an earlier age at diagnosis for invasive cancer compared with whites. According to the median age at diagnosis, all 12 frequently occurring cancers from 1996 to 2002 were diagnosed significantly earlier in AA than in whites. Eight of the 12 cancers reached an arbitrary rate of >or=3 cases per 100,000 persons at a significantly younger age in AA than in whites. However, the relative risk of a cancer diagnosis for persons 5-45 years of age was significantly greater for only 3 of the 12 cancers in AA. CONCLUSION: Cancers in general have an earlier age at diagnosis in AA than in whites. Earlier age at diagnosis may be another indicator of disparity since cancers that arise at a younger age tend to be more aggressive and frequently result in a less favorable outcome.","['Karami, Sara', 'Young, Heather A', 'Henson, Donald E']","['Karami S', 'Young HA', 'Henson DE']","['School of Public Health and Health Services, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*ethnology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",2007/02/17 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-090X(06)00228-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cdp.2006.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2007;31(1):29-34. doi: 10.1016/j.cdp.2006.11.004.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Reported here is a boy with relapsed leukemia who developed fatal PTR after a peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) as a second HPBPCT from his mother. To elucidate the cause of PTR, a single-antigen assay (FlowPRA, One Lambda), a magnetic particles mixed passive hemagglutination test, and anti-human immunoglobulin-lymphocyte cytotoxicity test were performed on serum samples of the patient and his mother. RESULTS: Although HLA Class I antibodies were absent in his serum sample before HPBPCT, the serum sample after the first bone marrow transplantation (BMT) reacted weakly with beads coated with multiple HLA Class I molecules. After PBPCT, the positive reaction markedly increased. Although HLA-B44 antibody emerged transiently after BMT, the apparent generation of antibodies against HLA-A2 and -A24 as well as HLA-B44 occurred after PBPCT. The continuous appearance of HLA Class I antibodies coincided with the duration of marked PTR after PBPCT. The patient, however, had no antibodies against PLT-specific glycoproteins. Unidentified HLA Class I-reactive antibodies were detected in maternal serum sample. CONCLUSION: Although the patient appeared to be immunized to allogeneic HLA Class I molecules after BMT, profound HLA alloimmunization might have occurred after PBPCT in this case. It is possible that the administration of large numbers of immunocompetent cells sensitive to alloantigens at PBPCT causes the aberrant and persistent production of the HLA Class I antibodies.","['Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Saito, Satoshi', 'Hasegawa, Yasuhisa', 'Yanagisawa, Ryu', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Kamijo, Takehiko', 'Miyazaki, Toru', 'Sato, Shinichiro', 'Ikeda, Hisami', 'Ikebuchi, Kenji', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Nakazawa Y', 'Saito S', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Yanagisawa R', 'Sakashita K', 'Kamijo T', 'Miyazaki T', 'Sato S', 'Ikeda H', 'Ikebuchi K', 'Koike K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B44 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'Child', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-B44 Antigen', 'HLA-C Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mothers', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors']",2007/02/17 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/17 09:00'],"['2007/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01109 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01109.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Feb;47(2):326-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01109.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) represent a subset of bone marrow (BM) cell subpopulation, the question of their quantification in BM grafts and the impact of BM processing on their recovery has not been addressed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective study on 77 BM products, NRBCs were enumerated by flow cytometry and the recovery analyzed after manipulation. Because NRBCs could compromise white blood cell count, the impact of NRBC count on CD34+ cell percentage and total nucleated cell (TNC) dose were also determined. RESULTS: The mean percentage of NRBCs in BM grafts was 21.6 percent (range, 7.8%-40.9%). Mean NRBC recoveries after BM concentration or RBC depletion were 98.4 and 28.7 percent, respectively, close to those obtained for TNC cells (88.6 and 31.3%, respectively). When corrected with NRBC count, the mean percentages of corrected CD34+ cell and TNC dose were significantly modified when compared with uncorrected values, whatever the type of BM manipulation.

Two focus group sessions with mothers of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and two with mothers of children with brain tumours were conducted to explore: the optimal time of day, method of administration, and location for the interview; the availability of alternative data sources; the interval between paediatric cancer diagnosis and epidemiological interview; and other features which may affect maternal interview responses. Mothers of children with both types of cancer preferred being interviewed at home during the evening and were willing to provide complete access to their offsprings' medical records. Emotional, socio-economic and perhaps cultural differences between the groups of mothers were exemplified by the willingness of mothers of children with ALL to participate in epidemiological interviews earlier in their child's treatment course and to provide greater access to maternal reproductive history records compared with mothers of children with brain tumours. Parental concerns about the difficult disease and treatment course of children with brain tumours were a key element in their decision to defer participating in epidemiological interviews for many months after their child's cancer diagnosis. We conclude that the focus group approach can contribute to a broad strategy for improving questionnaires and methods for conducting paediatric cancer epidemiological research.","['Linet, Martha S', 'Byrne, Julianne', 'Willis, Gordon B', 'Wacholder, Sholom', 'Forman, Michele R']","['Linet MS', 'Byrne J', 'Willis GB', 'Wacholder S', 'Forman MR']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Baethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA. linetm@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection/*methods', 'Female', 'Focus Groups/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design']",2007/02/17 09:00,2007/07/24 09:00,['2007/02/17 09:00'],"['2007/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['PPE792 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2007.00792.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2007 Mar;21(2):169-78. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2007.00792.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as only about 30% of recipients have an MRD for this potentially curative approach, the use of family donors with one or two mismatches in the HLA-antigens (mismatch related donor, MMRD) or fully matched unrelated donors (MUD) (''alternative donors'') has been introduced in the allogeneic SCT setting in recent years. To evaluate the feasibility of allogeneic SCT from alternative donors by using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) we initiated a prospective, phase II study in 1996. From April 1996 to July 1998, 18 patients with various hematological malignancies underwent allogeneic SCT from alternative donors (two patients with MUD and 16 patients with MMRD). All patients received stable engraftment and none of the patients had graft rejection. The rate of aGvHD (grades II-IV) and the relapse rate at last follow-up (seven to nine yr after SCT) were with 40% and 24%, respectively, comparable with those found in patients receiving allogeneic SCT from MRD. However, five yr after allogeneic SCT only 17% were alive, which was mainly due to the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of 59%. We conclude that allogeneic PBSC transplantation by using alternative donors is associated with an unsatisfying long-term TRM rate. The significance of TRM and particular late deaths has to be evaluated further in this transplantation setting.","['Blau, I W', 'Schmidt-Hieber, M', 'Basara, N', 'Hopfenmuller, W', 'Bischoff, M', 'Gunzelmann, S', 'Kirsten, D', 'Schmetzer, B', 'Roemer, E', 'Kiehl, M G', 'Thiel, E', 'Fauser, A A']","['Blau IW', 'Schmidt-Hieber M', 'Basara N', 'Hopfenmuller W', 'Bischoff M', 'Gunzelmann S', 'Kirsten D', 'Schmetzer B', 'Roemer E', 'Kiehl MG', 'Thiel E', 'Fauser AA']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Charite-Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/02/17 09:00,2007/04/05 09:00,['2007/02/17 09:00'],"['2007/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CTR614 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0012.2006.00614.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2007 Jan-Feb;21(1):110-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2006.00614.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In October 2005, routine evaluation demonstrated continuous CMR, full male donor engraftment and an inv (11) on donor cells.

Overall survival (OS), time to first treatment (TTFT) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated. Our results indicate the following: (1) TRF-L is heterogeneous among B-CLL patients (median 6014 bp, range 1465-16 762); (2) TRF-L correlates to VH-MS (r(2)=0.1994, P<0.0001) with VH-mutated patients showing long and VH-unmutated short telomeres; however, 41% of VH-unmutated and 5% of VH-mutated patients did not show this correlation and were thus defined as 'discordant'; (3) TRF-L effectively predicts outcome in terms of TTFT, PFS and OS; (4) VH-unmutated discordant patients have a better clinical outcome than VH-unmutated concordant patients (OS P<0.01, PFS P<0.05) and similar to that of VH-mutated patients (OS, PFS P=NS).

ZA treatment induces, as a side effect, inflammatory responses, which are accompanied by expansion of gammadelta T cells. In our study, we analyzed the function and differentiation of monocyte-derived immature and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated dendritic cells (moDCs) treated with different ZA concentrations, which are achieved in patients. We found that moDC activation with TLR4 ligand LPS is modulated by ZA. The expression of maturation markers was diminished with increasing ZA levels upon LPS activation. The migratory capacity, interleukin-12 secretion and generation of cytotoxic- T-cell responses were reduced at higher ZA levels. Increasing ZA concentrations downregulated nuclear factor-kappaB family members and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-3. Surprisingly, in immature moDCs, low ZA concentrations caused upregulation of RelB, c-Rel, IRF-3 and IRF-8. We conclude that ZA concentrations used to treat patients have inhibitory effects on DC activation. This might lead to immunosuppression or result in infectious complications.","['Bringmann, A', 'Schmidt, S M', 'Weck, M M', 'Brauer, K M', 'von Schwarzenberg, K', 'Werth, D', 'Grunebach, F', 'Brossart, P']","['Bringmann A', 'Schmidt SM', 'Weck MM', 'Brauer KM', 'von Schwarzenberg K', 'Werth D', 'Grunebach F', 'Brossart P']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",IM,"['Bone Density Conservation Agents/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/drug effects/*physiology', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404556 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404556 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):732-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404556.

We performed a structured cytomorphological examination of bone marrow (BM) in 221 low-grade MDS patients, this in conjunction with strict guidelines for cytopenias. A dysplasia scoring system was developed utilizing dysplastic changes, which were associated with worse outcome on univariate and multivariate analysis corrected for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Dysplasia >or=10% in one BM lineage and one cytopenia constituted the low-risk category UCUD or Unilineage Cytopenia and Unilineage Dysplasia. The high-risk category comprised patients with cytopenia in >or=2 lineages and dysplasia in >or=2 BM lineages, namely MCMD or Multilineage Cytopenia and Multilineage Dysplasia. Intermediate-risk patients had one cytopenia and multilineage dysplasia, or cytopenia in >or=2 lineages and unilineage BM dysplasia, designated UCMD/MCUD or Unilineage Cytopenia and Multilineage Dysplasia/Multilineage Cytopenia and Unilineage Dysplasia. This system utilizing cytopenia-dysplasia scoring at diagnosis enabled comprehensive categorization of low-grade MDS cases that predicted for overall as well as leukemia-free survival. Cytopenia-dysplasia categorization added additional prognostic values to the lower risk IPSS categories. This suggests that a standardized dysplasia scoring system, used in conjunction with cytopenia, could improve diagnostic and prognostic sub-categorization of MDS patients.","['Verburgh, E', 'Achten, R', 'Louw, V J', 'Brusselmans, C', 'Delforge, M', 'Boogaerts, M', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Verhoef, G']","['Verburgh E', 'Achten R', 'Louw VJ', 'Brusselmans C', 'Delforge M', 'Boogaerts M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Verhoef G']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospitals, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. estelle.verburgh@student.kuleuven.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Karyotyping', 'Megaloblasts/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'World Health Organization']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404564 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404564 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):668-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404564.

Previous epidemiological studies reported a potential protective effect of MTHFR677C --> T against acute lymphocytic leukemia and malignant lymphoma, but the mechanism remains to be determined. We investigated the biochemical impacts of MTHFR677C --> T on cellular S-adenosyl methionine (adoMet) synthesis, global DNA methylation, and de novo purine synthesis, all of which are potential regulatory pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Metabolic fluxes of homocysteine remethylation and de novo purine synthesis were compared between Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts expressing MTHFR 677C and MTHFR 677T using stable isotopic tracers and GCMS. MTHFR TT genotype significantly reduced folate-dependent remethylation under folate restriction, reflecting limited methylated folates under folate restriction. Data also suggested increased formylated folate pool and increased purine synthesis when folate is adequate. The impacts of MTHFR 677T polymorphism appeared closely related to folate status, and such alterations may modulate metabolic pathways involved in cancer onset/progression. The advantage of de novo purine synthesis found in the MTHFR TT genotype may account for the protective effect of MTHFR in hematological malignancies. These transformed cells are potential models for studying the consequences of human genetic variation and cancer pathogenesis.","['Chiang, E-P', 'Wang, Y-C', 'Tang, F-Y']","['Chiang EP', 'Wang YC', 'Tang FY']","['Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. chiangisabel@nchu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Folic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*biosynthesis']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404575 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404575 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):651-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404575.

The presence of T-cell clones was not associated with features linked previously to immunosuppression response, including WHO diagnostic category, karyotype, marrow cellularity, IPSS category, sex or age <or=60. Using flow cytometry to identify expanded Vbeta-families, we found that T cells showed greater expansion in the bone marrow compared with peripheral blood, and were characterized as CD8(+)/CD57(+)/CD28(-) effector T cells.

MRD detection is particularly useful for evaluation of early treatment response and consequently for improved front-line therapy stratification. MRD information is also significant for children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and those with relapsed ALL. Currently, three highly specific and sensitive methodologies for MRD detection are available, namely multiparameter flow cytometric immunophenotyping, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)-based detection of fusion gene transcripts or breakpoints, and RQ-PCR-based detection of clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. In this review, characteristics, pitfalls, advantages and disadvantages of each MRD technique are critically discussed. The special emphasis is put on interlaboratory standardization, especially in view of the results obtained within the European collaborative BIOMED-1, BIOMED-2, and Europe Against Cancer projects and recent developments by European Study Group on MRD detection in ALL and EuroFlow Consortium. Standardized MRD techniques form the basis for stratification of patients into the risk groups in new treatment protocols mainly in childhood ALL. Only the results of these studies can answer the question whether MRD-based treatment intervention is associated with improved outcome.","['Szczepanski, T']",['Szczepanski T'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Silesian Medical Academy, Zabrze, Poland. szczep57@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404603 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404603 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):622-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404603.

Approximately 5% of AIDS patients have atypical granulomatous histology. CASE REPORT/METHODS: A 75-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was treated with alemtuzumab (campath-1H) 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. After completion of therapy she presented with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates. Bronchoscopy with biopsy revealed Pneumocystis organisms with granulomatous history. She responded well to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. RESULTS/LITERATURE REVIEW: Our literature review identified 19 patients without AIDS who had granulomatous Pneumocystis infection. These patients often had nodular infiltrates on x-rays and negative bronchoalveolar lavage study findings. Most patients required open lung biopsies. Histologic specimens frequently revealed necrosis. These patients responded well to therapy. CONCLUSION: The limited information available from these studies suggests that these patients have immune reconstitution-like syndrome related to either increasing numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes following therapeutic suppression or impaired modulation of CD4+ function. This unusual clinical presentation may delay diagnosis and effective therapy.","['Otahbachi, Mohammed', 'Nugent, Kenneth', 'Buscemi, Dolores']","['Otahbachi M', 'Nugent K', 'Buscemi D']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Pneumocystis carinii/*isolation & purification', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/complications/*diagnosis/*immunology']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)32632-X [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-200702000-00014 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2007 Feb;333(2):131-5. doi: 10.1097/00000441-200702000-00014.,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance is often reported in advanced-stage CML patients. Several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have been developed to override imatinib resistance mechanism due to point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. Quite recently we successfully developed the novel Bcr-Abl/Lyn dual inhibitor INNO-406 (NS-187) which shows unique profile to overcome this resistance. Inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase are divided into two groups, ATP-competitive and non-competitive inhibitors. ATP-competitive inhibitors are further fall into two subclasses, the Src/Abl inhibitors and 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based compounds. Dasatinib (BMS-354825, Sprycel) is classified as Src/Ablinhibitors while nilotinib (AMN 107) and INNO-406 (NS-187) belong to the latter. Among them, clinical studies on dasatinib and AMN 107 had started earlier than the others and favorable results are accumulating. We have performed basic and preclinical studies of INNO-406 (NS-187) in Japan, and then its clinical trials have been commenced firstly in the United States from July, 2006.

Pediatric SCT has become rather sophisticated. Cord blood (CB) stem cell transplantation has the problem of rejection and high relapse rate in the advanced malignant diseases. To overcome the rejection and relapse, it is important to select CB with a large number of the cells and the HLA-mismatched CB.

The results were analyzed by statistical tests (post hoc). From these data, it was found that Fas antigen was expressed in all cases, but the expression level varied widely. Apoptosis and also Fas antigen expression in short term cell culture were higher in media containing drug than in media without drug; but there had been no reasonable correlation between percentage of Fas antigen and apoptosis responses before culture.Expression of Fas antigen was low in most of the leukemic cells and the preliminary results showed that increase in Fas antigen expression (above 20%) after treatment, was a favorable prognostic outcome.

Crosslinking of Fas by its ligand (Fas L) or agonistic anti Fas antibodies induces apoptosis of cells expressing Fas on the membrane by triggering cascade of caspaces. The aim of this research was to study the percent of expression of Fas antigen on bone marrow and peripheral blood cells in 100 patients suffering from acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia by flow cytometry method. Sample were obtained at the time of diagnosis before antileukemic therapy. Expression of Fas antigen on normal control peripheral leukocytes was also analysed. From these data, it was found that Fas antigen is expressed in all cases, but the expression level varied widely. The percentage of Fas antigen expression in all of acute lymphoid leukemia samples was below 20%, but in acute myeloid leukemia samples, 8 out of 50 cases was above 20%. In normal control samples, the mean value for monocytes was higher than granulocytes and in granulocytes higher than lymphcytes. Expression of Fas antigen in most of the leukemic cells was low and the preliminary results showed that increase in Fas antigen expression above 20% after treatment, is a favorable prognostic sign associated with increase relapse free and total survival. Thus evaluation of this antigen before, during and after treatment is recommended.","['Zandieh, Tahereh', 'Safari Fard, Asghar', 'Aghaipur, Mahnaz']","['Zandieh T', 'Safari Fard A', 'Aghaipur M']","['Department of Research Center of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organisation Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",101146178,,,,2007/02/16 09:00,2007/02/16 09:01,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:01 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0204198207 [pii]', '02.04/ijaai.198207 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2003 Dec;2(4):198-207. doi: 02.04/ijaai.198207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of the present study were to investigate wild felid species as possible reservoirs of feline hemoplasmas and the molecular characterization of the hemoplasma isolates. Blood samples from the following 257 wild felids were analyzed: 35 Iberian lynxes from Spain, 36 Eurasian lynxes from Switzerland, 31 European wildcats from France, 45 lions from Tanzania, and 110 Brazilian wild felids, including 12 wild felid species kept in zoos and one free-ranging ocelot. Using real-time PCR, feline hemoplasmas were detected in samples of the following species: Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, European wildcat, lion, puma, oncilla, Geoffroy's cat, margay, and ocelot. ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" was the most common feline hemoplasma in Iberian lynxes, Eurasian lynxes, Serengeti lions, and Brazilian wild felids, whereas ""Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" was the most prevalent in European wildcats; hemoplasma coinfections were frequently observed. Hemoplasma infection was associated with species and free-ranging status of the felids in all animals and with feline leukemia virus provirus-positive status in European wildcats. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA and the partial RNase P gene revealed that most hemoplasma isolates exhibit high sequence identities to domestic cat-derived isolates, although some isolates form different subclusters within the phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, 9 out of 15 wild felid species from three different continents were found to be infected with feline hemoplasmas.

The 3'-terminal 18 nucleotides of the tRNA are complementary to the primer binding site (PBS). Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) preferentially captures tRNA(Pro). To investigate the specificity of primer selection, the PBS of MuLV was altered to be complementary to different tRNAs. Analysis of the infectivity of the virus and stability of the PBS following in vitro replication revealed that MuLV prefers to select tRNA(Pro), tRNA(Gly), or tRNA(Arg). Previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that tRNA primer capture is coordinated with translation. Coincidentally, a cluster of proline, arginine, and glycine precedes the Gag-Pol junction of MuLV. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which prefers tRNA(3)(Lys) as the primer, can be forced to utilize tRNA(Met), tRNA(1,2)(Lys), tRNA(His), or tRNA(Glu), although these viruses replicate poorly. Codons for methionine, lysine, histidine, or glutamic acid are found prior to the Gag-Pol frameshift site. HIV-1 was mutated so that the 5 lysine codons prior to the Gag-Pol frameshift region were specific for tRNA(1,2)(Lys). HIV-1 forced to use tRNA(1,2)(Lys) as the primer, with the mutation of codons specific for tRNA(1,2)(Lys) prior to the Gag-Pol junction, had enhanced infectivity and replicated similarly to the wild-type virus. The results demonstrate that codon preference prior to the Gag-Pol junction influences primer selection and suggest a coordination of Gag-Pol synthesis and acquisition of the tRNA primer required for retrovirus replication.","['Palmer, Matthew T', 'Kirkman, Richard', 'Kosloff, Barry R', 'Eipers, Peter G', 'Morrow, Casey D']","['Palmer MT', 'Kirkman R', 'Kosloff BR', 'Eipers PG', 'Morrow CD']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 720 20th Street South, Kaul 802, Birmingham, AL 35294-0024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Transfer/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics/physiology']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02643-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02643-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 May;81(9):4397-404. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02643-06.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-five women below the age of 60 years with operated high-risk primary breast cancer were randomised to nine cycles of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor supported and individually tailored FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), (n = 251) or standard FEC followed by marrow-supported high-dose therapy with CTCb (cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin) therapy (n = 274), followed by locoregional radiotherapy and tamoxifen for 5 years. RESULTS: There were 104 breast cancer relapses in the tailored FEC group versus 139 in the CTCb group (double triangular method by Whitehead, P = 0.046), with a median follow-up of all included patients of 60.8 months.

An apoptogenic ingredient in the methylene chloride extract was further purified by silica gel column chromatography and identified as auraptene (AUR). The IC(50) value of AUR against Jurkat T cells was 16.5 microg/ml. After the treatment of Jurkat T cells with AUR, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated activation of caspase-12 and -8 and subsequent apoptotic events including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, cleavage of FLICE inhibitory protein and Bid, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9 and -3, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were induced in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity of AUR was not blocked by the anti-Fas neutralizing antibody ZB-4. The AUR-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic events were abrogated by ectopic over-expression of Bcl-xL or addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. The individual or simultaneous addition of the m-calpain inhibitor (E64d), JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor (CsA) failed to prevent apoptotic events including caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, unless the caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) was combined, whereas AUR-induced caspase-12 activation was sustained even in the concomitant presence of z-IETD-fmk. These results demonstrated that the apoptotic effect of AUR on Jurkat T cells was exerted by the ER stress-mediated activation of caspase-8, and the subsequent induction of mitochondria-dependent or -independent activation of caspase cascade, which could be suppressed by Bcl-xL.","['Jun, Do Y', 'Kim, Jun S', 'Park, Hae S', 'Han, Cho R', 'Fang, Zhe', 'Woo, Mi H', 'Rhee, In K', 'Kim, Young H']","['Jun DY', 'Kim JS', 'Park HS', 'Han CR', 'Fang Z', 'Woo MH', 'Rhee IK', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Coumarins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'F79I1ZEL2E (aurapten)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism/physiology', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phytotherapy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', '*Zanthoxylum']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/08/08 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgm028 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgm028 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2007 Jun;28(6):1303-13. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgm028.

Reported herein is a unique and informative case of gastric peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a cytotoxic phenotype that histologically mimicked, and had to be carefully distinguished from, MALT-type B-cell lymphoma. The patient, a 73-year-old woman, underwent a gastric endoscopy examination, and the histological findings suggested MALT-type gastric lymphoma. Analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene and T cell receptor gamma (TCRgamma) gene revealed monoclonal rearrangement of the TCRgamma gene. The tumor cells exhibited mild atypia and immunoreactivity with anti-CD3, anti-CD8, anti-T-cell intracellular antigen-1, antigranzyme B and antiperforin antibodies, but not with anti-CD20, anti-CD10, and anti-CD79a antibodies. The case was finally diagnosed as gastric T-cell lymphoma with cytotoxic phenotype, and this was confirmed after surgical resection. In cases such as this, small biopsy specimens from the stomach should be examined carefully for low grade B-cell-type malignant lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), because sometimes the proliferating B cells can hide the truly malignant T cells, and rearrangement analysis is useful for diagnosing T-cell malignancy.","['Sugita, Shintaro', 'Iijima, Tatsuo', 'Furuya, Shuichiro', 'Kano, Junko', 'Yanaka, Akinori', 'Ohta, Keiichiro', 'Kojima, Hiroshi', 'Noguchi, Masayuki']","['Sugita S', 'Iijima T', 'Furuya S', 'Kano J', 'Yanaka A', 'Ohta K', 'Kojima H', 'Noguchi M']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*pathology']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/06/20 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN2065 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.02065.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2007 Feb;57(2):108-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.02065.x.,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been reported that in cyclin D3-deficient mice, normal expansion of T lymphocytes is impaired because of maturation arrest at the double-negative thymocyte stage, suggesting a crucial role for cyclin D3 in early T-cell development. Therefore, cyclin D3 expression was examined in 36 human precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas (T-LBLL), a neoplastic counterpart of T cells at the early developmental stages of differentiation. Using a standard panel of differentiation markers, all T-LBLL were categorized into four stages according to differentiation: progenitor, double-negative, double-positive, and single-positive stages. Cyclin D3 expression was initiated at the boundary between double-negative and double-positive stages, and was sustained in the single-positive stage. T-cell receptor was expressed simultaneously with cyclin D3, whereas CD79a expression was specific in the double-negative stage, and thus it was inversely correlated with that of cyclin D3. Taken together with the crucial and non-redundant role in T-cell development in mice, this molecule is suggested to play an important role in human T-cell development.","['Sasaki, Eiichi', 'Yatabe, Yasushi', 'Hashimoto, Mitsuyoshi', 'Yamashita, Yoriko', 'Hasegawa, Yuichi', 'Kojima, Hiroshi', 'Nagasawa, Toshiro', 'Mori, Naoyoshi']","['Sasaki E', 'Yatabe Y', 'Hashimoto M', 'Yamashita Y', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kojima H', 'Nagasawa T', 'Mori N']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['CD79 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/06/20 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN2058 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.02058.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2007 Feb;57(2):53-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.02058.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although the total age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for people with Down syndrome were similar to that for the general population, SIRs for leukaemia were significantly higher while the incidence of certain other types of cancers was reduced.

STAT functional activity can be variably regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and sumoylation. Additionally, limited proteolytic digestion of full-length STAT proteins (STATalpha) generates C-terminally truncated forms (STATgamma) in different cell lineages, which have significantly reduced transcriptional activity due to the lack of the transactivation domain. Previously, it has been shown that STAT5gamma, generated by an unidentified nuclear serine protease, plays an important role in myeloid cell differentiation and is aberrantly expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia. To better understand this regulatory mechanism for STAT5 function, we have purified the STAT5 protease from the immature myeloid cell line 32D and identified it by MS analysis as the granule-derived serine protease, CatG (cathepsin G). We show that purified CatG can specifically cleave full-length STAT5 to generate STAT5gamma, and this activity can be inhibited by AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride] in an in vitro protease assay. Importantly, preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from immature myeloid cell lines, 32D and FDC-P1, in the presence of a specific inhibitor for CatG results in the identification of STAT5alpha only. These studies indicate that nuclear STAT5gamma does not naturally exist in immature myeloid cells and is artificially generated from STAT5alpha during the preparation of extracts due to the abundance of CatG in these cells. Therefore in contrast with earlier studies, our data suggest that STAT5alpha, rather than STAT5gamma is the active form in immature myeloid cells.","['Schuster, Bjorn', 'Hendry, Lisa', 'Byers, Helen', 'Lynham, Steven F', 'Ward, Malcolm A', 'John, Susan']","['Schuster B', 'Hendry L', 'Byers H', 'Lynham SF', 'Ward MA', 'John S']","[""Division of Infection, Immunity and Inflammatory Diseases, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peptide Hydrolases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20061877 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20061877 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2007 May 15;404(1):81-7. doi: 10.1042/BJ20061877.,"['G0400197/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC1868840,,['Biochem J. 2007 May 15;404(1):e1-2.

In most cases the donor was an HLA-identical sibling (164; 55.6%) or a voluntary unrelated donor from the register (110; 37.3%), in a minority of cases another relative of the patient (21; 7.1%). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 90% of patients. The source of hematopoietic stem cells was bone marrow in 57%, peripheral blood in 41% and combination of both in 2% of cases. 83.4% of patients underwent transplant in the chronic phase of the illness while 7.8% in the acceleration phase and 6.1% in the blastic phase respectively. The median interval from the diagnosis to SCT was 316 days. Median follow-up after SCT was 2 years. SCT was complicated by acute graft versus host disease of grade II-IV in 33.7% of patients and by chronic graft versus host disease in 36.3% of patients. Median survival was not reached, 18 (6.1%) of patients died due to the relapse of CML and the cause of 101 (34.2%) deaths was transplant-related. Significant trends were observed during the study period: SCT were performed more frequently in older patients, less than one year from the diagnosis, reduced-intensity conditioning was used more often and the source of hematopoietic stem cells was peripheral blood in the majority of patients (p = 0.188 - < 0.0001). Also, transplantation activity changed - the annual rate of SCT increased steadily until 1999, while there was no such an increase between 2000 and 2005. The use of peripheral stem cells was associated with chronic graft versus host disease (p = 0.007). In Cox multivariate analysis the EBMT risk score and the interval from the diagnosis to SCT were identified as independent factors in patient survival. An ""ideal"" patient, aged under 30, undergoing transplant in the chronic phase of CML within one year since the diagnosis after 2000 had a survival probability of 88% for three years after SCT. It can be concluded that results of allogeneic SCT in CML in the Czech Republic reflect current global trends, are comparable with results achieved in other countries and show significant improvements.","['Faber, E', 'Koza, V', 'Vitek, A', 'Mayer, J', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Zak, P', 'Zapletalova, J', 'Benesova, K', 'Krejcova, H', 'Steinerova, K', 'Maresova, I', 'Cetkovsky, P']","['Faber E', 'Koza V', 'Vitek A', 'Mayer J', 'Sedlacek P', 'Zak P', 'Zapletalova J', 'Benesova K', 'Krejcova H', 'Steinerova K', 'Maresova I', 'Cetkovsky P']",['Hemato-onkologicka klinika Lekarske fakulty UP a FN Olomouc. edgar.faber@fnol.cz'],['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/02/16 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2006 Dec;52(12):1172-80.,,,,['Vnitr Lek. 2006 Dec;52(12):1146-7.

Uranium particulate is generated by DU shell impact and particulate entrained in air may be inhaled or ingested by troops and nearby civilian populations. As uranium is slightly radioactive and chemically toxic, a number of critics have asserted that DU exposure has resulted in a variety of adverse health effects for exposed veterans and nearby civilian populations. The study described in this paper used mathematical modeling to estimate health risks from exposure to DU during the 1991 Gulf War for both US troops and nearby Iraqi civilians. The analysis found that the risks of DU-induced leukemia or birth defects are far too small to result in an observable increase in these health effects among exposed veterans or Iraqi civilians. The analysis indicated that only a few ( approximately 5) US veterans in vehicles accidentally targeted by US tanks received significant exposure levels, resulting in about a 1.4% lifetime risk of DU radiation-induced fatal cancer (compared with about a 24% risk of a fatal cancer from all other causes). These veterans may have also experienced temporary kidney damage. Iraqi children playing for 500 h in DU-destroyed vehicles are predicted to incur a cancer risk of about 0.4%. In vitro and animal tests suggest the possibility of chemically induced health effects from DU internalization, such as immune system impairment. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of these findings for Gulf War exposure to DU. Veterans and civilians who did not occupy DU-contaminated vehicles are unlikely to have internalized quantities of DU significantly in excess of normal internalization of natural uranium from the environment.","['Marshall, Albert C']",['Marshall AC'],"['Consultant for Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87047, USA. physbang1@msn.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,101262796,"['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis/etiology', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Gulf War', 'Humans', 'Immune System/pathology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/etiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Persian Gulf Syndrome/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Public Health', 'Radioactive Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Uranium/analysis/*toxicity']",2007/02/15 09:00,2008/03/19 09:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['7500551 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.jes.7500551 [doi]']",ppublish,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol. 2008 Jan;18(1):95-108. doi: 10.1038/sj.jes.7500551.

Their intent was not directly therapeutic but rather to track the behavior and fate of cells in vivo, and to use this information to improve treatment protocols. For more than fifteen years, gene-marking studies using retroviral vectors have provided invaluable information about the biology of human hematopoietic cells and T lymphocytes, and have helped guide cell therapies intended to treat malignant disease. Although the safety record of marking studies has been impeccable, the development of leukemia by immunodeficient children treated with retroviral vectors cast a pall over the entire field and essentially brought the era of pure gene-marking studies to an abrupt end. Paradoxically, the impetus these events gave to studying retroviral integration sites in host cell DNA emphasized the additional information that marker studies could provide about the behavior of cells at the clonal level. As confidence has slowly returned, marker studies have reappeared, usually as components of gene therapy protocols in which a marker gene or sequence is incorporated to allow the modified cells to be tracked or imaged in vivo. Hence, gene marking continues to have much to offer in terms of our understanding of the behavior, fate, and safety of gene-modified cells in vivo.","['Tey, Siok-Keen', 'Brenner, Malcolm K']","['Tey SK', 'Brenner MK']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. stey@bcm.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Safety', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2007/02/15 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31333-8 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300109 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2007 Apr;15(4):666-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300109.

LIF acts through a cell-surface receptor complex formed by two subunits, the specific LIF receptor beta (LIFRbeta) and the glycoprotein 130. Little is known about LIF involvement in modulating the neuroendocrine circuitry governing the reproductive function and, specifically, the development of GnRH-secreting neurons. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of LIF on the in vitro migration of GN11 cells, a model of immature and migratory GnRH neurons, and the signaling pathways involved in this process. GN11 cells expressed both LIFRbeta and glycoprotein 130 subunits. Exposure of GN11 cells to 100 ng/ml LIF resulted in activation of the Janus kinases (Jaks)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, MAPK/ERK1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/Akt pathways. The selective inhibition of Jaks, MAPK kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase indicated that these signaling pathways were activated independently by LIF and that Jak2 is not the main kinase involved in LIF signaling. Exposure of GN11 cells to LIF for 3 h induced a concentration-dependent chemotactic response, with a plateau at 100 ng/ml LIF. LIF was also found to induce chemokinesis of GN11 cells. Furthermore, LIF-promoted GN11 migration was the result of the partial and independent contribution of all the three signaling pathways activated by LIF. The present data, together with the observation that LIF and LIFRbeta are expressed prenatally in the mouse nasal compartment, would suggest that LIF might participate in the migration of GnRH neurons.","['Magni, Paolo', 'Dozio, Elena', 'Ruscica, Massimiliano', 'Watanobe, Hajime', 'Cariboni, Anna', 'Zaninetti, Roberta', 'Motta, Marcella', 'Maggi, Roberto']","['Magni P', 'Dozio E', 'Ruscica M', 'Watanobe H', 'Cariboni A', 'Zaninetti R', 'Motta M', 'Maggi R']","['Department of Endocrinology, Center of Excellence on Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Milan, via G.

To investigate its prevalence, 376 patients with persistent unexplained hypereosinophilia were screened by the United Kingdom reference laboratory, revealing 40 positive cases (11%). To determine response kinetics following imatinib, real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assays were developed and evaluated in samples accrued from across the European LeukemiaNet. The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript was detected at a sensitivity of 1 in 10(5) in serial dilution of the EOL-1 cell line. Normalized FIP1L1-PDGFRA transcript levels in patient samples prior to imatinib varied by almost 3 logs. Serial monitoring was undertaken in patients with a high level of FIP1L1-PDGFRA expression prior to initiation of imatinib (100 mg/d-400 mg/d).

HTLV-1 infects T lymphocytes in vivo, where, like HIV-1, it is likely to encounter hA3G. HIV-1 counteracts the innate antiviral activity of hA3G by producing an accessory protein, Vif, which hastens the degradation of hA3G. In contrast, HTLV-1 does not encode a Vif homologue; instead, HTLV-1 has evolved a cis-acting mechanism to prevent hA3G restriction. We demonstrate here that a peptide motif in the C terminus of the HTLV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) domain inhibits hA3G packaging into nascent virions. Mutation of amino acids within this region resulted in increased levels of hA3G incorporation into virions and increased susceptibility to hA3G restriction. Elements within the C-terminal extension of the NC domain are highly conserved among the primate T cell leukemia viruses, but this extension is absent in all other retroviral NC proteins.","['Derse, David', 'Hill, Shawn A', 'Princler, Gerald', 'Lloyd, Patricia', 'Heidecker, Gisela']","['Derse D', 'Hill SA', 'Princler G', 'Lloyd P', 'Heidecker G']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA. derse@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Products, vif/chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV-1', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleocapsid/*chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects', 'Repressor Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Virus Assembly/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2007/02/15 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['0609444104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0609444104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Feb 20;104(8):2915-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0609444104.

It has been shown that the function of DCs is impaired and their population decreases in cancer-bearing hosts. Recent observations suggest that the inability of DCs could be a result of the immunosuppression mediated by soluble factors secreted by tumor cells. This study was to investigate the effects of soluble factors secreted by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells on the differentiation, maturation, apoptosis, and functions of DCs derived from normal mononuclear cells. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were cultured with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), in the presence or absence of 24-hour culture supernatants from fresh primary AML cells, to generate immature DCs. The maturation of DCs was induced by cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and prostaglandin-2 (PGE-2). The phenotypic and apoptotic alterations of DCs were evaluated using flow cytometry. Precursor frequency (PF) was calculated to monitor the allostimulatory effects of DCs on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. RESULTS: AML cell supernatant-treated DCs showed significantly lower expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and reduced response to cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and PGE-2. The apoptosis rate was significantly lower in AML cell supernatant-treated DCs than in control DCs [(29.4+/-9.5)% vs. (15.1+/-4.2)%, P<0.01]. The allostimulatory effects of AML cell supernatant-treated DCs on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower than those of normal mature DCs [PF: (1.8+/-0.5)% vs. (5.2+/-1.6)% for CD4+ T cells, (2.1+/-0.6)% vs. (6.5+/-2.0)% for CD8+ T cells, P<0.01]. CONCLUSION: Soluble factors derived from AML cells could inhibit development and functions of DCs.","['Wang, Xing-Bing', 'Liu, Jun', 'Wu, Jing-Sheng', 'Sun, Zi-Min', 'Huang, Shi-Ang']","['Wang XB', 'Liu J', 'Wu JS', 'Sun ZM', 'Huang SA']","['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, PR China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Culture Media)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Media', '*Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology']",2007/02/15 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X200702142 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Feb;26(2):142-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These gene products are stored in the oocyte and become functional during resumption of meiosis and zygote genome activation, and in embryonic stem cells. To date, a few maternal effect genes have been identified in mammals. Epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important during early embryonic development and involve DNA methylation and post-translational modification of core histones. During development, two families of proteins have been shown to be involved in epigenetic changes: Trithorax group (Trx-G) and Polycomb group (Pc-G) proteins. Trx-G proteins function as transcriptional activators and have been shown to accumulate in the oocyte. Deletion of Trx-G members using conventional knockout technology results in embryonic lethality in the majority of the cases analysed to date. Recent studies using conditional knockout mice have revealed that at least one family member is necessary for zygote genome activation. We propose that other Trx-G members may also regulate embryonic genome activation and that the use of oocyte-specific deletor mouse lines will help clarify their roles in this process.","['Andreu-Vieyra, Claudia', 'Matzuk, Martin M']","['Andreu-Vieyra C', 'Matzuk MM']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Reprod Biomed Online,Reproductive biomedicine online,101122473,['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/02/15 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1472-6483(10)60788-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s1472-6483(10)60788-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Biomed Online. 2007 Feb;14(2):201-7. doi: 10.1016/s1472-6483(10)60788-2.,,,,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence has now started to accumulate that this is not the case, and that signal joints play unsuspected roles in events that might compromise genomic integrity. Here we show both ex vivo and in vivo that the episomal circles excised during the normal process of receptor gene rearrangement may be reintegrated into the genome through trans-V(D)J recombination occurring between the episomal signal joint and an immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor target. We further demonstrate that cryptic recombination sites involved in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations constitute hotspots of insertion. Eventually, the identification of two in vivo cases associating episomal reintegration and chromosomal translocation suggests that reintegration events are linked to genomic instability.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 31 CNS hemangioblastomas from 25 VHL patients were resected and analyzed. Tumor cells from the hemangioblastomas were characterized, grown, and differentiated into multiple lineages. Resected hemangioblastomas were located in the cerebellum (11 tumors), brainstem (five tumors), and spinal cord (15 tumors). Consistent with an embryologically derived hemangioblast, the neoplastic cells demonstrated coexpression of the mesodermal markers brachyury, Flk-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor-2), and stem cell leukemia (Scl). The neoplastic cells also expressed hematopoietic stem cell antigens and receptors including CD133, CD34, c-kit, Scl, erythropoietin, and erythropoietin receptor. Under specific microenvironments, neoplastic cells (hemangioblasts) were expanded and differentiated into erythrocytic, granulocytic, and endothelial progenitors. Deletion of the wild-type VHL allele in the hematopoietic and endothelial progeny confirmed their neoplastic origin. CONCLUSIONS: The neoplastic cell of origin for CNS hemangioblastomas in VHL patients is the mesoderm-derived, embryologically arrested hemangioblast. The hematopoietic and endothelial differentiation potential of these cells can be reactivated under suitable conditions. These findings may also explain the unique tissue distribution of tumor involvement.","['Park, Deric M', 'Zhuang, Zhengping', 'Chen, Ling', 'Szerlip, Nicholas', 'Maric, Irina', 'Li, Jie', 'Sohn, Taesung', 'Kim, Stephanie H', 'Lubensky, Irina A', 'Vortmeyer, Alexander O', 'Rodgers, Griffin P', 'Oldfield, Edward H', 'Lonser, Russell R']","['Park DM', 'Zhuang Z', 'Chen L', 'Szerlip N', 'Maric I', 'Li J', 'Sohn T', 'Kim SH', 'Lubensky IA', 'Vortmeyer AO', 'Rodgers GP', 'Oldfield EH', 'Lonser RR']","['Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS Med,PLoS medicine,101231360,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD13 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hemangioblastoma/complications/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'von Hippel-Lindau Disease/*complications/pathology']",2007/02/15 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/02/15 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['06-PLME-RA-0643R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pmed.0040060 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Med. 2007 Feb;4(2):e60. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040060.,,PMC1796910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we revealed a positive correlation between the appearance of an antibody recognizing the gp46-197 region (anti-gp46-197 antibody) and the severity of ATL. The prevalence and titer of the anti-gp46-197 antibody were found to be elevated along with the progression of ATL. In serial samples obtained from a single patient, the anti-gp46-197 antibody was detected before treatment in acute phase, then diminished after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, to which the patient had a complete response. However, the antibody appeared again before a relapse, along with an increase of the serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor level and proviral load. The results from the other six patients also indicate that seroconversion of this antibody was synchronized with the deterioration of ATL. Taken together, the findings indicate that the anti-gp46-197 antibody may be a novel beacon for gauging the efficacy of therapeutic approaches to ATL, and a survey of this antibody would be useful for identifying asymptomatic carriers infected with HTLV-1 who are at high risk of developing ATL.","['Sagara, Yasuko', 'Inoue, Yukiko', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Kojima, Eijiro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Tsujimura, Mitsushi', 'Shiraki, Hiroshi', 'Kashiwagi, Seizaburo']","['Sagara Y', 'Inoue Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Kojima E', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Tsujimura M', 'Shiraki H', 'Kashiwagi S']","['Department of Research, Fukuoka Red Cross Blood Center, 1-2-1 Kamikoga, Chikushino, Fukuoka 818-8588, Japan. y-sagara@fukuoka.bc.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/*immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/02/24 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00370.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Feb;98(2):240-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00370.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Sci. 2007 Apr;98(4):620'],,,,,

We reported previously that sequestration of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complexes represses ALT-mediated telomere length maintenance, and suppresses formation of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs). APBs are PML bodies containing telomeric DNA and telomere-binding proteins, and are observed only in a small fraction of cells within asynchronously dividing ALT-positive cell populations. Here, we report that methionine restriction caused a reversible arrest in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and reversible induction of APB formation in most cells within an ALT-positive population. We combined methionine restriction with RNA interference to test whether the following proteins are required for APB formation: PML body-associated proteins, PML and Sp100; telomere-associated proteins, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2 and RAP1; and DNA repair proteins, MRE11, RAD50, NBS1 and 53BP1. APB formation was not decreased by depletion of Sp100 (as reported previously) or of 53BP1, although 53BP1 partially colocalizes with APBs. Depletion of the other proteins suppressed APB formation. Because of the close linkage between ALT-mediated telomere maintenance and ability to form APBs, the eight proteins identified by this screen as being required for APB formation are also likely to be required for the ALT mechanism.","['Jiang, W-Q', 'Zhong, Z-H', 'Henson, J D', 'Reddel, R R']","['Jiang WQ', 'Zhong ZH', 'Henson JD', 'Reddel RR']","[""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TINF2 protein, human)', '0 (TP53BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/physiology', 'Autoantigens/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'G1 Phase', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Methionine/deficiency', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Telomere/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210260 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210260 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jul 12;26(32):4635-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210260.

Here, we investigated the consequences of JunB deficiency using Abelson-induced B-lymphoid leukemia as a model system. Mice deficient in JunB expression succumbed to Abelson-induced leukemia with increased incidence and significantly reduced latency. Similarly, bcr/abl p185-transformed JunB-deficient (junB(Delta/Delta)) cells induced leukemia in RAG2(-/-) mice displaying a more malignant phenotype. These observations indicated that cell intrinsic effects within the junB(Delta/Delta) tumor cells accounted for the accelerated leukemia development. Indeed, explantated bcr/abl p185 transformed junB(Delta/Delta) cells proliferated faster than the control cells. The proliferative advantage emerged slowly after the initial transformation process and was associated with increased expression levels of the cell cycle kinase cdk6 and with decreased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a). These alterations were due to irreversible reprogramming of the cell, because - once established - accelerated disease induced by junB(Delta/Delta) cells was not reverted by re-introducing JunB. Consistent with this observation, we found that the p16 promoter was methylated. Thus, JunB functions as a gatekeeper during tumor evolution. In its absence, transformed leukemic cells acquire an enhanced proliferative capacity, which presages a more malignant disease.","['Ott, R G', 'Simma, O', 'Kollmann, K', 'Weisz, E', 'Zebedin, E M', 'Schorpp-Kistner, M', 'Heller, G', 'Zochbauer, S', 'Wagner, E F', 'Freissmuth, M', 'Sexl, V']","['Ott RG', 'Simma O', 'Kollmann K', 'Weisz E', 'Zebedin EM', 'Schorpp-Kistner M', 'Heller G', 'Zochbauer S', 'Wagner EF', 'Freissmuth M', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna (MUW), Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210285 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210285 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jul 19;26(33):4863-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210285.

We evaluated whether oblimersen would improve response to chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had received at least one prior fludarabine-containing regimen and were stratified on the basis of prior fludarabine response, number of prior regimens, and duration of response to last prior therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to 28-day cycles of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d plus cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/d administered intravenously for 3 days with or without oblimersen 3 mg/kg/d as a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion (beginning 4 days before chemotherapy) for up to six cycles. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or nodular partial response (nPR). RESULTS: Of 241 patients randomly assigned, CR/nPR was achieved in 20 (17%) of 120 patients in the oblimersen group and eight (7%) of 121 patients in the chemotherapy-only group (P = .025). Achievement of CR/nPR was correlated with both an extended time to progression and survival (P < .0001). In patients who remained sensitive to fludarabine, oblimersen was associated with a four-fold increase in the CR/nPR rate and a significant survival benefit (P = .05). Oblimersen was frequently associated with thrombocytopenia and, rarely, tumor lysis syndrome and cytokine release reactions; the incidence of opportunistic infections and second malignancies was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The addition of oblimersen to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide significantly increases the CR/nPR rate in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL (particularly fludarabine-sensitive patients), as well as response duration among patients who achieve CR/nPR.","[""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Boyd, Thomas E', 'Larratt, Loree M', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander', 'Koziner, Benjamin', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Seymour, John F', 'Bociek, R Gregory', 'Pavletic, Steve', 'Rai, Kanti R']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Moore JO', 'Boyd TE', 'Larratt LM', 'Skotnicki A', 'Koziner B', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Seymour JF', 'Bociek RG', 'Pavletic S', 'Rai KR']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;, USA. sobrien@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Thionucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.07.1191 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.07.1191 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 20;25(9):1114-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.07.1191.

A small fraction of CD4+ T cells is represented by CD25+ regulatory lymphocytes (Treg), which play a crucial role in modulating peripheral tolerance. To investigate their ability to react to the massive antigenic stimulation generated in an allogeneic host, which could significantly affect their pattern of reconstitution, we analyzed the TCR repertoire of Treg after SCT, focusing on the degree of similarity to CD4+CD25- conventional T cells (Tconv). DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the TCR Vbeta repertoire of Treg in ten patients who had received allogeneic SCT, by using complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratyping. We developed a new similarity score for the analysis. This score expresses the proportion of Vbeta with similar profile between Treg and Tconv. RESULTS: For up to 3 years after SCT the repertoires of Treg and Tconv were characterized by several Vbeta with different profiles between the two cell subsets, while they were extremely similar in patients more than 3 years post-allografting (similarity score= 0.90 vs. 0.61). The differences observed early after SCT were mainly ascribable to Vbeta expressing an oligoclonal profile in Tconv but not in Treg. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the TCR repertoires of Treg and Tconv are significantly different early post-SCT, while they tend to become identical with full reconstitution. This difference could reflect either a discrepancy in the in vivo reactivity against common antigenic stimulations or be the result of different post-transplant ontogeny.","['Fozza, Claudio', 'Nadal, Elisabet', 'Longinotti, Maurizio', 'Dazzi, Francesco']","['Fozza C', 'Nadal E', 'Longinotti M', 'Dazzi F']","['Department of Hematology, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.10774 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Feb;92(2):206-14. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood plasma was analyzed in this study because of previous detection of nucleic acids and proteins from tumor cells in plasma samples. DESIGN AND METHODS: Reverse transcriptase polyemrase chain reaction was used to establish ratios of BCR-ABL:ABL mRNA in peripheral blood cells and plasma, and absolute levels of BCR-ABL mRNA per unit volume of plasma. Samples from 160 CML patients and 180 control individuals without CML were tested. Cells and plasma samples from 93 of the CML patients were re-analyzed 3-12 months after imatinib treatment. RESULTS: Ratios of BCR-ABL:ABL mRNA in paired cell and plasma samples of the 160 CML patients correlated significantly (r=0.83; p<0.001). When results were compared directly using the sign test, the pre-therapy plasma results were significantly different from those from peripheral blood cells (p=0.028), but not bone marrow cells (p=0.119). Absolute levels of BCR-ABL mRNA in plasma strongly correlated with many laboratory characteristics in pre-therapy CML patients. Higher BCR-ABL: ABL ratios were detected in plasma samples at all time points after treatment, although this was significant only at 3 months (p=0.0003). In cases in which results from the assays disagreed, minimal residual disease was detected in plasma samples significantly more frequently than in cell samples (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Plasma was a reliable source for monitoring BCR-ABL mRNA levels. Minimal residual disease detection from plasma was more sensitive than from cell samples. Our results suggest that absolute levels of BCR-ABL mRNA per unit volume of plasma may reflect tumor load.","['Ma, Wanlong', 'Tseng, Richard', 'Gorre, Mercedes', 'Jilani, Iman', 'Keating, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ma W', 'Tseng R', 'Gorre M', 'Jilani I', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute 33608 Ortega Highway, Rm#108B, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690-6130, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/genetics/*therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA/*blood/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.10360 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Feb;92(2):170-5. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CTA genes are expressed in some normal tissues, such as the testis, this immunologically protected site lacks MHC I expression and as such, does not present self antigens to T cells. To date, CTA genes have been shown to be expressed in a range of solid tumors via demethylation of their promoter CpG islands, but rarely in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or other hematologic malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the methylation status of the HAGE CTA gene promoter was analyzed by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and sequencing in four Philadelphia-positive cell lines (TCC-S, K562, KU812 and KYO-1) and in CML samples taken from patients in chronic phase (CP n=215) or blast crisis (BC n=47). HAGE expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The TCC-S cell line showed demethylation of HAGE that was associated with over-expression of this gene. HAGE hypomethylation was significantly more frequent in BC (46%) than in CP (22%) (p=0.01) and was correlated with high expression levels of HAGE transcripts (p<0.0001). Of note, in CP-CML, extensive HAGE hypomethylation was associated with poorer prognosis in terms of cytogenetic response to interferon (p=0.01) or imatinib (p=0.01), molecular response to imatinib (p=0.003) and progression-free survival (p=0.05). INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSION: The methylation status of the HAGE promoter directly correlates with its expression in both CML cell lines and patients and is associated with advanced disease and poor outcome.","['Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Castillejo, Juan A', 'Navarro, German', 'San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Garate, Leire', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Agirre X', 'Castillejo JA', 'Navarro G', 'San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Garate L', 'Cordeu L', 'Cervantes F', 'Prosper F', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A']","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Avda.

Gemcitabine enters the cell mostly via the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1), while drug metabolism occurs by phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II) and cytidine deaminase (CDA) are the main inactivating enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these determinants in gemcitabine cytotoxicity and analyze their expression in lymphoid cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT, and modulated by simultaneous addition of 2'-deoxycytidine (dCK natural substrate), tetrahydrouridine (CDA competitive inhibitor) and diethylpyrocarbonate (cN-II non-competitive inhibitor), while the expression of hENT1, dCK, cN-II, CDA and RR in WIL2-S, Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells as well as in lymphoid cells from 25 chronic lymphocytic B-leukemia (B-CLL) patients was studied with quantitative-PCR. Cell cycle modulation and induction of apoptosis were analyzed by cytofluorimetry and bisbenzimide staining. Gemcitabine was highly cytotoxic, increased the cells in S-phase and significantly enhanced apoptosis. The crucial role of metabolism in gemcitabine activity was confirmed by the significant modulation of cytotoxicity by inhibitors of dCK, CDA and cN-II. Furthermore, PCR demonstrated a correlation between gemcitabine sensitivity and expression of its determinants, and that their values were within those observed in patients. These data indicate that gemcitabine is cytotoxic against lymphoid cells, affecting cell cycle and apoptosis. Furthermore, chemosensitivity may be predicted on the basis of gene expression profile of critical determinants involved in gemcitabine mechanism of action, suggesting the use of pharmacogenetic profiling for treatment optimization.","['Giovannetti, Elisa', 'Mey, Valentina', 'Loni, Lucia', 'Nannizzi, Sara', 'Barsanti, Gemma', 'Savarino, Grazia', 'Ricciardi, Simona', 'Del Tacca, Mario', 'Danesi, Romano']","['Giovannetti E', 'Mey V', 'Loni L', 'Nannizzi S', 'Barsanti G', 'Savarino G', 'Ricciardi S', 'Del Tacca M', 'Danesi R']","['Division of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pisa, 55 Via Roma, 56126 Pisa, Italy. e.giovannetti@med.unipi.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (ribonucleotide reductase M2)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (RRM1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/metabolism"", 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2007/02/14 09:00,2007/08/30 09:00,['2007/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(07)00017-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2007.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2007 Apr;55(4):343-9. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2007.01.003.

(Compositae family) is used as a folk medicine in anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and other medications in Asia. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of ethanol extracts of Lactuca indica L. (EEL) on human leukemic HL-60 cell lines and its active components. The results showed that EEL exhibited strong cytotoxic effects against HL-60 cells; the IC50 value was 313 microg/mL. Flow cytometric analysis of the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) using the annexin V/PI method on EEL-treated HL-60 cells showed a concentration-dependent increase of apoptosis. Moreover, EEL could induce typical DNA fragmentation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as determined by electrophoresis and TUNEL assays. The treatment of HL-60 cells with EEL induced significant accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase, indicating that EEL is a cell-cycle-dependent anticancer agent. Our results also indicate that EEL-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m).

Imatinib (STI571) is a highly selective inhibitor of BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase used in leukemia treatment. It has been suggested that BCR/ABL may contribute to the resistance of leukemic cells to drug and radiation through stimulation of DNA repair in these cells. To evaluate further the influence of STI571 on DNA repair we studied the efficacy of this process in BCR/ABL-positive and -negative cells using single cell electrophoresis (comet assay). In our experiments, K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells expressing BCR/ABL and CCRF-CEM human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells without BCR/ABL expression were employed. The cells were exposed for 1 h at 37 degrees C to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) at 5 microM, mitomycin C (MMC) at 50 microM or to gamma-radiation at 15 Gy with or without a 24 h preincubation at 1 microM of STI571. The MTT cells survival after 4 days of culture showed that STI571 enhanced the cytotoxity of the examined compounds in the K562 line. Further it was found, that the inhibitor decreased the efficacy of DNA repair challenged by each agent, but only in the K562 expressing BCR/ABL. Due to the variety of DNA damage induced by the employed agents in this study we can speculate, that BCR/ABL may stimulate multiple pathways of DNA repair. These results extend our previous studies performed on BCR/ABL-transformed mouse cells onto human cells. It is shown that BCR/ABL stimulated DNA repair in human leukemia cells. In conclusion we report that STI571 was found to inhibit DNA repair and abrogate BCR/ABL-positive human leukemia cells therapeutic resistance.","['Majsterek, Ireneusz', 'Arabski, Michal', 'Czechowska, Agnieszka', 'Pytel, Dariusz', 'Morawiec, Zbigniew', 'Morawiec-Bajda, Alina', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Majsterek I', 'Arabski M', 'Czechowska A', 'Pytel D', 'Morawiec Z', 'Morawiec-Bajda A', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland. imajst@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

The concentration of chromate for 50% survival of bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) during a 24-h incubation was (22 +/- 4) microM. The cytotoxicity was partly prevented by desferrioxamine, the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine and by an inhibitor of NQO1, dicumarol, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), which inactivates GR. The NADPH-dependent chromate reduction by digitonin-permeabilized FLK cells was partly inhibited by dicumarol and not affected by BCNU. Taken together, these data indicate that the oxidative stress-type cytotoxicity of chromate in FLK cells may be partly attributed to its reduction by NQO1, but not by GR. The effect of BCNU on the chromate cytotoxicity may indicate that the general antioxidant action of reduced glutathione is more important than its prooxidant activities arising from the reactions with chromate.","['Nivinskas, Henrikas', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Maroziene, Audrone', 'Normantiene, Terese', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Nivinskas H', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Maroziene A', 'Normantiene T', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Mokslininku 12, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Imatinib, the first TKI to be approved for the treatment of CML and the current standard first-line therapy, has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with CML. Nevertheless, a minority of patients in chronic-phase CML and even more patients with advanced-phase disease demonstrate resistance to imatinib or develop resistance during treatment. In 40% to 50% of cases, this is attributed to the development of mutations that impair the ability of imatinib to bind to and inhibit the constitutively active Bcr-Abl kinase. Consequently, researchers have developed novel, more potent TKIs that can overcome not only Bcr-Abl-dependent mechanisms of resistance, but also those that are Bcr-Abl-independent. These include: dasatinib, a potent dual Bcr-Abl and Src inhibitor; nilotinib, a selective, potent Bcr-Abl inhibitor; bosutinib (SKI-606) and INNO-406 (NS-187), which are both Src-Abl inhibitors; and others. Combination therapy is also being explored concurrently using agents that affect a variety of oncogenic pathways and immune modulation. Herein, we review some of these strategies, particularly those for which clinical data are currently available.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (TOM1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'NVW4Z03I9B (bafetinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2007/02/13 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/02/13 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(06)00256-3 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2007 Jan;44(1 Suppl 1):S25-31. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.12.003.,,,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients, primarily those with advanced disease, are either initially refractory to imatinib or eventually develop imatinib resistance. Imatinib resistance or intolerance frequently depends on the re-emergence of Bcr-Abl kinase activity, but can also indicate Bcr-Abl-independent disease progression. Results from phase II/III trials suggest rates of resistance and relapse correlate with stage of disease and with the monitoring parameters: hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses. To date, more than 40 different point mutations that code for distinct single amino acid substitutions in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain have been isolated from imatinib-resistant patients. These mutations affect amino acids involved in imatinib binding or in regulatory regions of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, resulting in decreased sensitivity to imatinib while retaining aberrant kinase activity. Early mutation detection may aid in risk stratification and molecular-based treatment decisions. To overcome imatinib-resistant disease, novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors with activity against imatinib-resistant mutations and/or with inhibition of alternative pathways, such as Src activation, have recently been developed. Additional strategies include imatinib dose escalation, combination therapy, and treatment interruption to stop clonal selection of resistant cells.","['Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Mueller, Martin C']","['Hochhaus A', 'Erben P', 'Ernst T', 'Mueller MC']","['III.

The hallmark of CML is the presence of a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), which is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. This translocation results in the formation of the bcr-abl fusion gene, which, in turn, is translated into a chimeric Bcr-Abl protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Constitutive Bcr-Abl expression has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the transformed phenotype of CML cells. CML is unique among human cancers in that a single genetic defect, the Ph chromosome, is responsible for the transformed phenotype. Since this discovery more than 40 years ago, our understanding of the clinical course, therapy, and prognosis of patients with CML has changed significantly. These changes have culminated in the emergence of imatinib, the first rationally designed, molecularly targeted therapy for human malignancy.

Encapsidation of ODNs in a drug-delivery capsule would reduce such degradation, thereby increasing the potency of therapy. MS2 bacteriophage capsid proteins may be used as novel virus-like particles (VLPs) to deliver ODNs. Here we report an analysis of the uptake mechanism of this VLP system and preliminary examples of its use to deliver a number of ODNs, including some targeting p120 messenger RNAs, a biomarker overexpressed in myelogenous leukemia cells. METHODS: The ODNs were synthesized as covalent extensions to the translational repressor/assembly initiation signal (TR), a 19 nt stem-loop, of the RNA phage MS2. The VLPs were constructed by soaking ODN-TR directly into recombinant RNA-free capsid shells. Targeting of the encapsidated ODNs into cells was achieved by a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway identified by immunofluorescence microscopy or by transmission electron microscopy with gold-labeled antibodies. RESULTS: After covalent decoration with transferrin on their surface, the VLPs containing ODNs demonstrated increased effectiveness in killing target leukemia cells expressing transferrin receptors, suggesting that this system is worthy of more extensive analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that RNA phage VLPs may be useful as a new nanomaterial for targeted delivery of antisense ODNs, or other macromolecular drug candidates.","['Wu, Min', 'Sherwin, Trevor', 'Brown, William L', 'Stockley, Peter G']","['Wu M', 'Sherwin T', 'Brown WL', 'Stockley PG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nanomedicine,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",101233142,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Capsid/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Gene Targeting/methods', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/genetics/*pharmacokinetics', 'RNA Phages/*metabolism']",2007/02/13 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2007/02/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1549-9634(05)00014-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nano.2004.11.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Nanomedicine. 2005 Mar;1(1):67-76. doi: 10.1016/j.nano.2004.11.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We sought to study molecular determinants of effector cell degranulation using a monoclonal IgE antibody specific for a peptide epitope of one of the most important respiratory allergens, the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 1, as a model system. METHODS: A hybridoma cell line producing a monoclonal IgE antibody against a Phl p 1-derived peptide, P1, was established by means of immunization of mice and used to sensitize rat basophil leukemia cells, which were exposed to P1 monomer, P1 dimer, and P1 polymer. RESULTS: It is demonstrated that the number of IgE epitopes on an allergen molecule and the concentration of allergen-specific IgE antibodies determine the extent of degranulation. The P1 monomer did not cause mediator release and prevented degranulation induced by polymeric P1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the number of IgE epitopes on an allergen molecule determines its allergenic activity and explains why increases of allergen-specific IgE levels make patients more sensitive to allergens. Allergen-derived monomeric structures isolated by means of combinatorial chemistry might be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for allergy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study reveals molecular factors that determine the immediate allergenic activity of allergens and hence influence clinical sensitivity to these allergens.","['Gieras, Anna', 'Focke-Tejkl, Margarete', 'Ball, Tanja', 'Verdino, Petra', 'Hartl, Arnulf', 'Thalhamer, Josef', 'Valenta, Rudolf']","['Gieras A', 'Focke-Tejkl M', 'Ball T', 'Verdino P', 'Hartl A', 'Thalhamer J', 'Valenta R']","['Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Research, Division of Immunopathology, Department of Pathophysiology, Center for Physiology and Pathophysiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '160227-82-7 (PHLPI protein, Phleum pratense)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins/*immunology', 'Rats']",2007/02/13 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/02/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-6749(06)02009-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2006.09.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007 Feb;119(2):384-90. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2006.09.034.

Interestingly, co-treatment with etoposide potentiated apoptosis. Further analysis of matrine-induced apoptotic changes revealed that E2F-1 and Apaf-1 were upregulated, whereas Rb was downregulated after 24 h of exposure. This was followed by Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 and -3 activation. These results demonstrate that matrine triggers apoptosis of K562 cells primarily through the mitochondrial pathway and that matrine is a potential anti-tumor drug.","['Jiang, Hua', 'Hou, ChunHui', 'Zhang, ShuBing', 'Xie, HengYue', 'Zhou, WeiYing', 'Jin, QiHuang', 'Cheng, XiaoDong', 'Qian, RuoLan', 'Zhang, XueJun']","['Jiang H', 'Hou C', 'Zhang S', 'Xie H', 'Zhou W', 'Jin Q', 'Cheng X', 'Qian R', 'Zhang X']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 YueYang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Quinolizines/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/02/13 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/02/13 09:00'],"['2006/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(07)00004-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.12.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2007 Mar 22;559(2-3):98-108. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.12.017.

Inside this system, T lymphocytes are particular for several reasons. First and foremost, their differentiation takes place in a different organ from the one where the immature progenitors are generated and expanded. This implies the migration of an immature progenitor from the fetal liver and later on from the bone marrow to the thymus. Secondly, T cell differentiation is characterized by thymic selection and generation of T lymphocytes with a diverse repertoire able to answer to all foreign antigens one can meet. These complicated mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation, completely different from those characterizing the myeloid system, at least partially explain our limited knowledge on human T cell lymphopoiesis. Finally, T cell differentiation pathway shows the particularity of profound ontogenic changes with the huge production of lymphoid progenitors during the fetal and the first years of life which declines during the ageing period. Recently, the discovery of new hematopoietic cytokines, the discovery of genes involved in primary immunodeficiencies and the detailed description of the role of Notch receptors have strongly developed our knowledge on T cell lymphopoiesis. In this review, we will attempt to describe where we stand in the description of this fundamental process and to underline the unresolved questions.

From first diagnosis, families are encouraged by healthcare professionals (following government guidelines) to try to maintain a normal life. The aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of how 'normal' family life is compromised from the perspective of the families themselves during this period of extreme stress and concern for the health and well-being of their child. METHODS: This study was longitudinal and involved a cross section of 32 mothers of children recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) currently participating in the Medical Research Council ALL-97 randomized control trial. Mothers were interviewed at three time points (3-4 months post diagnosis, 15 and 27 months) using a semi-structured format with open-ended questions. A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse interview data using Thematic analysis. RESULTS: Mothers reported understanding the importance of achieving normal life, but described how this was difficult to realize. At first interview, mothers were optimistic that they could achieve the 'normal life' as advised by healthcare workers. At 12 and 24 months, although all mothers reported that life was not back to normal, there were differences in how they perceived this lack of normality. Whereas some families experienced frustration and disappointment, others had adjusted and managed to accept the new order. CONCLUSIONS: Families felt encouraged on diagnosis to be told that despite the severity of the disease and treatment regime, a normal life was possible and should be pursued. Our findings indicate that over time, more concrete information is needed to guide parents through the treatment process in order to help them achieve this.","['Earle, E A', 'Clarke, S A', 'Eiser, C', 'Sheppard, L']","['Earle EA', 'Clarke SA', 'Eiser C', 'Sheppard L']","['Child and Family Research Group, Department of Psychology, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Family', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2007/02/13 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2007/02/13 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['CCH638 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00638.x [doi]']",ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2007 Mar;33(2):155-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00638.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While amitosine induced caspase-3 activation in MT-4 cells, the increase in the number of cells containing the active caspase-3 did not correlate with the increase of apoptotic cell percentage.

NF-kappaB regulates the transcriptional of genes important for tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, an inhibition of NF-kappaB, has been used conventionally to treat migraines and inflammation. In this study, renal cancer cell lines OUR-10 and ACHN were used for in vitro experiments to evaluate growth-inhibitory effects of parthenolide. An OUR-10 xenograft model in nude mice was also used to investigate the in vivo growth-inhibitory effects of parthenolide. Apoptosis in response to treatment of OUR-10 cells with parthenolide was confirmed. Localization of NF-kappaB in response to parthenolide treatment was examined of by immunofluorostaining of OUR-10 cells with antibody against NF-kappaB p65 and by Western blot analysis of OUR-10 cell and tumor nuclear and cytosol fraction. Parthenolide effectively inhibited proliferation of cultured OUR-10 cells and triggered apoptosis in vitro. Subcutaneous injection or oral administration of parthenolide showed significant tumor growth inhibition in the xenograft model via decreased production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed decreased nuclear localization of NF-kappaB and phosphorylated NF-kappaB protein and subsequently expression of MMP-9, Bcl-xL and Cox-2 in response to parthenolide treatment. These results indicate that parthenolide is a useful in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and acts via inhibition of NF-kappaB.","['Oka, Daizo', 'Nishimura, Kazuo', 'Shiba, Masahiro', 'Nakai, Yasutomo', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Nakayama, Masashi', 'Takayama, Hitoshi', 'Inoue, Hitoshi', 'Okuyama, Akihiko', 'Nonomura, Norio']","['Oka D', 'Nishimura K', 'Shiba M', 'Nakai Y', 'Arai Y', 'Nakayama M', 'Takayama H', 'Inoue H', 'Okuyama A', 'Nonomura N']","['Department of Urology, Osaka University, Graduate School of Medicine, Suita-city, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-8/analysis', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22570 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Jun 15;120(12):2576-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the classical NSAIDs sulindac and aspirin are promising chemopreventive agents against colon cancer. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenases (COX) preventing the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane. NSAIDs also exert other biological effects, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of NF-kappaB-mediated signals. Despite many suggested mechanisms for their anticancer effects, it remains uncertain how they induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Furthermore, there is little information on the selectivity of NSAIDs-mediated anticancer effects, although this is one of the most important issues in cancer therapy. Increased understanding of the biological basis for the anticancer activity of NSAIDs and their selectivity is essential for future therapeutic advances. In this paper, we propose that increased ROS generation is one of the key mechanisms for NSAIDs-mediated anticancer effects on various cancer cells.","['Adachi, M', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Kawamura, R', 'Wang, W', 'Imai, K', 'Shinomura, Y']","['Adachi M', 'Sakamoto H', 'Kawamura R', 'Wang W', 'Imai K', 'Shinomura Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan. adachi@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemoprevention', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Sulindac/pharmacology']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-22.437 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2007 Apr;22(4):437-42. doi: 10.14670/HH-22.437.,,,,,,,43,,,,,10.14670/HH-22.437 [doi],,,,,,

Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles.

We evaluated incidence and risk factors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment for low- and high-risk HD with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and etoposide (ABVE) or dose-intensified ABVE with prednisone and cyclophosphamide (ABVE-PC), respectively, was followed by low-dose radiation. The number of chemotherapy cycles was determined by rapidity of the initial response. Patients were assigned randomly to receive DRZ (n = 239) or no DRZ (n = 239) concomitantly with chemotherapy to evaluate its potential to decrease adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients developed SMN. Six of eight patients developed AML/MDS, and both solid tumors (osteosarcoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma) occurred in recipients of DRZ. Eight patients with SMN were first events. With median 58 months' follow-up, 4-year cumulative incidence rate (CIR) for AML/MDS was 2.55% +/- 1.0% with DRZ versus 0.85% +/- 0.6% in the non-DRZ group (P = .160). For any SMN, the CIR for DRZ was 3.43% +/- 1.2% versus CIR for non-DRZ of 0.85% +/- 0.6% (P = .060). Among patients receiving DRZ, the standardized incidence rate (SIR) for AML/MDS was 613.6 compared with 202.4 for those not receiving DRZ (P = .0990). The SIR for all SMN was 41.86 with DRZ versus 10.08 without DRZ (P = .0231). CONCLUSION: DRZ is a topoisomerase II inhibitor with a mechanism distinct from etoposide and doxorubicin. Adding DRZ to ABVE and ABVE-PC may have increased the incidence of SMN and AML/MDS.","['Tebbi, Cameron K', 'London, Wendy B', 'Friedman, Debra', 'Villaluna, Doojduen', 'De Alarcon, Pedro A', 'Constine, Louis S', 'Mendenhall, Nancy Price', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Chauvenet, Allen', 'Schwartz, Cindy L']","['Tebbi CK', 'London WB', 'Friedman D', 'Villaluna D', 'De Alarcon PA', 'Constine LS', 'Mendenhall NP', 'Sposto R', 'Chauvenet A', 'Schwartz CL']","[""Children's Oncology Group, Statistics and Data Center, Arcadia, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Chelating Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Osteosarcoma/chemically induced', 'Razoxane/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/5/493 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.3879 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 10;25(5):493-500. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.3879.,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jul 20;25(21):3179; author reply 3180.

Pharmacological NR ligands serve as important therapeutic agents; for example, all-trans retinoic acid, an activating ligand for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), is used to treat leukemia. Another RARalpha ligand, (E)-S,S-dioxide-4-(2-(7-(heptyloxy)-3,4-dihydro-4,4-dimethyl-2H-1-benzothiopyran- 6-yl)-1-propenyl)-benzoic acid (Ro 41-5253), is a potent antagonist that has been a useful and purportedly specific probe of RARalpha function. Here, we report that Ro 41-5253 also activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and target of widely prescribed antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Ro 41-5253 enhanced differentiation of mouse and human preadipocytes and activated PPARgamma target genes in mature adipocytes. Like the TZDs, Ro 41-5253 also down-regulated PPARgamma protein expression in adipocytes. In addition, Ro 41-5253 activated the PPARgamma-ligand binding domain in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. These effects were not prevented by a potent RARalpha agonist or by depleting cells of RARalpha, indicating that PPARgamma activation was not related to RARalpha antagonism. Indeed, Ro 41-5253 was able to compete with TZD ligands for binding to PPARgamma, suggesting that Ro 41-5253 directly affects PPAR activity.

Cytotoxic T cells recognizing survivin epitopes can be elicited in vitro and by vaccination in patients with leukemia, breast cancer, and melanoma. We did this study to investigate whether survivin-specific CD8+ T cells occur in patients with multiple myeloma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An HLA-A2.1-binding survivin peptide was used to detect peptide-specific T cells by a quantitative real-time PCR to measure antigen-specific IFN-gamma mRNA expression in 23 patients with myeloma and 21 healthy volunteers. T cells producing IFN-gamma in response to survivin were further analyzed for expression of CD45RA and CCR7 to determine phenotypic characterization. Additional immunohistochemical analyses of survivin antigen expression in bone marrow specimens of patients was done. RESULTS: T cells recognizing HLA-A2.1-binding survivin peptide were detected in 9 of 23 patients and in 1 of 21 healthy volunteers. Survivin-reactive T cells were identified as terminally differentiated effector T cells (CD8+, CD45RA+, and CCR7-). Positive survivin expression of myeloma cells in bone marrow specimens was shown in 7 of 11 patients. CONCLUSION: We provide, for the first time, evidence of T cell reactivity against survivin antigen in patients with multiple myeloma.

However, the clinical and biological significances of CK2 have not been elucidated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the biological significances of catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2alpha) expression in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic blasts obtained from AML patients. RESULTS: In this study, the expression of CK2alpha was elevated in a substantial proportion of AML. In AML patients with normal karyotype, the disease-free survival and overall survival rates were significantly lower in the CK2alpha-high compared with the CK2alpha-low AML cases (P=0.0252 and P=0.0392, respectively). An induced overexpression of CK2alpha increased the levels of Ser473 phosphorylated (p)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), p-PDK1, pFKHR, p-BAD, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and XIAP. Treatment of U937 cell line and primary AML blasts with selective CK2 inhibitor, tetrabromobenzotriazole or apigenin, reduced the levels of these molecules in a dose-dependent manner. CK2alpha small interfering RNA treatment also resulted in a down-regulation of p-Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 in U937 cells. Apigenin-induced cell death was preferentially observed in the CK2alpha-high leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and NB4, which was accompanied by cytoplasmic release of SMAC/DIABLO and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9, procaspase-3, procaspase-8, and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. An induced overexpression of CK2alpha potentially enhanced the sensitivity of U937 cells to the apigenin-induced cell death. Apigenin-induced cell death was significantly higher in CK2alpha-high AML compared with CK2alpha-low AML (P<0.0001) or normal bone marrow samples (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These findings strongly suggest protein kinase CK2alpha as an unfavorable prognostic marker and novel therapeutic target in AML.","['Kim, Jin Seok', 'Eom, Ju In', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Choi, Ae Jin', 'Lee, Jin Koo', 'Yang, Woo Ick', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Kim JS', 'Eom JI', 'Cheong JW', 'Choi AJ', 'Lee JK', 'Yang WI', 'Min YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Brain Korea 21 Research Team of Nanobiomaterials for the Cell-Based Implants, Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/pharmacology', 'Casein Kinase II/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/3/1019 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1602 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;13(3):1019-28. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Events causing chromosomal abnormalities in ESCs may be related to events in tumor cells causing chromosomal instability (CIN) in human disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using multiparametric permeabilized-cell flow cytometric analysis, we found that the mitotic-spindle checkpoint, which helps maintain chromosomal integrity during all cell divisions, functions in human and mouse ESCs, but does not initiate apoptosis as it does in somatic cells. This allows an unusual tolerance to polyploidy resulting from failed mitosis, which is common in rapidly proliferating cell populations and which is reduced to near-diploid aneuploidy, which is also common in human neoplastic disease. Checkpoint activation in ESC-derived early-differentiated cells results in robust apoptosis without polyploidy/aneuploidy similar to that in somatic cells. Thus, the spindle checkpoint is ""uncoupled"" from apoptosis in ESCs and is a likely source of karyotypic abnormalities. This natural behavior of ESCs to tolerate/survive varying degrees of ploidy change could complicate genome-reprogramming studies and stem-cell plasticity studies, but could also reveal clues about the mechanisms of CIN in human tumors.","['Mantel, Charlie', 'Guo, Ying', 'Lee, Man Ryul', 'Kim, Min-Kyoung', 'Han, Myung-Kwan', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Fukuda, Seiji', 'Yoder, Mervin C', 'Pelus, Louis M', 'Kim, Kye-Seong', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E']","['Mantel C', 'Guo Y', 'Lee MR', 'Kim MK', 'Han MK', 'Shibayama H', 'Fukuda S', 'Yoder MC', 'Pelus LM', 'Kim KS', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, and the Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. cmantel@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Instability/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Polyploidy', 'Spindle Apparatus/metabolism']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41579-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-10-054247 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4518-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-054247.

A major limitation is that, even during short-term storage of native specimens of peripheral blood or bone marrow (BM) and/or RNA isolation, significant changes of gene expression pattern can occur because of gene induction, repression, and RNA degradation. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed RNA stabilization and preparation system for BM specimens (PAXgene Bone Marrow RNA System) over time. We analyzed 256 RNA samples, processed from 64 BM specimens. RESULTS: Although the overall RNA yield (normalized to 1 x 10(7) leukocytes) was not different, the RNA preparation using unstabilized reference samples had an approximately 3 times higher failure rate. With the PAXgene system, we observed significantly higher RNA integrity compared with the reference RNA preparation system (P <0.01). In the stabilized samples, we found very high pairwise correlation in gene expression (DeltaDeltaC(T) 0.16-0.53) for the analyzed genes (GATA1, RUNX1, NCAM1, and SPI1) after 48-h storage compared with immediate preparation of RNA (2 h after BM collection). However, we found major differences in half of the analyzed genes using the reference RNA isolation procedure (DeltaDeltaC(T) 1.07 and 1.32). CONCLUSIONS: The PAXgene system is able to stabilize RNA from clinical BM samples and is suitable to isolate high-quality and -quantity RNA.","['Langebrake, Claudia', 'Gunther, Kalle', 'Lauber, Jurgen', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Langebrake C', 'Gunther K', 'Lauber J', 'Reinhardt D']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. claudia@langebrake.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/standards', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Specimen Handling', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",2007/02/10 09:00,2007/05/22 09:00,['2007/02/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2006.078592 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2006.078592 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2007 Apr;53(4):587-93. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2006.078592.

As the limits of optimizing the use of old drugs are reached, most adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia still succumb to their disease and leukemia remains the leading cause of nonaccidental death in children. Salvage regimens, based mostly on different combinations of the same agents used in front-line therapy, carry a high incidence of morbidity and dismal long-term survival rates. New therapeutic strategies are needed. Clofarabine, a next-generation deoxyadenosine analog, has demonstrated significant activity in children and adults with refractory lymphoid and myeloid leukemia in early clinical trials and was granted approval for use in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second or higher relapse. This is the only anticancer drug to receive primary indication for use in children over the past decade.

We aimed to identify and solve potential problems in multicenter MRD studies to achieve and maintain consistent results between the AIEOP/BFM ALL-2000 MRD laboratories. As the dot-blot hybridization method was replaced by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) method during the treatment protocol, special attention was given to the comparison of MRD data obtained by both methods and to the reproducibility of RQ-PCR data. Evaluation of all key steps in molecular MRD diagnostics identified several pitfalls that resulted in discordant MRD results. In particular, guidelines for RQ-PCR data interpretation appeared to be crucial for obtaining concordant MRD results. The experimental variation of the RQ-PCR was generally less than three-fold, but logically became larger at low MRD levels below the reproducible sensitivity of the assay (<10(-4)). Finally, MRD data obtained by dot-blot hybridization were comparable to those obtained by RQ-PCR analysis (r(2)=0.74). In conclusion, MRD diagnostics using RQ-PCR analysis of immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements is feasible in multicenter studies but requires standardization; particularly strict guidelines for interpretation of RQ-PCR data are required.

We studied the clinical and biological characteristics in 32 consecutively diagnosed childhood cases (median age 10.0 years, range 1.0-17.1 years). Immunophenotyping revealed a pro-B and a pre-B stage in 24 and eight cases, respectively. IGH genes were rearranged in 84% of leukemias with a predominance of incomplete DJ(H) joints. Whereas IGK-Kde and TCRD rearrangements were rare, TCRG rearrangements were present in 50% of cases and involved mainly Vgamma11 or Vgamma9 together with a Jgamma1.3./2.3 gene segment, an unusual combination among t(4;11)-negative B-cell precursor ALL. Oligoclonality was found in about 30% as assessed by heterogeneous IGH and TCRG rearrangements.

Most of the increased c-myc expression is from the P1 promoter, which is normally a minor promoter. How the P1 promoter is activated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers is not understood. We identified a YY1 site in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene HS3 enhancer, which increased c-myc P1 promoter activity, and a MARE site, which decreased c-myc P1 activity. Small Maf proteins bound to the MARE site both in vitro and in vivo, recruited histone deacetylase 2, and resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the c-myc promoter region. In contrast, YY1 recruited CBP and increased histone acetylation at the c-myc promoter. Rb interacts with YY1 to prevent DNA binding in normal B cells, but no significant interaction with YY1 was detected in Burkitt's cells, and binding of YY1 to the HS3 enhancer was observed by chromatin immunoprecipitaton. Increased expression of MafK and/or decreased expression of YY1 by silencing RNA downregulated endogenous c-myc mRNA levels and increased the sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin. Mutation of the major active sites (nuclear factor-kappa B and YY1) in the enhancers prevented c-myc activation.","['Hu, H-M', 'Kanda, K', 'Zhang, L', 'Boxer, L M']","['Hu HM', 'Kanda K', 'Zhang L', 'Boxer LM']","['Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148770-78-9 (HIVEP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404583 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404583 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):747-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404583.

To characterize the molecular modifications induced by HTLV-I infection, we compared HTLV-I-infected WE17/10 cells with control cells, using micro-arrays. Many calcium-related genes were progressively downmodulated over a period of 2 years. Infected cells acquired a profound decrease of intracellular calcium levels in response to ionomycin, timely correlated with decreased CD7 expression. Focusing on apoptosis-related genes and their relationship with CD7, we observed an underexpression of most antiapoptotic genes. Western blotting revealed increasing Akt and Bad phosphorylation, timely correlated with CD7 loss. This was shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent. Activation of PI3K/Akt induced resistance to the apoptotic effect of interleukin-2 deprivation. We thus propose the following model: HTLV-I infection induces a progressive decrease in CD3 genes expression, which eventually abrogates CD3 expression; loss of CD3 is known to perturb calcium transport. This perturbation correlates with loss of CD7 expression and induction of Akt and Bad phosphorylation via activation of PI3K. The activation of the Akt/Bad pathway generates a progressive resistance to apoptosis, at a time HTLV-I genes expression is silenced, thus avoiding immune surveillance. This could be a major event in the process of the malignant transformation into ATLL.","['Akl, H', 'Badran, B M', 'Zein, N El', 'Bex, F', 'Sotiriou, C', 'Willard-Gallo, K E', 'Burny, A', 'Martiat, P']","['Akl H', 'Badran BM', 'Zein NE', 'Bex F', 'Sotiriou C', 'Willard-Gallo KE', 'Burny A', 'Martiat P']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Bordet Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD7/*genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*genetics/physiology']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404585 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404585 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):788-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404585.

Paired CD38(+) and CD38(-) CLL cells derived from the same patient were shown to be monoclonal by V(H) gene sequencing but despite this, CD38(+) CLL cells possessed a distinct gene expression profile when compared with their CD38(-) sub-clones. Importantly, CD38(+) CLL cells relatively over expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and appeared to preferentially utilize an internal autocrine VEGF survival loop. Elevated VEGF expression was associated with increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling also resulted in a reduction in cell viability. In contrast, exogenous VEGF caused a significant increase in CD38(-) CLL cell viability and a marked induction of Mcl-1; both effects were less obvious in CD38(+) CLL cells.

Newly diagnosed 36 patients with acute leukemia (14 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 22 acute myeloblastic leukemia) and gender- and age-matched 32 healthy subjects as controls were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of leukemia was established by whole blood count, peripheral smears and bone marrow aspirations. In order to rule out the effect of any medication on HRV, the patients were selected from those who had not received any antineoplastic agent yet. For assessing the cardiac autonomic functions, HRV obtained from 24-hr Holter monitor recordings was used. The age, gender and serum ferritin levels were similar, while hemoglobin levels were lower in the leukemia group. The comparison of the leukemia group and control group revealed that HRV decreased in patients with acute leukemia, which reflects sympathetic dominance in acute leukemia. This is the first study that shows altered cardiac autonomic functions in patients with acute leukemias who are not on any therapeutical intervention.

The effects of stem cell transplant (SCT) status, underlying disease, age, sex, ethnicity, and antibody status (prior to CMV exposure) on the incidence of CMV antigenemia were determined; and the CMV burdens were quantified. Antigenemia occurred in 9.3% of patients with non-SCT (n = 2511), 12.0% with autologous SCT (n = 582), and 39.1% with allogeneic SCT (n = 1289). Non-SCT patients with lymphoid tumors had a significantly higher rate of antigenemia than those with myeloid tumors (13.6% versus 3.9%) (P < 0.001); however, after allogeneic SCT, the underlying diseases had little effect, except for multiple myeloma (56.8%) (P = 0.014). Among the allogeneic SCT recipients, higher CMV antigenemia rates were also associated with female sex, older age, and positivity for pre-SCT CMV antibody. Depending on the underlying disease and its associated initial CMV risk, allogeneic SCT increased the risk by 2.6- to 29.6-fold (overall, 4.0-fold). With or without SCT, Asians had the highest CMV antigenemia rates and burdens, followed by blacks, Hispanics, and whites, and these partially correlated with antibody prevalence. Among the 808 patients with antigenemia, the circulating peak CMV burden was significantly higher among non-SCT patients (geometric mean, 18.7 positive cells per 10(6) leukocytes) than among allogeneic SCT patients (geometric mean, 7.7 positive cells per 10(6) leukocytes) or autologous SCT patients (geometric mean, 7.0 positive cells per 10(6) leukocytes) who underwent monitoring for CMV.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The in vitro cytotoxities of chimmitecan in human tumor cell lines and multidrug resistance (MDR) cells were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and sulforhodamin B assays. DNA relaxation, cleavage assays, and cellular band depletion assay were combined to delineate its effects on topoisomerase I. DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis were assessed using comet assay, flow cytometry, and DNA ladder analysis, respectively. The in vivo antitumor activities were measured in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Chimmitecan displayed more potent cytotoxicity than SN38 and topotecan. Neither a cross-resistance to chimmitecan in MDR cells nor an influence of human serum albumin in its cytotoxity was observed. Chimmitecan exhibited comparable effects on topoisomerase I compared with the reference drugs, including inhibiting topoisomerase I catalytic activity and trapping and stabilizing covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. Furthermore, nanomolar levels of chimmitecan caused impressive DNA damage, G(2)-M phase arrest, and apoptosis in human leukemia HL60 cells. I.v. administration of chimmitecan inhibited the growth of HCT-116, MDA-MB-435, BEL-7402, and A549 human carcinoma xenografts in nude mice, with greater potency than CPT-11 against the latter two tumors models. Chimmitecan presented potent efficacy in A549 tumor model when given orally. CONCLUSIONS: Chimmitecan is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I and displays outstanding activity in vitro and in vivo. The substitution at the 9-position benefits chimmitecan a salient anti-MDR activity, stability in human serum albumin, improved solubility, and oral availability, which might favorably promise its therapeutic potential in clinical settings.","['Huang, Min', 'Gao, Heyong', 'Chen, Yi', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Cai, Yujun', 'Zhang, Xiongwen', 'Miao, Zehong', 'Jiang, Hualiang', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Shen, Hongwu', 'Lin, Liping', 'Lu, Wei', 'Ding, Jian']","['Huang M', 'Gao H', 'Chen Y', 'Zhu H', 'Cai Y', 'Zhang X', 'Miao Z', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang J', 'Shen H', 'Lin L', 'Lu W', 'Ding J']","['Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '889O97XDAD (chimmitecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Molecular', 'Topotecan/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-06-1277 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1277 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 15;13(4):1298-307. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1277.

These normally punctate structures are reorganized by E4 ORF3 into tracks that eventually surround viral replication centers. PML rearrangement is an evolutionarily conserved function of E4 ORF3, yet its cause and functional relevance remain mysteries. The E4 ORF3 protein coimmunoprecipitates with the PML protein, yet E4 ORF3 still forms tracks in cells that lack PML. The PML protein is a member of a larger protein family termed tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins. TRIM proteins contain a tripartite domain structure in proximity to their N termini that consists of a RING finger domain, followed by one or two B box domains and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (collectively termed the RBCC domain). The order and spacing of these domains are evolutionarily conserved and thought to mediate protein-protein interactions and other functions. We implemented a proteomic approach to isolate cellular proteins that bind to E4 ORF3. We identified a novel interaction between E4 ORF3 and another TRIM family member, transcriptional intermediary factor 1 alpha (TIF1alpha). TIF1alpha functions by recruiting coactivators and/or corepressors to modulate transcription. The interaction between E4 ORF3 and TIF1alpha was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and binding of recombinant proteins. Indirect immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that TIF1alpha is reorganized into track structures that contain PML upon E4 ORF3 expression. The RBCC domain of TIF1alpha is sufficient for E4 ORF3-induced rearrangement, and TIF1alpha reorganization is conserved across adenovirus serotypes.","['Yondola, Mark A', 'Hearing, Patrick']","['Yondola MA', 'Hearing P']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcriptional intermediary factor 1)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/05/19 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02629-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02629-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Apr;81(8):4264-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02629-06.

Earlier work indicated that a post-entry step in the infectious cycle accounted for the poor cell-free infectivity of HTLV-1. To determine whether variations in the pol gene sequence correlated with virus infectivity, we sequenced and phenotypically tested pol genes from a variety of HTLV-1 isolates derived from primary sources, transformed cell lines, and molecular clones. The pol genes and deduced amino acid sequences from 23 proviruses were sequenced and compared with 14 previously published sequences, revealing a limited number of amino acid variations among isolates. The variations appeared to be randomly dispersed among primary isolates and proviruses from cell lines and molecular clones. In addition, there was no correlation between reverse transcriptase sequence and the disease phenotype of the original source of the virus isolate. HTLV-1 pol gene fragments encoding reverse transcriptase were amplified from a variety of isolates and were subcloned into HTLV-1 vectors for both single-cycle infection and spreading-infection assays. Vectors carrying pol genes that matched the consensus sequence had the highest titers, and those with the largest number of variations from the consensus had the lowest titers. The molecular clone from CS-1 cells had four amino acid differences from the consensus sequence and yielded infectious titers that were approximately eight times lower than those of vectors encoding a consensus reverse transcriptase.","['Mitchell, Michael S', 'Bodine, Ellen T', 'Hill, Shawn', 'Princler, Gerald', 'Lloyd, Patricia', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Derse, David']","['Mitchell MS', 'Bodine ET', 'Hill S', 'Princler G', 'Lloyd P', 'Mitsuya H', 'Matsuoka M', 'Derse D']","['National Cancer Institute, Bldg. 535/134, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Genes, pol/genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/enzymology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02660-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02660-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 May;81(9):4422-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02660-06.

In this study, we observed that during this period, the viral envelope precursor polyprotein accumulated to high levels in thymic lymphocytes from mice inoculated with virus. Envelope accumulation occurred with the same kinetics as the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which resulted in the upregulation of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). In thymic lymphomas, GRP78 levels were higher than those in virus-infected preleukemic cells, and GRP58 was upregulated. These results suggest that Env precursor accumulation induces ER stress, which participates in thymic lymphocyte apoptosis.

However, the impact of Parp-1-deficiency on the regulation of genome-wide gene expression has not been fully studied yet. RESULTS: We employed a microarray analysis covering 12,488 genes and ESTs using mouse Parp-1-deficient (Parp-1-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and the livers of Parp-1-/- mice and their wild-type (Parp-1+/+) counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that of the 9,907 genes analyzed, in Parp-1-/- ES cells, 9.6% showed altered gene expression. Of these, 6.3% and 3.3% of the genes were down- or up-regulated by 2-fold or greater, respectively, compared with Parp-1+/+ ES cells (p < 0.05). In the livers of Parp-1-/- mice, of the 12,353 genes that were analyzed, 2.0% or 1.3% were down- and up-regulated, respectively (p < 0.05). Notably, the number of down-regulated genes was higher in both ES cells and livers, than that of the up-regulated genes. The genes that showed altered expression in ES cells or in the livers are ascribed to various cellular processes, including metabolism, signal transduction, cell cycle control and transcription. We also observed expression of the genes involved in the pathway of extraembryonic tissue development is augmented in Parp-1-/- ES cells, including H19. After withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor, expression of H19 as well as other trophoblast marker genes were further up-regulated in Parp-1-/- ES cells compared to Parp-1+/+ ES cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Parp-1 is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale. The gene expression profiles in Parp-1-deficient cells may be useful to delineate the functional role of Parp-1 in epigenetic regulation of the genomes involved in various biological phenomena.","['Ogino, Hideki', 'Nozaki, Tadashige', 'Gunji, Akemi', 'Maeda, Miho', 'Suzuki, Hiroshi', 'Ohta, Tsutomu', 'Murakami, Yasufumi', 'Nakagama, Hitoshi', 'Sugimura, Takashi', 'Masutani, Mitsuko']","['Ogino H', 'Nozaki T', 'Gunji A', 'Maeda M', 'Suzuki H', 'Ohta T', 'Murakami Y', 'Nakagama H', 'Sugimura T', 'Masutani M']","['ADP-ribosylation in Oncology Project, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1, Tsukiji 5-chome, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. hogino@gan2.res.ncc.go.jp <hogino@gan2.res.ncc.go.jp>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['EC 2.4.2.30 (Parp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-8-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-41 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Feb 7;8:41. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-41.,,PMC1810537,,,,20070207,,,,,,,['BMC Genomics. 207;8:227'],,,,,

In the present study, we found that melatonin reduced the growth of the human myeloid leukemia cells HL-60, inhibiting progression from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle and increasing apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, melatonin treatment elevated cytochrome c release from mitochondria and augmented caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities. Upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 was also observed upon melatonin treatment. The effects of melatonin were found not to be mediated by membrane receptors for the indoleamine. Together, our results suggest that melatonin reduces the viability of HL-60 cells via induction of apoptosis primarily through regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 expression.","['Rubio, Sara', 'Estevez, Francisco', 'Cabrera, Javier', 'Reiter, Russel J', 'Loro, Juan', 'Quintana, Jose']","['Rubio S', 'Estevez F', 'Cabrera J', 'Reiter RJ', 'Loro J', 'Quintana J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular y Fisiologia, Centro de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Melatonin/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JPI392 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00392.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2007 Mar;42(2):131-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00392.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we measured telomere length by quantitative-PCR in 223 B-cell lymphomas/leukemias and correlated results with immunoglobulin (Ig) mutation status and immunostainings for GC/non-GC subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Shortest telomeres were found in Ig-unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [median telomere to single copy gene value (T/S) 0.33], differing significantly to Ig-mutated CLL (0.63). Contrary to this, mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) exhibited similar telomere lengths regardless of Ig mutation status (0.47). Telomere length differed significantly between GC-like (0.73) and non-GC-like DLBCLs (0.43), and follicular lymphomas (FLs) had shorter telomeres (0.53) than GC-DLBCL. Hairy cell leukemias, which display Ig gene intraclonal heterogeneity, had longer telomeres (0.62) than FLs and non-GC-DLBCL, but shorter than GC-DLBCL. We conclude that although DLBCL and CLL subsets can be clearly distinguished, telomere length reflects many parameters and may not simply correlate with GC-related origin.","['Walsh, Sarah H', 'Grabowski, Pawel', 'Berglund, Mattias', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Thorselius, Mia', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Laurell, Anna', 'Enblad, Gunilla', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Roos, Goran']","['Walsh SH', 'Grabowski P', 'Berglund M', 'Thunberg U', 'Thorselius M', 'Tobin G', 'Aleskog A', 'Karlsson K', 'Sundstrom C', 'Laurell A', 'Enblad G', 'Rosenquist R', 'Roos G']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Germinal Center/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH817 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00817.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Apr;78(4):283-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00817.x.

In this study, we employ DNA microarray technology to detect chromosomal aberrations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as in leukemic cell lines. METHODS: Reverse transcription using a random 9-mer primer was performed with total RNA from patients and leukemic cells lines. Multiplex PCR reactions using four groups of primer sets were then performed for amplification of cDNA from reverse-transcribed total RNA samples. Normal and fusion sequences were distinguished by hybridization of the amplified cDNA to a selective oligonucleotide array (SOA) containing 20-30mer synthetic probes. A total of 23 sets of oligomers were fabricated on glass slides for the detection of normal and fusion genes, as follows: BCR/ABL, AML/EAP, AML/ETO, AML/MDS, PML/RARA, NUMA1/RARA, PLZF/RARA, and CBFB/MYH. RESULTS: Gene translocation in leukemia was effectively identified with the SOA containing various leukemia-specific fusion and normal control sequences. Leukemic fusion sequences from patients and cell lines hybridized specifically to their complementary probes. The probe sets differing by approximately 50% at their 5' or 3' ends could distinguish between normal and fusion sequences. The entire process of detection was completed within 8 hours using the SOA method. CONCLUSIONS: Probe sets on SOA can effectively discriminate between leukemia-specific fusion and normal sequences with a chip hybridization procedure. The oligonucleotide array presents several advantages in identifying leukemic gene translocations, such as multiplex screening, relatively low cost, and speed.","['Chun, Sung-Min', 'Kim, Yoo-Li', 'Choi, Hee Baeg', 'Oh, Yong-Taek', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Tai-Gyu', 'Yang, Eun Gyeong', 'Park, Yong-Keun', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Han, Byoung-Don']","['Chun SM', 'Kim YL', 'Choi HB', 'Oh YT', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim TG', 'Yang EG', 'Park YK', 'Kim DW', 'Han BD']","['Life Sciences Division, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/04/24 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1113 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256220 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2007;11(1):21-8. doi: 10.1007/BF03256220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a novel finding that PI 3-K inhibition by LY294002 significantly increases p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in PMA-stimulated human leukemia cells NB4 and THP1. LY294002 potentiated expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 via a p53-independent mechanism and did not affect mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) experiments revealed that blocking of PI 3-K was associated with increased binding of transcription factor Sp1 to the PMA-responsive sites on the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Pretreatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR kinase, decreased the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 protein in PMA-stimulated NB4 cells. The level of PMA-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression was lower in NB4 cells overexpressing wild type protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) compared to those transfected with empty vector or with kinase inactive PKC zeta. Sp1 binding to the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter was completely lost in a wild type PKC zeta overexpressing and PMA-stimulated NB4 cells. We demonstrate that PI 3-K signaling pathway suppresses PMA-induced expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 in human leukemia cells, and that this effect is partly mediated by PKC zeta.","['Pivoriunas, Augustas', 'Savickiene, Jurate', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Tunaitis, Virginijus', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric']","['Pivoriunas A', 'Savickiene J', 'Treigyte G', 'Tunaitis V', 'Navakauskiene R', 'Magnusson KE']","['Department of Experimental Research, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Zygimantu 9, 01102, Vilnius, Lithuania. augustas.pivoriunas@ekmi.vu.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2007/02/09 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-007-9419-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2007 Aug;302(1-2):9-18. doi: 10.1007/s11010-007-9419-4.

The classical approach to diagnosis of PNH by cytometry involves the loss of at least two GPI-linked antigens on RBCs and neutrophils. While flow assays are more sensitive and specific than complement-mediated lysis or the Hams test, they suffer from several drawbacks. Bacterial aerolysin binds to the GPI moiety of cell surface GPI-linked molecules and causes lysis of normal but not GPI-deficient PNH cells. FLAER is an Alexa488-labeled inactive variant of aerolysin that does not cause lysis of cells. Our goals were to develop a FLAER-based assay to diagnose and monitor patients with PNH and to improve detection of minor populations of PNH clones in other hematologic disorders. METHODS: In a single tube assay, we combined FLAER with CD45, CD33, and CD14 allowing the simultaneous analysis of FLAER and the GPI-linked CD14 structure on neutrophil and monocyte lineages. RESULTS: Comparison to standard CD55 and CD59 analysis showed excellent agreement. Because of the higher signal to noise ratio, the method shows increased sensitivity in our hands over single (CD55 or CD59) parameter analysis. Using this assay, we were able to detect as few as 1% PNH monocytes and neutrophils in aplastic anemia, that were otherwise undetectable using CD55 and CD59 on RBC's. We also observed abnormal FLAER staining of blast populations in acute leukemia. In these cases, the neutrophils stained normally with FLAER, while the gated CD33bright cells failed to express normal levels of CD14 and additionally showed aberrant CD45 staining and bound lower levels of FLAER. CONCLUSION: FLAER combined with multiparameter flow cytometry offers an improved assay for diagnosis and monitoring of PNH clones and may have utility in detection of unsuspected myeloproliferative disorders.","['Sutherland, D Robert', 'Kuek, Nancy', 'Davidson, Jeff', 'Barth, David', 'Chang, Hong', 'Yeo, Erik', 'Bamford, Sylvia', 'Chin-Yee, Ian', 'Keeney, Michael']","['Sutherland DR', 'Kuek N', 'Davidson J', 'Barth D', 'Chang H', 'Yeo E', 'Bamford S', 'Chin-Yee I', 'Keeney M']","['Clinical Flow Cytometry Laboratory, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. rob.southerland@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Whereas clinical trials evaluating monotherapy with IM in AML revealed low response rates, Ara-C and IM showed synergistic effects in vitro. This suggested evaluation of a combination treatment. METHODS: Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) combined with IM was tested to determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen. Forty patients from 4 centers with c-Kit-positive AML (n = 34) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) (n = 6) with a median age of 73 years were enrolled. They were either not eligible for myelosuppressive therapy and/or had recurring/refractory disease. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for analysis. In 6 of 38 patients a blast response was observed. Eight of 38 patients showed stable disease for more than 2 months. The objective hematologic response rate was low (11%), with 2 patients showing hematologic improvement and 1 each with a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). Median overall survival was 138 days, with 20% of patients alive after an observation period of 600 days.

CONCLUSIONS: LDAC plus IM does not appear to be inferior in older AML patients incomparison with historic controls receiving myelosuppressive therapy.

Of these, 288 (25%) were positive for t(12;21)(p13;q22) [ETV6/RUNX1]. G-banding analyses were successful in 245 (85%); 43 (15%) were karyotypic failures. The modal chromosome numbers, incidence, types, and numbers of additional abnormalities, genomic imbalances, and chromosomal breakpoints in the 245 karyotypically informative cases, as well as in 152 previously reported cytogenetically characterized t(12;21)-positive ALLs in the same age group, were ascertained. The most common modal numbers among the 397 cases were 46 (67%), 47 (16%), 48 (6%), and 45 (5%). High-hyperdiploidy, triploidy, and tetraploidy were each found in approximately 1%; none had less than 40 chromosomes. Secondary chromosomal abnormalities were identified by chromosome banding in 248 (62%) of the 397 ALLs. Of these, 172 (69%) displayed only unbalanced changes, 14 (6%) only balanced aberrations, and 26 (10%) harbored both unbalanced and balanced abnormalities; 36 (15%) were uninformative because of incomplete karyotypes. The numbers of secondary changes varied between 1 and 19, with a median of 2 additional aberrations per cytogenetically abnormal case. The most frequent genomic imbalances were deletions of 6q21-27 (18%), 8p11-23 (6%), 9p13-24 (7%), 11q23-25 (6%), 12p11-13 (27%), 13q14-34 (7%), loss of the X chromosome (8%), and gains of 10 (9%), 16 (6%), and 21 (29%); no frequent partial gains were noted. The chromosome bands most often involved in structural rearrangements were 3p21 (2%), 5q13 (2%), 6q12 (2%), 6q14 (2%), 6q16 (2%), 6q21 (10%), 6q23 (6%), 6q25 (3%), 9p13 (2%), 11q13 (2%), 11q23 (2%), 12p11 (6%), 12p12 (7%), 12p13 (25%), 21q10 (6%), and 21q22 (6%). Considering that the t(12;21) is known to arise in utero and that the postnatal latency period is protracted, additional mutations are most likely necessary for overt ALL. The frequently rearranged chromosome regions may harbor genes of importance for the transformation and/or progression of an initial preleukemic t(12;21)-positive clone.","['Forestier, Erik', 'Andersen, Mette K', 'Autio, Kirsi', 'Blennow, Elisabeth', 'Borgstrom, Georg', 'Golovleva, Irina', 'Heim, Sverre', 'Heinonen, Kristina', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Johannsson, Johann H', 'Kerndrup, Gitte', 'Nordgren, Ann', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Swolin, Birgitta', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Forestier E', 'Andersen MK', 'Autio K', 'Blennow E', 'Borgstrom G', 'Golovleva I', 'Heim S', 'Heinonen K', 'Hovland R', 'Johannsson JH', 'Kerndrup G', 'Nordgren A', 'Rosenquist R', 'Swolin B', 'Johansson B']","['Pediatrics Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden. erik.forestier@pediatri.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETV1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iceland', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20423 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 May;46(5):440-50. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20423.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,"['Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)', 'Swedish Cytogenetic Leukemia Study Group (SCLSG)', 'NOPHO Leukemia Cytogenetic Study Group (NLCSG)']",,,,,,,,,

One of the approaches is the use of cancer vaccines based on leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DC). Recent studies from our laboratory and other laboratories have shown that CD40 stimulation improves leukemia cells immunogenicity and generates an antitumor immune response. The design of future cancer vaccines requires the knowledge concerning the function of dendritic cells including antigen processing. The aim of our present study was the assessment of antigen-processing machinery (APM) components in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells before and after CD40 stimulation at messenger RNA (mRNA) level. Twenty-five children with ALL were enrolled into the study. Leukemic cells were stimulated (or not) with CD40L and IL-4. Elements of the antigen-processing machinery (MB1, LMP2, LMP7, LMP10, TAP1, TAP2, calnexin, calreticulin, tapasin, ERp57, zeta, delta) were determined by real-time PCR technique. The expression of important costimulatory and adhesion molecules considered as DC markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86) were determined at the mRNA (PCR) and protein (flow cytometry) levels. The following are the results of our study: (1) We noted an upregulation of all costimulatory and adhesion molecules at the mRNA and protein levels in ALL cells after the culture; (2) the significant rise in expression of nearly all APM components after CD40 stimulation was observed. This confirms specific stimulation of the antigen-processing system in ALL cells by CD40L. Future work should focus on the clinical significance of these findings for immunotherapy in leukemias.","['Luczynski, Wlodzimierz', 'Kowalczuk, Oksana', 'Ilendo, Elzbieta', 'Stasiak-Barmuta, Anna', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Luczynski W', 'Kowalczuk O', 'Ilendo E', 'Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. w.luczynski@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigen Presentation/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/*drug effects/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0256-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 May;86(5):339-45. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0256-z.

We set-up a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay followed by capillary electrophoresis, designed to simultaneously screen the two main genetic lesions associated with CMDs, i.e. the BCR-ABL fusion characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia and the JAK2 V617F mutation that characterises polycythaemia vera and a proportion of cases of essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis.

The aim of this work was the investigation of the effect of sulfoethylated (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (SEG) in the treatment of experimental murine leukoses in combination with cyclophosphamide (CPA) and its ability to modulate the activity of lysosomal enzymes in tumor tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The solid forms of inoculated murine leukoses P388 and L1210/1 were transplantated to male DBA/2 mice. The therapy was performed by treating animals with CPA (Biokhimik, Saransk, Russia) alone or in combination with SEG (Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovakia). CPA was administered in saline as a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection on the 10th day after tumor transplantation; SEG was administered to mice ip 3 days after tumor transplantation with the intervals in 3 days. The therapy effect was estimated by measuring of solid tumor volume. Activity of the cysteine proteases--cathepsins B and L--was measured fluorometrically using fluorescent substrates Z-Arg-Arg-MCA and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Sigma, USA), respectively. The apoptosis was estimated evaluating the number of cells with fragmented nuclei using optical microscope. RESULTS: It has been demonstrated that application SEG leads to inhibition of tumor growth and potentiates therapeutic action of CPA, especially at repeated administrations during the whole treatment/observation At addition of SEG, therapeutic effect of a one-half reduced dose of CPA is equal or higher than that of the full dose. Therapeutic action of CPA and SEG on the studied tumors is realized predominantly through induction of apoptosis and is accompanied by a substantial increase of the activity of cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L in tumor tissues. The highest cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity in tumor tissue accompanied with the strongest inhibition of tumor growth. It is suggested that this phenomenon is due to the infiltration of the macrophages rich in the named enzymes into the tumor, where they phagocytize the apoptotic cells and tissue debris. CONCLUSION: Utilization of this polysaccharide BRM, sulfoethylated (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, might potentially enhance efficiency of antitumor therapy with standard cytostatics without a need of substantial increase of their dosage and hence avoiding their toxic side-effects.","['Khalikova, T A', 'Korolenko, T A', 'Zhanaeva, S Ya', 'Kaledin, V I', 'Kogan, G']","['Khalikova TA', 'Korolenko TA', 'Zhanaeva SY', 'Kaledin VI', 'Kogan G']","['Institute of Physiology, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Ctsl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cathepsin B/drug effects', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'beta-Glucans/*therapeutic use']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['29/580 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2006 Dec;28(4):308-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of its extensive metabolic inactivation and limited activity in chemotherapy, new analogues of araC are being tested. The aim of this work was to synthetize two araC conjugates and evaluates their cytotoxic/antileukemic activity. METHODS: Synthesis of araC-sulfonamide conjugates A and B was performed in anhydrous conditions using cyclostyling and 5'-chlorocyclocytidine as starting material. Elemental analysis and NMR, IR and UV spectrometry were used for structure confirmation. The synthesized araC conjugates were tested for their cytotoxicity in L1210 leukemia cells in vitro and for therapeutic activity and toxicity in vivo in leukemia L1210-bearing mice. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activities of araC and two synthesized conjugates A and B were expressed as IC(50) (micromol/l) and were compared respectively. The conjugate A is 303-times less active and the conjugate B is 757-times less active than araC. Consequently, the antileukemic activity and the acute toxicity of these compounds were examined in experiments involving leukemia L1210-bearing mice. Statistically significant therapeutic outcome was observed when the dosage of both araC conjugates was increased 10-times compared to araC. Next, the ration of cytotoxicity vs therapeutic activity for araC and both conjugates was performed. It was recorded that the ration between cytotoxicity and therapeutic activity for araC is 3333, for the conjugate A and B, the ration is significantly lower (110 and 44). This indicates that the inactivation of araC conjugate A is 30-times slower and the inactivation of conjugate B is 75-times slower as araC inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in cytotoxic and therapeutic activity registered in araC treatment and between two araC-analogues are most probably caused by slow liberation of araC from both conjugates. We are considered that prolonged araC liberation protected them from inactivation and extended the time period of therapeutic action both araC conjugates. The obtained results can serve as stimuli for further investigation of new araC-analogues.","['Novotny, L', 'Phillips, O A', 'Rauko, P', 'Miadokova, E']","['Novotny L', 'Phillips OA', 'Rauko P', 'Miadokova E']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kuwait University, Kuwait.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['29/577 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2006 Dec;28(4):293-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compound-6 purified from an ethyl acetate extract of black soybean vinegar using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) induced fragmentation of DNA and the development of apoptotic bodies (characteristic physiological features of apoptosis) in U937 cells. By analysis of chemical structure, this active compound was identified as tryptophol. Tryptophol induced apoptosis involving caspase-8 and -3 activation, followed by cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), as shown by measurement of enzyme activity and immunoblot analysis. The cell viability of normal lymphocytes separated from human blood was less affected by tryptophol, and fragmentation of DNA was not induced in normal lymphocytes. These results indicate that tryptophol isolated from black soybean vinegar inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells by inducing apoptosis via a pathway involving caspase-8 followed by caspase-3, without affecting normal lymphocytes.","['Inagaki, Shyuichiro', 'Morimura, Shigeru', 'Gondo, Kazunobu', 'Tang, Yueqin', 'Akutagawa, Hiroshi', 'Kida, Kenji']","['Inagaki S', 'Morimura S', 'Gondo K', 'Tang Y', 'Akutagawa H', 'Kida K']","['Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '5809LZ7G1U (tryptophol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q40Q9N063P (Acetic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetic Acid/*chemistry', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Soybeans/*chemistry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'U937 Cells']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bbb/60336 [pii]', '10.1271/bbb.60336 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2007 Feb;71(2):371-9. doi: 10.1271/bbb.60336.

The available evidence is conflicting, with most risk estimates based on sparse numbers. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated cause-specific mortality in patients with hairy cell leukemia. METHODS: We quantified second cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality among 3104 two-month survivors of hairy cell leukemia who were reported to 16 population-based registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program between 1973 and 2002. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to quantify the risk of second cancers and causes of death, respectively. The cumulative probability of a second cancer among survivors of hairy cell leukemia was calculated using a competing risk model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Mean follow-up of hairy cell leukemia survivors was 6.5 years (range, 2 months-29.3 years). Second cancer risk was statistically significantly elevated (SIR = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.37) compared with the general population. Survivors had statistically significantly higher risks of Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 6.61, 95% CI = 2.13 to 15.42), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 5.03, 95% CI = 3.77 to 6.58), and thyroid cancer (SIR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.30 to 7.74) and a lower risk of lung cancer (SIR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.90). The cumulative probability of all second cancers was estimated to be 31.9% (95% CI = 26.2 to 37.6) 25 years after hairy cell leukemia diagnosis. Among 10,000 hairy cell leukemia patients, a total excess of about 34 cancers, including 21 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 2 Hodgkin lymphomas, and 7 solid tumors (including 2 thyroid cancers), might be observed per year. Deaths due to solid tumors were not elevated compared with the general population (SMR = 0.9), and there were statistically significant deficits in mortality due to both cardiovascular (SMR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.80) and cerebrovascular (SMR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.93) disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hairy cell leukemia are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancer. The decrease in lung cancer incidence and smoking-associated vascular mortality may reflect an inverse association of tobacco use with hairy cell leukemia. Future studies should address the roles of immunologic impairment inherent to hairy cell leukemia, treatment modalities, and other factors as codeterminants of morbidity and mortality in hairy cell leukemia survivors.","['Hisada, Michie', 'Chen, Bingshu E', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Hisada M', 'Chen BE', 'Jaffe ES', 'Travis LB']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 6120 Executive Blvd., EPS 8008, Bethesda, MD 20892-7201, USA. hisadam@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['99/3/215 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djk030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 Feb 7;99(3):215-22. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djk030.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these growth factors support chemotherapy, their long-term safety has not been evaluated. We studied the association between G-CSF use and incidence of leukemia in a population-based sample of breast cancer patients. METHODS: Among women aged 65 years or older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed with stages I-III breast cancer from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 1999, we identified those who received G-CSF or GM-CSF concurrently with chemotherapy. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios for the association of treatment with G-CSF or GM-CSF and subsequent (through December 31, 2003) diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 5510 women treated with chemotherapy, 906 (16%) received G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy, and 64 (1.16%) were subsequently diagnosed with either MDS or AML before a cancer recurrence. Use of G-CSF and GM-CSF was associated with more recent diagnosis, younger age, urban residence, fewer comorbidities, receipt of radiation therapy, positive lymph nodes, and cyclophosphamide treatment. Of the 906 patients who were treated with G-CSF, 16 (1.77%) developed AML or MDS; of the 4604 patients not treated with G-CSF, 48 (1.04%) developed AML or MDS. The hazard rate ratio for AML or MDS among those treated with G-CSF or GM-CSF compared with those who were not was 2.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12 to 4.08). AML or MDS developed within 48 months of breast cancer diagnosis in 1.8% of patients who received G-CSF or GM-CSF but only in 0.7% of patients who did not (hazard ratio = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.30 to 5.15). CONCLUSIONS: The use of G-CSF was associated with a doubling in the risk of subsequent AML or MDS among the population that we studied, although the absolute risk remained low. Even if this association is confirmed, the benefits of G-CSF may still outweigh the risks. Meanwhile, however, G-CSF use should not be assumed to be risk free.","['Hershman, Dawn', 'Neugut, Alfred I', 'Jacobson, Judith S', 'Wang, Jian', 'Tsai, Wei-Yann', 'McBride, Russell', 'Bennett, Charles L', 'Grann, Victor R']","['Hershman D', 'Neugut AI', 'Jacobson JS', 'Wang J', 'Tsai WY', 'McBride R', 'Bennett CL', 'Grann VR']","['Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. dlh23@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Comorbidity', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Medicare', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Selection', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['99/3/196 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djk028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 Feb 7;99(3):196-205. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djk028.,"['1R01CA 102713-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA89155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA95597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA60553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 Feb 7;99(3):183-6.

For example, we have recently observed that concomitant with inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces genes regulating lipid metabolism in fetal rat calvaria (RC) cell cultures. In this study, we further investigated the adipogenic capacity of LIF-treated RC cells. Quantitative analyses revealed that LIF increased the adipocyte differentiation induced by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist BRL49653 (BRL) in RC cell populations. Gene expression profiling of individual RC cell colonies in untreated cells or cells treated with LIF, BRL, or combined LIF-BRL suggested that some adipocytes arose from bipotential or other primitive precursors, including osteoprogenitors, since many colonies co-expressed osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation markers, whereas some arose from other cell pools, most likely committed preadipocytes present in the population. These analyses further suggested that LIF and BRL do not act at the same stages of the mesenchymal hierarchy, but rather that LIF modifies differentiation of precursor cells, whereas BRL acts later to favor adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that LIF increased adipocyte differentiation at least in part by altering the fate of osteoblastic cells and their precursors.","['Falconi, Dominic', 'Oizumi, Kiyoshi', 'Aubin, Jane E']","['Falconi D', 'Oizumi K', 'Aubin JE']","[""Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Medical Sciences Building, Room 6233, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ibsp protein, mouse)', '0 (Ibsp protein, rat)', '0 (Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Skull/cytology/drug effects', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/2/305 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2006-0417 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2007 Feb;25(2):305-12. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY SUBJECTS: Twenty-four-hour spontaneous GH secretion was studied by 20-min sampling both in the fed state (n = 16; six women) and the last 24 h of 33-h fast (n = 10; three women) in adult cancer survivors of normal GH status defined by two GH provocative tests, 13.1 +/- 1.6 (range, 3-28) yr after cranial irradiation (18-40 Gy) for nonpituitary brain tumors (n = 12) or leukemia (n = 4) in comparison with 30 (nine women) age- and body mass index-matched normal controls (fasting, 11 men and three women). RESULTS: Using previously published diagnostic thresholds, all patients had stimulated peak GH responses in the normal range to both the insulin tolerance test and the combined GHRH plus arginine stimulation test, as well as normal individual mean profile GH levels during the fed and fasting states. However, gender-specific comparisons revealed marked reduction (by 40%) in the overall peak GH responses to both provocative tests but similar GH secretory profiles; no differences were seen in the pulsatile attributes of GH secretion (cluster analysis) or the profile absolute and mean GH levels in the fed state or when the hypothalamic-pituitary axis was stimulated by fasting. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced GH neurosecretory dysfunction either does not exist or is a very rare phenomenon in irradiated adult cancer survivors. The normality of physiological GH secretion in the context of reduced maximum somatotroph reserve suggests compensatory overdrive of the partially damaged somatotroph axis and constitutes a relative argument against somatotroph dysfunction being explained purely by hypothalamic damage with secondary atrophy due to GHRH deficiency. It is therefore possible that radiation in doses less than 40 Gy causes dual damage to both the pituitary and the hypothalamus.","['Darzy, Ken H', 'Pezzoli, Suzan S', 'Thorner, Michael O', 'Shalet, Stephen M']","['Darzy KH', 'Pezzoli SS', 'Thorner MO', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, United Kingdom. stephen.m.shalet@man.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Function Tests', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Adult', 'Arginine', 'Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Fasting/physiology', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Human Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pituitary Diseases/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survivors']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['jc.2006-2599 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2006-2599 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2007 May;92(5):1666-72. doi: 10.1210/jc.2006-2599.

We here report BCR-ABL- and c-MYC-dependent regulation of miRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using microarray analysis (miCHIP) and miRNA-specific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (miR-qRT-PCR). In 3 bcr-abl-positive cell lines, expression of miRNAs encoded within the polycistronic miR-17-92 cluster is specifically down-regulated (2- to 5-fold) by both imatinib treatment and anti-BCR-ABL RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, anti-c-MYC RNAi reduces miR-17-92 expression in K562 cells in which miRNAs can specifically repress reporter gene expression, as demonstrated by specific miRNA inhibition with antagomirs. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of polycistronic miRNAs in K562 cells confers increased proliferation, partial resistance against anti-c-MYC RNAi, and enhanced sensitivity to imatinib-induced cell death. Finally, we determined miR-17-92 expression in purified normal (n = 4), early chronic-phase (CP) (n = 24), and blast-crisis (BC) (n = 7) CML CD34(+) cells and found up-regulation of polycistronic pri-miRNA transcripts in CML and mature miRNAs in CP but not in BC CML. These data are in accordance with a BCR-ABL-c-MYC-miR-17-92 pathway that mediates enhanced miRNA expression in CP but not BC CML CD34(+) cells. Altered miRNA expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease and may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Venturini, Letizia', 'Battmer, Karin', 'Castoldi, Mirco', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muckenthaler, Martina U', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Scherr, Michaela']","['Venturini L', 'Battmer K', 'Castoldi M', 'Schultheis B', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muckenthaler MU', 'Ganser A', 'Eder M', 'Scherr M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'Transfection']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41565-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-045104 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4399-405. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-045104.

To validate this finding, we measured CLLU1 mRNA expression levels by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 175 patients with CLL. Analyses of IgV(H) mutational status, ZAP-70 expression, CD38 expression, and chromosomal aberrations were also performed. High levels of CLLU1 expression were associated with shorter overall survival (P < .001), with a 7% increase in risk of early death by each doubling of the CLLU1 expression level. Stratification for age at diagnosis demonstrated a strong prognostic significance of CLLU1 expression in patients younger than 70 years (P < .001), but not in patients aged 70 or older (P = .61). The prognostic significance of IgV(H) mutational status and ZAP-70 expression had a similar age-dependent variation. Multivariate analysis in the younger age group showed that CLLU1 expression analysis added further prognostic information within all prognostic subgroups, with the exception of patients with unmutated IgV(H) CLL. Only CLLU1 expression and IgV(H) mutational status had independent predictive power. Thus, analysis of CLLU1 expression is highly applicable in risk prediction in CLL for patients of an age eligible for risk stratification.","['Josefsson, Par', 'Geisler, Christian H', 'Leffers, Henrik', 'Petersen, Jorgen H', 'Andersen, Mette K', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Buhl, Anne Mette']","['Josefsson P', 'Geisler CH', 'Leffers H', 'Petersen JH', 'Andersen MK', 'Jurlander J', 'Buhl AM']","['The Leukemia Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. par.josefsson@pc.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CLLU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41501-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-11-054916 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 1;109(11):4973-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-054916.

Among the most frequent translocations are t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(9;11)(p22;q23), which give rise to the MLL-AFF1 and MLL-MLLT3 fusion genes (alias MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF9) in acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. Current evidence suggests that determining the MLL status of acute leukemia, including precise identification of the partner gene, is important in defining appropriate treatment. This underscores the need for accurate detection methods. A novel molecular diagnostic device, the MLL FusionChip, has been successfully used to identify MLL fusion gene translocations in acute leukemia, including the precise breakpoint location. This study evaluated the performance of the MLL FusionChip within a routine clinical environment, comprising nine centers worldwide, in the analysis of 21 control and 136 patient samples. It was shown that the assay allowed accurate detection of the MLL fusion gene, regardless of the breakpoint location, and confirmed that this multiplex approach was robust in a global multicenter trial. The MLL FusionChip was shown to be superior to other detection methods.

Commercial probes (Abbot Molecular) were used for 7q22, 7q31, and 7q35, the regions most frequently deleted in myeloid malignancies. In three cases without deletions, high-resolution multicolor banding (mBAND) for chromosome 7 revealed other aberrations. Five groups of chromosomal rearrangements were established: (a) deletion 7q as a sole aberration (2 cases), (b) deletion 7q and complex karyotypes (6 cases), (c) combined translocations and deletions of 7q (17 cases), (d) combined translocation and deletion 7p (5 cases), and (e) translocation of chromosomes 7 without deletion 7p or 7q (3 cases). Deletions of all three FISH-screened regions were the most frequent, with heterogeneous breakpoints. The region 7p13.2 approximately p15.2 was most commonly deleted. Most of the deletions were cryptic, not detectable with conventional cytogenetics.

HTLV-I is the main causative agent in adult T-cell leukemia in endemic areas and some of the simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses have been implicated in the induction of malignant lymphomas in their hosts. BLV causes enzootic bovine leukosis in infected cattle or sheep. During the past few years several new Deltaretrovirus isolates have been described in various primate species. Two new HTLV-like viruses in humans have recently been identified and provisionally termed HTLV-III and HTLV-IV. In order to identify a broad spectrum of Deltaretroviruses by a single PCR approach we have established a novel consensus PCR based on nucleotide sequence data obtained from 42 complete virus isolates (HTLV-I/-II, STLV-I/-II/-III, BLV). The primer sequences were based on highly interspecies-conserved virus genome regions. We used this PCR to detect Deltaretroviruses in samples from adult patients with a variety of rare T-cell neoplasms in Germany. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the consensus PCR was at least between 10-2 and 10-3 with 100% specificity as demonstrated by serial dilutions of cell lines infected with either HTLV-I, HTLV-II or BLV. Fifty acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples and 33 samples from patients with various rare mature T-cell neoplasms (T-PLL, Sezary syndrome and other T-NHL) were subsequently investigated. There were no cases with HTLV-I, HTLV-II or any other Deltaretroviruses. CONCLUSION: The results rule out a significant involvement of HTLV-I or HTLV-II in these disease entities and show that other related Deltaretroviruses are not likely to be involved. The newly established Deltaretrovirus PCR may be a useful tool for identifying new Deltaretroviruses.","['Burmeister, Thomas', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Burmeister T', 'Schwartz S', 'Hummel M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. thomas.burmeister@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-4-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-11 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Feb 7;4:11. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-11.,,PMC1802090,,,,20070207,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identified nuclear translocation of heparanase as a key step in cell differentiation. We applied an in vitro differentiation model of HL-60 cells with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), in which nuclear translocation of heparanase was observed using immunohistochemical analysis. In this system, nuclear translocation of heparanase was abolished by inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), suggesting the involvement of HSP90 in translocation of heparanase. We further confirmed that overexpression of active form of heparanase induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, although the catalytic negative form of heparanase did not. Therefore we speculate that nuclear translocation of enzymatically active heparanase may be involved in cellular differentiation. Our results suggest that a novel function of heparanase upon cell differentiation would raise a potential new strategy for cancer therapy of promyeloid leukemia and other types of cancer.","['Nobuhisa, Tetsuji', 'Naomoto, Yoshio', 'Okawa, Takaomi', 'Takaoka, Munenori', 'Gunduz, Mehmet', 'Motoki, Takayuki', 'Nagatsuka, Hitoshi', 'Tsujigiwa, Hidetsugu', 'Shirakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Yamatsuji, Tomoki', 'Haisa, Minoru', 'Matsuoka, Junji', 'Kurebayashi, Junichi', 'Nakajima, Motowo', ""Taniguchi, Shun'ichiro"", 'Sagara, Junji', 'Dong, Jian', 'Tanaka, Noriaki']","['Nobuhisa T', 'Naomoto Y', 'Okawa T', 'Takaoka M', 'Gunduz M', 'Motoki T', 'Nagatsuka H', 'Tsujigiwa H', 'Shirakawa Y', 'Yamatsuji T', 'Haisa M', 'Matsuoka J', 'Kurebayashi J', 'Nakajima M', 'Taniguchi S', 'Sagara J', 'Dong J', 'Tanaka N']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Transplant and Surgical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, 2-5-1 Shikatacho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Benzoquinones/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS420 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00420.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Apr;98(4):535-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00420.x.

It is specifically designed to inhibit the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson (ABL) fusion protein that results from the chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome. CML is characterised by this abnormality, which leads to abnormalities of the peripheral blood and bone marrow including an increase in the number of granular leukocytes. Imatinib is approved in numerous countries worldwide for the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic-phase CML, Ph+ accelerated-phase or blast-crisis CML, and in patients with Ph+ chronic-phase CML who have failed to respond to interferon-alpha therapy. It is also indicated in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ chronic-phase CML, in accelerated-phase or blast-crisis CML, or in chronic-phase CML after failure of interferon-alpha therapy or when the disease has recurred after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Approved indications, however, may vary by country. Imatinib is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with Ph+ CML. In patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML, imatinib was more effective than interferon-alpha plus cytarabine in preventing progression of the disease and in achieving haematological and cytogenetic responses. Overall survival rates remain high after 5 years of follow-up, and historical comparisons with other treatments demonstrate improved overall survival with imatinib in the long term. Patients with accelerated-phase or blast-crisis CML, or those who have not responded to prior interferon-alpha therapy also benefit from imatinib treatment. Some patients become resistant or intolerant to imatinib therapy; management strategies to overcome these problems include dosage adjustment, other treatments, or combination therapy with imatinib and other agents. Allogeneic HSCT is currently the only potentially curative treatment, but it is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is not suitable for all patients. The introduction of imatinib has had a marked impact on outcomes in patients with CML. It remains a valuable treatment for all stages of the disease, especially initial treatment of newly diagnosed Ph+ chronic-phase CML, and is endorsed by European and US treatment guidelines as a first-line option.","['Moen, Marit D', 'McKeage, Kate', 'Plosker, Greg L', 'Siddiqui, M Asif A']","['Moen MD', 'McKeage K', 'Plosker GL', 'Siddiqui MA']","['Wolters Kluwer Health, Adis, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2007/02/08 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['67210 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200767020-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2007;67(2):299-320. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200767020-00010.,,,,,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it may be accompanied by increased toxicity compared with fludarabine alone. E2997 is a phase III randomized Intergroup trial comparing fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC arm) versus fludarabine (F arm) alone in patients receiving their first chemotherapy regimen for CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Symptomatic, previously untreated patients with CLL were randomly assigned to receive either fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 through 5 or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV day 1 and fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV days 1 through 5. These cycles were repeated every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles. RESULTS: A total of 278 patients were randomly assigned in this Intergroup study. Treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was associated with a significantly higher complete response (CR) rate (23.4% v 4.6%; P < .001) and a higher overall response (OR) rate (74.3% v 59.5%, P = .013) than treatment with fludarabine as a single agent. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also superior in patients treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide than those treated with fludarabine (31.6 v 19.2 months, P < .0001). Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide caused additional hematologic toxicity, including more severe thrombocytopenia (P = .046), but it did not increase the number of severe infections (P = .812). CONCLUSION: Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide produced an increase in OR and CR, and it improved PFS in patients with previously untreated CLL compared with fludarabine alone and was not associated with an increase in infectious toxicity.","['Flinn, Ian W', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Bennett, John M', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Hussein, Mohamad A', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Moore, Dennis F Jr', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Flinn IW', 'Neuberg DS', 'Grever MR', 'Dewald GW', 'Bennett JM', 'Paietta EM', 'Hussein MA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Larson RA', 'Moore DF Jr', 'Tallman MS']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA. iflinn@tnonc.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.08.0762 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.0762 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):793-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.0762.

In addition, ZAP-70 and Bcl-2 family proteins have been explored as predictors of outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the prognostic significance of a comprehensive panel of laboratory factors on both response and progression-free survival (PFS) using samples and data from 235 patients enrolled onto a therapeutic trial. Patients received either fludarabine (FL; n = 113) or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC; n = 122) as part of a US Intergroup randomized trial for previously untreated CLL patients. RESULTS: Complete response (CR) rates were 24.6% for patients receiving FC and 5.3% for patients receiving FL (P = .00004). PFS was statistically significantly longer in patients receiving FC (median, 33.5 months for patients receiving FC and 19.9 months for patients receiving FL; P < .0001). The occurrence of del(17p13.1) (hazard ratio, 3.428; P = .0002) or del(11q22.3) (hazard ratio, 1.904; P = .006) was associated with reduced PFS. CR and overall response rates were not significantly different based on cytogenetics, IgVH mutational status, CD38 expression, or p53 mutational status. Expression of ZAP-70, Bcl-2, Bax, Mcl-1, XIAP, Caspase-3, and Traf-1 was not associated with either clinical response or PFS. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of interphase cytogenetic analysis, but not IgVH, CD38 expression, or ZAP-70 status, to predict outcome of FL-based chemotherapy. Patients with high-risk cytogenetic features should be considered for alternative therapies.","['Grever, Michael R', 'Lucas, David M', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Reed, John C', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Gribben, John G', 'Byrd, John C']","['Grever MR', 'Lucas DM', 'Dewald GW', 'Neuberg DS', 'Reed JC', 'Kitada S', 'Flinn IW', 'Tallman MS', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Larson RA', 'Paietta E', 'Jelinek DF', 'Gribben JG', 'Byrd JC']","['Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. michael.grever@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prospective Studies', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.08.3089 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.3089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):799-804. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.3089.

DNA methylation is among the most common alterations in leukemia. The potential role of DNA methylation as a biomarker in leukemia is unknown. In addition, the lack of molecular markers precludes minimal residual disease (MRD) estimation for most patients with hematologic malignancies. We analyzed the potential of aberrant DNA promoter methylation as a biomarker for MRD in acute leukemias. Quantitative real-time PCR methods with bisulfite-modified DNA were established to quantify MRD based on estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and/or p15(INK4B) methylation. Methylation analyses were done in >370 DNA specimens from 180 acute leukemia patients and controls. Methylation of ERalpha and/or p15(INK4B) occurred frequently and specifically in acute leukemia but not in healthy controls or in nonmalignant hematologic diseases. Aberrant DNA methylation was detectable in >20% of leukemia patients during clinical remission. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, methylation levels during clinical remission correlated closely with T-cell receptor/immunoglobulin MRD levels (r = +0.7, P < 0.01) and were associated with subsequent relapse. In acute myelogenous leukemia patients in clinical remission, increased methylation levels were associated with a high relapse risk and significantly reduced relapse-free survival (P = 0.003). Many patients with acute leukemia in clinical remission harbor increased levels of aberrant DNA methylation. Analysis of methylation MRD might be used as a novel biomarker for leukemia patients' relapse risk.","['Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Unterberg, Matthias', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'zur Stadt, Udo', 'Brunnberg, Uta', 'Verbeek, Walter', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Agrawal S', 'Unterberg M', 'Koschmieder S', 'zur Stadt U', 'Brunnberg U', 'Verbeek W', 'Buchner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Domagkstrasse 3, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/1370 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1681 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):1370-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1681.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that Treg increase, or selectively accumulate, within tumors and are sensitive to FasL-mediated apoptosis, we test here the hypothesis that inducing apoptosis of intratumoral Treg using FasL may improve adoptive T cell therapy. We show that FasL applied intratumorally via protein transfer decreases intratumoral Treg via inducing apoptosis in these cells. Significantly, we show that the use of FasL prior to the infusion of tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells enhances the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T cell transfer against established tumors, which is mediated by persistent, systemic antitumor immunity. Intratumoral FasL protein transfer also results in neutrophil infiltration of tumor. However, we show that intratumoral immunodepletion of neutrophils does not abolish the effect of FasL on adoptive transfer. Rather, the effect of FasL is completely abolished by cotransfer of Treg, isolated from the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Hence, our study shows for the first time that using FasL to predeplete intratumoral Treg provides a useful means for optimizing adoptive therapy.","['Chen, Aoshuang', 'Liu, Shanrong', 'Park, David', 'Kang, Youmin', 'Zheng, Guoxing']","['Chen A', 'Liu S', 'Park D', 'Kang Y', 'Zheng G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine at Rockford, University of Illinois, 1601 Parkview Avenue, Rockford, IL 61107, USA. aoshuang@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/1291 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2622 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):1291-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2622.,['R01 CA 92243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Via an elusive mechanism, a subpopulation of patients becomes unresponsive and/or relapses. To recapitulate various aspects of acquired resistance, rituximab-resistant (RR) clones were established from lymphoma lines and compared with parental cells. Surface CD20 expression was diminished in the clones. The clones neither responded to rituximab-mediated growth reduction or complement-dependent cytotoxicity nor underwent apoptosis in response to cross-linked rituximab. Rituximab failed to chemosensitize the RR clones, which exhibited constitutive hyperactivation of the nuclear factor-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways, leading to overexpression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-related gene (long alternatively spliced variant of Bcl-x gene), and myeloid cell differentiation 1 and higher drug resistance. Unlike parental cells, rituximab neither inhibited the activity of these pathways nor diminished the expression of resistant factors. Pharmacologic inhibitors of the survival pathways or Bcl-2 family members reduced the activity of these pathways, diminished antiapoptotic protein expression, and chemosensitized the RR clones. These novel in vitro results denote that continuous long-term rituximab exposure culminates in RR clones that do not respond to rituximab-mediated effects, have altered cellular signaling dynamics, and exhibit different genetic and phenotypic properties compared with parental cells. The data also reveal that although RR clones exhibit higher resistance to rituximab and cytotoxic drugs, these clones can be chemosensitized following treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors (e.g., dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, bortezomib, PD098059) that target survival/antiapoptotic pathways. The findings also identify intracellular targets for potential molecular therapeutic intervention to increase treatment efficacy.

Here, we evaluated the contribution of Bcl-2 family members to the in vitro cellular response of several SCLC cell lines to ABT-737. Relatively higher levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bim and Noxa, and lower levels of Mcl-1 characterized naive SCLC cell lines that were sensitive to ABT-737. Conversely, a progressive decrease in the relative levels of Bcl-2 and Noxa and a progressive increase in Mcl-1 levels characterized the increased resistance of H146 cells following chronic exposure to ABT-737. Knockdown of Mcl-1 with small interfering RNA sensitized two resistant SCLC cell lines H196 and DMS114 to ABT-737 by enhancing the induction of apoptosis. Likewise, up-regulation of Noxa sensitized H196 cells to ABT-737. Combination treatment with DNA-damaging agents was extremely synergistic with ABT-737 and was associated with the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the up-regulation of Noxa, Puma, and Bim in H196 cells. Thus, SCLC cells sensitive to ABT-737 expressed the target proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), whereas Mcl-1 and factors regulating Mcl-1 function seem to contribute to the overall resistance of SCLC cells to ABT-737. Overall, these observations provide further insight as to the mechanistic bases for ABT-737 efficacy in SCLC and will be helpful for profiling patients and aiding in the rational design of combination therapies.","['Tahir, Stephen K', 'Yang, Xiufen', 'Anderson, Mark G', 'Morgan-Lappe, Susan E', 'Sarthy, Aparna V', 'Chen, Jun', 'Warner, Robert B', 'Ng, Shi-Chung', 'Fesik, Stephen W', 'Elmore, Steve W', 'Rosenberg, Saul H', 'Tse, Christin']","['Tahir SK', 'Yang X', 'Anderson MG', 'Morgan-Lappe SE', 'Sarthy AV', 'Chen J', 'Warner RB', 'Ng SC', 'Fesik SW', 'Elmore SW', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Tse C']","['Global Pharmaceutical Product Research Division, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA. stephen.k.tahir@abbott.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/1176 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2203 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):1176-83. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Residual leukemia stem and progenitor cells persist in imatinib-responsive patients and may be a potential source of relapse. Previous studies indicate that imatinib preferentially targets dividing cells, and nondividing progenitor cells are resistant to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. We investigated whether growth factor stimulation of progenitor proliferation could reduce the number of residual nondividing cells remaining after imatinib treatment. CML and normal CD34(+) cells were labeled with 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to track cell division and cultured in low or high concentrations of growth factor to determine effects of growth factor stimulation on nondividing cells. High growth factor concentrations significantly enhanced CML proliferation with or without imatinib treatment and significantly reduced the number of viable, nondividing CFSE bright cells remaining after imatinib exposure. Stimulation with high growth factor before imatinib treatment further reduced the number of residual nondividing CML CD34(+) cells.

Here, we report the novel characterization of the interaction of Tax with a human cell protein named Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1). We show that TAX1BP1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that forms a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor. TAX1BP1 and Tax colocalize into intranuclear speckles that partially overlap with but are not identical to the PML oncogenic domains. Tax binds TAX1BP1 directly, induces the dissociation of TAX1BP1 from the glucocorticoid receptor-containing protein complex, and represses the coactivator function of TAX1BP1. Genetic knockout of Tax1bp1 in mice abrogates the influence of Tax on the activation of nuclear receptors. We propose that Tax-TAX1BP1 interaction mechanistically explains the previously reported repression of nuclear receptor activity by Tax.","['Chin, King-Tung', 'Chun, Abel C S', 'Ching, Yick-Pang', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh', 'Jin, Dong-Yan']","['Chin KT', 'Chun AC', 'Ching YP', 'Jeang KT', 'Jin DY']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (TAX1BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/1072 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3053 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):1072-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro and in vivo studies showed that XAB2 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and transcription-coupled DNA repair, leading to preimplantation lethality, and is essential for mouse embryogenesis. Retinoids are effective for the treatment of preneoplastic diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum and other dermatologic diseases such as photoaging. We therefore focused on defining the effect of XAB2 on cellular differentiation in the presence of ATRA treatment. In the present study, we showed that overexpression of XAB2 inhibited ATRA-induced cellular differentiation in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, and that knockdown of XAB2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased ATRA-sensitive cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 at both physiologic (10(-9)-10(-8) mol/L) and therapeutic (10(-7) mol/L) concentrations of ATRA. Moreover, we found that XAB2 was associated with retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and histone deacetylase 3 in the nuclei. Finally, using siRNA against XAB2, we showed that the ATRA-resistant neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 underwent cellular differentiation induced by ATRA at a therapeutic concentration (10(-6) mol/L). These results strongly suggest that XAB2 is a component of the RAR corepressor complex with an inhibitory effect on ATRA-induced cellular differentiation and that XAB2 plays a role in ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation as an important aspect of cancer therapy.","['Ohnuma-Ishikawa, Kumiko', 'Morio, Tomohiro', 'Yamada, Takayuki', 'Sugawara, Yuji', 'Ono, Makoto', 'Nagasawa, Masayuki', 'Yasuda, Akio', 'Morimoto, Chikao', 'Ohnuma, Kei', 'Dang, Nam H', 'Hosoi, Hajime', 'Verdin, Eric', 'Mizutani, Shuki']","['Ohnuma-Ishikawa K', 'Morio T', 'Yamada T', 'Sugawara Y', 'Ono M', 'Nagasawa M', 'Yasuda A', 'Morimoto C', 'Ohnuma K', 'Dang NH', 'Hosoi H', 'Verdin E', 'Mizutani S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate Medical School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 11308519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (XAB2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/1019 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1638 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):1019-29. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1638.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, it was not investigated whether INK4b is hypermethylated in all cytogenetic subtypes of AML. A comparison of levels of INK4b methylation in AML with the three most common cytogenetic alterations, inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17), revealed a strikingly low level of methylation in all leukemias with inv(16) compared with the other types. Surprisingly, the expression level of INK4b in inv(16)+ AML samples was low and comparable with that of the other subtypes. An investigation into an alternative mechanism of INK4b silencing determined that the loss of INK4b expression was caused by inv(16)-encoded core binding factor beta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (CBFbeta-SMMHC). The silencing was manifested in an inability to activate the normal expression of INK4b RNA as shown in vitamin D3-treated U937 cells expressing CBFbeta-SMMHC. CBFbeta-SMMHC was shown to displace RUNX1 from a newly determined CBF site in the promoter of INK4b. Importantly, this study (a) establishes that the gene encoding the tumor suppressor p15(INK4b) is a target of CBFbeta-SMMHC, a finding relevant to the leukemogenesis process, and (b) indicates that, in patients with inv(16)-containing AML, reexpression from the INK4b locus in the leukemia would not be predicted to occur using hypomethylating drugs.","['Markus, Jan', 'Garin, Matthew T', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Galili, Naomi', 'Raza, Azra', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Liu, P Paul', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Markus J', 'Garin MT', 'Bies J', 'Galili N', 'Raza A', 'Thirman MJ', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD', 'Liu PP', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute and National Human Genome Research Institute/NIH, 37 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/3/992 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2964 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 1;67(3):992-1000. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2964.,"['CA 84405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated for the first time whether such epigenetic changes are induced in healthy subjects by low-level exposure to benzene, a widespread pollutant associated with AML risk. Blood DNA samples and exposure data were obtained from subjects with different levels of benzene exposure, including 78 gas station attendants, 77 traffic police officers, and 58 unexposed referents in Milan, Italy (personal airborne benzene range, < 6-478 microg/m(3)). Bisulfite-PCR pyrosequencing was used to quantitate DNA methylation in long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and AluI repetitive elements as a surrogate of genome-wide methylation and examine gene-specific methylation of MAGE-1 and p15. Allele-specific pyrosequencing of the H19 gene was used to detect LOI in 96 subjects heterozygous for the H19 imprinting center G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism. Airborne benzene was associated with a significant reduction in LINE-1 (-2.33% for a 10-fold increase in airborne benzene levels; P = 0.009) and AluI (-1.00%; P = 0.027) methylation. Hypermethylation in p15 (+0.35%; P = 0.018) and hypomethylation in MAGE-1 (-0.49%; P = 0.049) were associated with increasing airborne benzene levels. LOI was found only in exposed subjects (4 of 73, 5.5%) and not in referents (0 of 23, 0.0%). However, LOI was not significantly associated with airborne benzene (P > 0.20).

To understand the role of the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein in leukemia, we must understand the normal functions of RBM15 and MKL. Here, we show a role for Rbm15 in myelopoiesis. Rbm15 is expressed at highest levels in hematopoietic stem cells and at more moderate levels during myelopoiesis of murine cell lines and primary murine cells. Decreasing Rbm15 levels with RNA interference enhances differentiation of the 32DWT18 myeloid precursor cell line. Conversely, enforced expression of Rbm15 inhibits 32DWT18 differentiation. We show that Rbm15 alters Notch-induced HES1 promoter activity in a cell type-specific manner. Rbm15 inhibits Notch-induced HES1 transcription in nonhematopoietic cells but stimulates this activity in hematopoietic cell lines, including 32DWT18 and human erythroleukemia cells. Moreover, the N terminus of Rbm15 coimmunoprecipitates with RBPJkappa, a critical factor in Notch signaling, and the Rbm15 N terminus has a dominant negative effect, impairing activation of HES1 promoter activity by full-length-Rbm15. Thus, Rbm15 is differentially expressed during hematopoiesis and may act to inhibit myeloid differentiation in hematopoietic cells via a mechanism that is mediated by stimulation of Notch signaling via RBPJkappa.","['Ma, Xianyong', 'Renda, Matthew J', 'Wang, Lin', 'Cheng, Ee-Chun', 'Niu, Chao', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Chi, Andrew S', 'Krause, Diane S']","['Ma X', 'Renda MJ', 'Wang L', 'Cheng EC', 'Niu C', 'Morris SW', 'Chi AS', 'Krause DS']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, P.O.

They are found exclusively in large, multidomain cytosolic proteins--often with other domains that belong to a variety of families--and are involved in a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological events. PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to solvent-exposed and extended C-terminal short fragments of membrane-associated proteins, such as receptors and ion channels. Most of what is known about the mechanisms of target binding by PDZ domains is inferred from studies that involve isolated recombinant PDZ domains and short synthetic peptides that represent the targets. These binary systems constitute an obvious oversimplification and disregard factors such as noncanonical modes of binding and enhanced affinity due to multimeric interactions mediated by clusters and oligomers of PDZ-domain-containing proteins. We have tested whether the interaction between a dimeric form of PDZ domain that mimics a functional dimeric guanine nucleotide exchange factor, PDZ-RhoGEF (PDZ-containing RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor) or LARG (leukemia-associated RhoA specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor), and a bivalent peptide that mimics the dimer of the plexin B receptor, could enhance the interaction between the two moieties. Peptide dimerization was achieved by cross-linking the N-terminal ends of peptides attached to Wang resin with poly(ethylene glycol) spacers (30-45 Angstroms in length). The interaction of dimeric PDZ domains with dimeric peptides resulted in an up to 20-fold increase in affinity compared to the simple binary system. This is consistent with the notion that multimerization of both receptors and PDZ-containing proteins might constitute an important regulatory mechanism.","['Paduch, Marcin', 'Biernat, Monika', 'Stefanowicz, Piotr', 'Derewenda, Zygmunt S', 'Szewczuk, Zbigniew', 'Otlewski, Jacek']","['Paduch M', 'Biernat M', 'Stefanowicz P', 'Derewenda ZS', 'Szewczuk Z', 'Otlewski J']","['Faculty of Biotechnology, Department of Protein Engineering, University of Wroclaw, Tamka 2, 54-137 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",IM,"['Dimerization', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbic.200600389 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2007 Mar 5;8(4):443-52. doi: 10.1002/cbic.200600389.,"['P01 HL48807/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 RR01081/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While these studies are mostly characterized by high dose rates, studies on populations exposed after the Chernobyl accident are in most cases characterized by low dose rates which are typical for occupational radiation protection. Here, data on more than 60,000 Ukrainian workers who participated in recovery operation works in Chernobyl in 1986-1987, more than 50,000 evacuees from the city of Prypyat and the 30 km zone, and about 360,000 residents of most contaminated territories are presented, which cover a period of observation from 1980 to 2004. For all cancers combined, statistically significant higher incidence rates than the national rates were found only for the recovery workers (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 117.2%, 95% confidence interval: 114.1-120.3), while those for the other investigated groups were lower. In all groups under study a significant increase of thyroid cancer incidence rates has been registered. This increase appears to be associated, at least partly, with the fallout of radioiodine, and it was found not only in children, but also in adolescents and adults. For example, the most significant excess was found for male recovery workers corresponding to a factor of 8.0. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the contribution of confounding factors such as an intensified thyroid screening after the Chernobyl accident could not be quantified, in the present study. For female recovery workers there was also an excess of breast cancer over the national rates (SIR 190.6%; 95% confidence interval: 163.6-217.7%). An analysis of the two other groups (evacuees and residents of contaminated territories) gave controversial results: relative to the local standard there was a statistically significant excess, while comparison with the national level did not substantiate this conclusion.","['Prysyazhnyuk, A', 'Gristchenko, V', 'Fedorenko, Z', 'Gulak, L', 'Fuzik, M', 'Slipenyuk, K', 'Tirmarche, M']","['Prysyazhnyuk A', 'Gristchenko V', 'Fedorenko Z', 'Gulak L', 'Fuzik M', 'Slipenyuk K', 'Tirmarche M']","['Research Centre for Radiation Medicine of AMS of the Ukraine, 53, Melnikov Str., 04050, Kiev, Ukraine. mfuzik@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00411-007-0093-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2007 Mar;46(1):43-51. doi: 10.1007/s00411-007-0093-4.

The virus induces B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, but this is counteracted in vivo by the immune response. Therefore, EBV-induced malignancies occur only when the immune response is impaired, e.g. in transplant recipients. The versatility of the viral gene expression strategy secures the consistent maintainance of the virus in healthy individuals. The viral proteins required for transformation render the cell immunogenic. Expression of the transforming genes leads to rejection, but these genes are not required for the maintenance of the viral genome. EBV is an important contributor for malignant transformation, even when it does not directly induce cell proliferation. Several mechanisms have been unravelled in EBV-associated tumors whereby the virus may modify the cellular phenotype and may influence the interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment.

GBM is considered to be an incurable tumor; tumor-free survival over 2 to 3 years is so rare that when it happens the original diagnosis is questioned. It is known that the type of the genetic mutation that a given GBM tumor harbors strongly influences the length of survival. However, most patients with GBM are receiving treatment without the preparation of a microarray gene map of their tumors. It is possible that the reason for a rare and exceptional long survival was not the treatment that the patient received, but the type of gene mutations that the tumor was exposed to. It is recognized that any therapeutic approach should ideally be evaluated against the background of all prognostic factors of each individual case, prominent among them the microarray gene map of the tumor. In practice, this is not easily achieved, while the patient is in need of, and is expecting, prompt therapy. Insurance companies do not reimburse the patient, or the clinical investigators, or their institutions for investigational diagnostic tests, or such treatment modalities. A temporary compromise is possible. The emergence of empirically administered treatment modalities with extraordinary efficacy has occasionally been recorded in the history of medical oncology. In some of these rare clinical trials, the control groups were discontinued (to the dismay of the statisticians), and the control patients were enrolled in the treatment groups so to escape doom and share the benefit of the unfolding high remission inductions experienced in the treatment group. Chemo-radiotherapy of Hodgkin's disease and cisplatin therapy of certain testicular carcinomas provided the first eclat examples. More recently, the rapidly approved and marketed imitanib mesylate for Ph-chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and the anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, and the not yet marketed double tyrosine kinase (ErbB1/2) inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb, GlaxoSmithKline) for a subgroup of breast carcinoma patients excelled. Thus, a clinical trial for GBM, but without precise pre-identification of all its prognostic factors, however with a great deal of evidence-based empirical expectations of benefits, for patients with rapid advarcement toward a fatal outcome, implying an element of urgency, appears to be justified.","['Sinkovics, J G', 'Horvath, J C']","['Sinkovics JG', 'Horvath JC']","[""Cancer Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital, Tampa, FL 33607, USA.

METHODS: MTT was used to test the cell growth, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to study the expression of VEGF mRNA and secretion of VEGF protein. RESULTS: DADS significantly inhibited proliferation of HL-60 cell and the inhibiting effects showed a dose (r > 0.9, P < 0.01) and time-dependent( r > 0.7, P < 0.01) manner. The expression of VEGF mRNA and secretion of VEGF protein could be down regulated by 0.625, 1.250, and 2.500 microg/mL DADS in HL-60 cells for 24,48 and 72 hours exposure and the effects also showed dose -dependence(r > 0.9, P < 0.01). The growth inhibition rates of DADS in HL-60 cells at three dosages for 24 hours were (8.19 +/- 3.34)%, (16.79 +/- 2.07)% and (21.30 +/- 2.72)%, those for 48 hours were (11.93 +/- 3.93)%, (22.81 +/- 2.31)% and (30.74 +/- 2.03)%, for 72 hours were (16.68 +/- 2.37)%, (28.54 +/- 3.26)% and (36.59 +/- 2.37)% respectively, The difference between the DADS-treated and untreated HL-60 cells was statistically significant (P < 0.01). There were also statistically significant differences among the three groups of different dosages (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: DADS can effectively inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells. DADS probably exerts its anti-leukemia effects by reducing the expression of VEGF mRNA and secretion of VEGF protein in HL-60 cells.","['Fan, Zi-Li', 'Qi, Zhen-Hua', 'Xie, Yi']","['Fan ZL', 'Qi ZH', 'Xie Y']","['Department of Hematology, Third Affiliated Hospital, Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)']",IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Sep;27(9):626-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The fibrinolytic activity was measured by chromogenic assay in NB4, SHI-1, K562, Jurkat and Raji cell lines. The protein expression of uPAR and Annexin II on cells surface and the mRNA expression of uPAR and Annexin II in cells of these cell lines were detected using flow cytometry and RT-PCR method respectively. RESULTS: The plasmin activity in supernatant was increased significantly after incubation of SHI-1 and NB4 cells with plasminogen. The plasmin activity of NB4 cells was obviously decreased by ATRA. The plasmin activity of NB4 and SHI-1 cells was significantly decreased by uPAR monoclonal antibodies. The expressions of uPAR and Annexin II and their mRNA in SHI-1 and NB4 cells were higher than that in other cell lines. ATRA could remarkably decrease the expressions of Annexin II and uPAR and their mRNA in NB4 cells. CONCLUSION: In leukemia cell lines, NB4 and SHI-1 cells have stronger fibrinolytic activity. Both Annexin II and uPAR on the leukemic cell membranes might contribute to this activity. The high fibrinolytic activity can be corrected by ATRA by down-regulating Annexin I and uPAR mRNA and protein expression in NB4 cells.","['Xie, Yan', 'Wang, Zhao-Yue', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Dai, Lan', 'Bai, Xia']","['Xie Y', 'Wang ZY', 'Zhang W', 'Dai L', 'Bai X']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Annexin A2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibrinolysis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/02/07 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Sep;27(9):588-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since most ATLL cells express both CD4 and CD25, these tumors might originate from CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells, based on their phenotypic characteristics. However, whether ATLL cells actually function as Treg cells has not yet been clearly demonstrated. Here, we show that ATLL cells from a subset of patients are not only hypo-responsive to T-cell receptor-mediated activation, but also suppress the proliferation of autologous CD4(+) non-ATLL cells. Furthermore, ATLL cells from this subset of patients secrete only small amounts of IFN-gamma, and suppress IFN-gamma production by autologous CD4(+) non-ATLL cells. These are the first data showing that ATLL cells from a subset of patients function as Treg cells in an autologous setting. The present study provides novel insights into understanding the immunopathogenesis of ATLL, i.e., how HTLV-1-infected cells can survive in the face of host immune responses. It also adds to our understanding of ATLL patients' severely immunocompromised state.","['Yano, Hiroki', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Inagaki, Atsushi', 'Ishii, Toshihiko', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Yano H', 'Ishida T', 'Inagaki A', 'Ishii T', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Mizuho-chou, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22536 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 May 1;120(9):2052-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22536.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00355472'],,,,,,,,,,

Galectins are a family of animal lectins that function both extracellularly (by interacting with cell surface and extracellular matrix glycoproteins and glycolipids) and intracellularly (by interacting with cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins) to modulate signaling pathways. We found that protease-resistant galectin-9 by modification of its linker peptide, hG9NC(null), prevented cell growth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. The suppression of cell growth was inhibited by lactose, but not by sucrose, indicating that beta-galactoside binding is essential for hG9NC(null)-induced cell growth suppression. hG9NC(null) induced cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdc25C and c-Myc, and apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP, c-IAP2 and survivin. Most of these genes are regulated by NF-kappaB, which plays a critical role in oncogenesis by HTLV-I. hG9NC(null) suppressed IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of NF-kappaB. Most importantly, treatment with hG9NC(null) (6.7 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally every day) reduced tumor formation from an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line when these cells were inoculated subcutaneously into SCID mice. Our results suggest that hG9NC(null) could be a suitable agent for the management of ATL.","['Okudaira, Taeko', 'Hirashima, Mitsuomi', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Makishi, Shoko', 'Tomita, Mariko', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Kawakami, Hirochika', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Takasu, Nobuyuki', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Okudaira T', 'Hirashima M', 'Ishikawa C', 'Makishi S', 'Tomita M', 'Matsuda T', 'Kawakami H', 'Taira N', 'Ohshiro K', 'Masuda M', 'Takasu N', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (LGALS8 protein, human)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (beta-galactoside)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Galactosides/metabolism', 'Galectins/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/06/27 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22534 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 May 15;120(10):2251-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22534.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;129(11):2762-3.

A simple revaccination schedule is warranted. METHOD: Fifty-nine children (age, 1-18 years) who had completed standard chemotherapy in accordance with Medical Research Council of United Kingdom protocols were recruited. All children received a single dose of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis, meningococcus C, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines > or = 6 months after completion of treatment. Antibody concentrations were measured before vaccination and 2-4 weeks and 12 months after vaccination. RESULTS: Prevaccination antibody levels were protective for all patients for tetanus (geometric mean concentration [GMC], 0.13 IU/mL; 95% CI, 0.1-0.17 IU/mL), for 87% for Hib (GMC, 0.5 microg/mL; 95% CI, 0.37-0.74 microg/mL), for 71% for measles (GMC, 301 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 163-557 mIU/mL), for 12% for meningococcus C (geometric mean titer [GMT], 1:2.9; 95% CI, 1:2.2 to 1:3.9), and for 11% for all 3 poliovirus serotypes. Revaccination resulted in a significant increase in levels of antibody to each vaccine antigen, with 100% of patients achieving optimal antitetanus antibody concentrations (defined as > 0.1 IU/mL; 1.5 IU/mL; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1 IU/mL), 93% achieving optimal antibody concentrations to Hib (defined as > 1.0 microg/mL; 6.5 microg/mL; 95% CI, 5.1-8.2 microg/mL), 94% achieving optimal antibody concentrations to measles (defined as > or = 120 mIU/mL; 2720 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 1423-5198 mIU/mL), 96% achieving optimal antibody concentrations to meningococcus C (defined as > or = 1:8; 1:1000; 95% CI, 1:483-1:2064), and 85% achieving optimal antibody concentrations to all the 3 poliovirus serotypes (defined as > or = 1:8). For the majority of subjects, protection persisted for at least 12 months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: Revaccination of children after standard chemotherapy is important, and protection can be achieved in the majority of these children using a simple schedule of 1 vaccine dose at 6 months after completion of leukemia therapy.","['Patel, Soonie R', 'Ortin, Miguel', 'Cohen, Bernard J', 'Borrow, Ray', 'Irving, Diane', 'Sheldon, Joanne', 'Heath, Paul T']","['Patel SR', 'Ortin M', 'Cohen BJ', 'Borrow R', 'Irving D', 'Sheldon J', 'Heath PT']","['Pediatric Oncology Department, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom. soonier@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxoid)', '0 (Haemophilus Vaccines)', '0 (Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Measles Vaccine)', '0 (Meningococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Mumps Vaccine)', '0 (Poliovirus Vaccines)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', '0 (Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', '0 (Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Acellular)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bacterial Capsules', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria Toxoid/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Measles Vaccine/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Meningococcal Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Mumps Vaccine/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Poliovirus Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Rubella Vaccine/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Vaccines/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Acellular/administration & dosage/immunology']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2006/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID40703 [pii]', '10.1086/511636 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2007 Mar 1;44(5):635-42. doi: 10.1086/511636.

This study investigates the antitumor effect of TP in human colon cancer cells (SW114) and myelocytic leukemia (K562), and elucidates the possible molecular mechanism involved. SW114 and K562 cells were treated with different doses of TP (0, 5, 10, 20, or 50 ng/ml). The cell viability was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Results demonstrated that TP inhibited the proliferation of both tumor cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. To further investigate its mechanisms, the products prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our data showed that TP strongly inhibited the production of NO and PGE(2). Consistent with these results, the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was up-regulated both at the mRNA level and the protein expression level, as shown by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. These results indicated that the inhibition of the inflammatory factor COX-2 and iNOS activity could be involved in the antitumor mechanisms of TP.","['Tong, Xiangmin', ""Zheng, Shui'er"", 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhu, Lifen', 'Lou, Yinjun', 'Yao, Hangping']","['Tong X', 'Zheng S', 'Jin J', 'Zhu L', 'Lou Y', 'Yao H']","['Institute of Hematologic Disease, Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China. yaohp2001@yahoo.com.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'China', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/genetics', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7270.2007.00254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2007 Feb;39(2):89-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7270.2007.00254.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we compared assays for quantitative CMV monitoring using blood cells and plasma. Four hundred and thirty-five consecutive samples from 29 patients with active CMV infection after allogeneic T-cell-depleted hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were tested in parallel using pp65 antigenemia and quantitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood cells and plasma (COBAS AMPLICOR CMV MONITOR). Although only 142 (53.1%) of 253 positive samples were concordantly identified by all three assays, the number of positive samples detected by each assay was not different and the quantitative values were correlated, provided that nucleic acid (NA) in plasma was isolated by COBAS AmpliPrep and not by the manual protocol. Six (18%) of 34 episodes with active CMV infection were not detected using CMV PCR in plasma; whereas in times of white blood cell aplasia or blast crisis of leukemia, samples with active CMV infection in plasma could not be detected using blood cells. We conclude that CMV monitoring in whole blood could be favorable compared with assays using plasma or blood cells alone.

The median blast count in the marrow was 30%. Conditioning regimen included total body irradiation (TBI) (10-12 Gy) in 115 patients. The donor was a matched donor (n=132) or a family mismatched donor (n=20). Twenty-two patients (15%) survive disease free, with a median follow-up of 14 years: 18 are off medications. The cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality is 40% and the cumulative incidence of relapse related death (RRD) is 45%. In multivariate analysis of survival, favorable predictors were chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (P=0.0003), donor other than family mismatched (P=0.02), donor age less than 34 years (P=0.02) and blast count less than 30% (P=0.07). Patients with all four favorable predictors had a 54% survival. In multivariate analysis of relapse, protective variables were the use of TBI (P=0.005) and cGvHD (P=0.01).

This study is an analysis of our experience with splenectomy performed for various hematological disorders between 1988 and 1997, outlining the indications, complications and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients who had splenectomy at our hospital during this period. One hundred and forty-three patients were treated for various hematological disorders at our hospital. These disorders included sickle cell disease (SCD) (100 patients), sickle ss-thalassemia (S-ss-thal) (13 patients), ss-thalassemia major (15 patients), Hb H disease (3 patients), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (5 patients), Gaucheras disease (2 patients), hereditary spherocytosis (1 patient), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (1 patient), thalassemia intermediate (2 patients) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1 patient). RESULTS: The indications for splenectomy in those with SCD and S-ss-thal were: hypersplenism (26 patients), major splenic sequestration crisis (23 patients), minor recurrent splenic sequestration crisis (50 patients), splenic abscess (12 patients), and massive splenic infarction (2 patients). Splenectomy in these patients was beneficial in reducing their transfusion requirements and its attendant risks, eliminating the discomfort from mechanical pressure of the enlarged spleen, avoiding the risks of acute splenic sequestration crisis, and managing splenic abscess. For those with thalassemia, total splenectomy was beneficial in reducing their transfusion requirements, while partial splenectomy was beneficial only as a temporary measure, as regrowth of splenic remnant in these patients subsequently led to increase in their transfusion requirements. Those with ITP, hereditary spherocytosis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia showed excellent response following splenectomy. There was no mortality, and the postoperative morbidity was 5.6%. CONCLUSION: With careful perioperative management, splenectomy is both safe and beneficial in a selected group of patients with hematological diseases.","['Al-Salem, A H', 'Naserullah, Z', 'Qaisaruddin, S', 'Al-Dabbous, I', 'Al Abkari, H', ""Al-Jam'a, A"", 'Al-Faraj, A', 'Yassin, Y M']","['Al-Salem AH', 'Naserullah Z', 'Qaisaruddin S', 'Al-Dabbous I', 'Al Abkari H', ""Al-Jam'a A"", 'Al-Faraj A', 'Yassin YM']","['Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, and Department of Internal Medicine, Qatif Central Hospital, Qatif, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,,,2007/02/06 09:00,2007/02/06 09:01,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/06 09:01 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['19-325 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.1999.325 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 1999 Jul-Aug;19(4):325-30. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.1999.325.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the emergence and rapid advancement of DNA microarray technologies, constructing gene expression profiles for different cancer types has already become a promising means for cancer classification. In addition to research on binary classification such as normal versus tumor samples, which attracts numerous efforts from a variety of disciplines, the discrimination of multiple tumor types is also important. Meanwhile, the selection of genes which are relevant to a certain cancer type not only improves the performance of the classifiers, but also provides molecular insights for treatment and drug development. Here, we use Semisupervised Ellipsoid ARTMAP (ssEAM) for multiclass cancer discrimination and particle swarm optimization for informative gene selection. ssEAM is a neural network architecture rooted in Adaptive Resonance Theory and suitable for classification tasks. ssEAM features fast, stable, and finite learning and creates hyperellipsoidal clusters, inducing complex nonlinear decision boundaries. PSO is an evolutionary algorithm-based technique for global optimization. A discrete binary version of PSO is employed to indicate whether genes are chosen or not. The effectiveness of ssEAM/PSO for multiclass cancer diagnosis is demonstrated by testing it on three publicly available multiple-class cancer data sets. ssEAM/PSO achieves competitive performance on all these data sets, with results comparable to or better than those obtained by other classifiers.","['Xu, Rui', 'Anagnostopoulos, Georgios C', 'Wunsch, Donald C 2nd']","['Xu R', 'Anagnostopoulos GC', 'Wunsch DC 2nd']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla, 65409-0249, USA. rxu@umr.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2007.1009 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2007 Jan-Mar;4(1):65-77. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2007.1009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific signals from the microenvironment in which mast cells reside can activate different molecular events that govern distinct mast cells responses. We previously demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) promotes IL-4 and IL-6 mRNA production and potentates FcepsilonRI-induced cytokine release in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. To further evaluate the effect of an oxidative microenvironment (which is physiologically present in an inflammatory site) on mast cell function and the molecular events responsible for mast cell cytokine production in this environment, we analyzed the effect of H(2)O(2) treatment on IL-4 production in bone marrow-derived, cultured mast cells. Our findings show that nanomolar concentrations of H(2)O(2) induce cytokine secretion and enhance IL-4 production upon FcepsilonRI triggering. Oxidative stimulation activates a distinct signal transduction pathway that induces Fyn/PI3K/Akt activation and the selective phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Moreover, H(2)O(2) induces AP-1 and NFAT complexes that recognize the IL-4 promoter. The absence of Fyn and PI3K or the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity demonstrated that they are essential for H(2)O(2)-driven IL-4 production. These findings show that mast cells can respond to an oxidative microenvironment by initiating specific signals capable of eliciting a selective response. The findings also demonstrate the dominance of the Fyn/p38 MAPK pathway in driving IL-4 production.","['Frossi, Barbara', 'Rivera, Juan', 'Hirsch, Emilio', 'Pucillo, Carlo']","['Frossi B', 'Rivera J', 'Hirsch E', 'Pucillo C']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biomediche, Universita di Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fyn protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/immunology/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*immunology/metabolism']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['178/4/2549 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.4.2549 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Feb 15;178(4):2549-55. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.4.2549.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that monomeric human IgE delayed spontaneous apoptosis of primary human neutrophils from atopic asthmatics in vitro. This effect was not dependent on FcepsilonRI cross-linking or autocrine release of soluble mediators; however, it was associated with increased expression of the antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein, retention of the proapoptotic molecule Bax in the cytoplasm, decreased release of Smac from mitochondria, and reduced caspase-3 activity.

They are effective immunosuppressants and anti-cancer agents and are prescribed increasingly to treat inflammatory diseases. Although their metabolism has been studied in detail, the optimal use of thiopurines has been guided predominantly by clinical experience and the precise molecular events that underlie their therapeutic activity have remained unclear. The aim of this article is to review some of the properties of the thiopurines and relate them to possible therapeutic mechanisms. In particular, I consider the contribution that DNA substitution by 6-thioguanine makes to their effects as well as some of the possible harmful reactions that DNA 6-thioguanine might undergo. CONCLUSIONS: The increased chemical reactivity of DNA 6-thioguanine underlies its cytotoxic effects and is an important contributor to the anti-leukaemic effects of the thiopurines.

While some small occupational studies have been performed using FISH in peripheral blood with promising results, some of the basic assumptions made in utilizing the FISH technique have not been fully explored. These include selection of the correct hematopoietic cell to assay (myeloid or lymphoid); selection of appropriate chromosomal markers and the sensitivity of peripheral blood FISH in detecting unbalanced genomic abnormalities. In this study, we performed a pilot 'validation' exercise utilizing the FISH technique and standard metaphase cytogenetics, comparing results in tandem pairs of peripheral blood with bone marrow cells, where clonal abnormalities arise. Samples were taken from patients with known chromosomal lesions associated with active leukemia. We carefully chose markers most frequently associated with leukemogen-inducing DNA damage and probes that have been utilized successfully in clinical practice. Ten de novo or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) patients underwent bone marrow cell karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Parallel peripheral blood samples were concommitently drawn and evaluated with FISH using the same probes. In six of eight paired samples treated with a 3-day phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation, typically used to assay lymphocytes and their progenitors, we detected abnormal clones. In one of the two remaining cases, we identified an abnormal clone in both bone marrow and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood, although at a level in the peripheral blood sample that would typically be reported as ""non-diagnostic"" for clinical purposes. These results suggest that use of FISH in PHA stimulated peripheral blood samples with probes commonly employed in t-AML evaluations (chromosomes 5q, 7q, 8, 11q) to detect cytogenetic abnormalities in peripheral blood represents a potentially promising though as yet, under-utilized approach for the occupational surveillance of workers exposed to leukemogens, especially if it could be linked to automated high-throughput assays for increased sensitivity.","['McDevitt, M A', 'Condon, M', 'Stamberg, J', 'Karp, J E', 'McDiarmid, M']","['McDevitt MA', 'Condon M', 'Stamberg J', 'Karp JE', 'McDiarmid M']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pilot Projects', '*Population Surveillance', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(07)00003-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 Apr 20;629(1):24-31. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.01.002.

Aiming at the design of anthracyclinone congeners capable of circumventing drug resistance, we synthesized naphthoindole containing derivatives of tryptophan and tryptamine. In doing so we adapted the traditional, gramine based approach for tryptophan and tryptamine synthesis. The most potent new compound, 3-(2-aminoethyl)-4,11-dihydroxynaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-dione (16), was equally cytotoxic (IC(50) within low micromolar concentrations) for human K562 leukemia and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines and their isogenic sublines with genetically defined determinants of altered drug response, that is, the expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein and loss of pro-apoptotic p53. Each of these mechanisms conferred resistance to the reference drug adriamycin. In contrast, naphthotryptamine 16, although less potent than adriamycin, was equally toxic for wild type cell lines and drug resistant counterparts. Moreover, at 3-5 microM 16 inhibited topoisomerase I in vitro. Thus, our novel naphthoindole based derivative of tryptamine gained new activities important for anticancer therapy, namely, suppression of topoisomerase I and the ability to overcome resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein expression and p53 dysfunction.","['Shchekotikhin, Andrey E', 'Dezhenkova, Lyubov G', 'Susova, Olga Yu', 'Glazunova, Valeria A', 'Luzikov, Yuri N', 'Sinkevich, Yuri B', 'Buyanov, Vladimir N', 'Shtil, Alexander A', 'Preobrazhenskaya, Maria N']","['Shchekotikhin AE', 'Dezhenkova LG', 'Susova OY', 'Glazunova VA', 'Luzikov YN', 'Sinkevich YB', 'Buyanov VN', 'Shtil AA', 'Preobrazhenskaya MN']","['Gause Institute of New Antibiotics, 11 B.

We put forward the hypotheses that simple concepts of set theory are valuable tool in order to verify the consistency of the available definitions of leukemia and lymphoma. Set theory is the branch of mathematics that leads with collections or sets of objects and has many applications. A set can be described by listing the properties that its members must have in order to belong to the set. We developed a group of organizational properties regarding cellular origin (designated [O] for origin), progression [P] and differentiation [D] of the malignant hematopoietic cells. We selected definitions of leukemia and lymphoma from medical literature and analyzed these definitions according to properties [O], [P] and [D]. Fourteen definitions were selected for analysis (seven of leukemia and seven of lymphoma). For each definition, we listed the properties that define leukemia and lymphoma as a set of hematological malignancies. The main property that characterizes the set of lymphomas was the lymphoid differentiation. This property was present in all seven definitions of lymphoma and should be regarded a necessary condition to define this neoplasia. Definitions of leukemia were not uniform and no common property was present in all of them. Altogether, these results demonstrate that current definitions do not permit a precise classification of hematological malignancy as leukemia or lymphoma.

Indeed, evidence from our group and others has suggested that two of the most clinically significant age-associated hematological conditions, namely, the diminution of the adaptive immune system and the elevated incidence of myeloproliferative diseases, have their origin in cell autonomous changes in the functional capacity of hematopoietic stem cells.","['Rossi, Derrick J', 'Bryder, David', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Rossi DJ', 'Bryder D', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. drossi@stanford.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Exp Gerontol,Experimental gerontology,0047061,,IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0531-5565(06)00447-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exger.2006.11.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Gerontol. 2007 May;42(5):385-90. doi: 10.1016/j.exger.2006.11.019.

Cationic liposomes have been shown to selectively target tumor endothelial cells, thus can potentially be used as a carrier for chemotherapy agents. In this study, cationic liposomes containing 20 mol% cationic lipid dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) were prepared and characterized. The cationic liposomal DOX showed 10.8 and 9.1 times greater cytotoxicity than control PEGylated liposomal DOX in KB oral carcinoma and L1210 murine lymphocytic leukemia cells, and 7.7- and 6.8-fold greater cytotoxicity compared to control neutral non-PEGylated liposomal DOX, repectively, in these two cell lines. Although cationic liposomal DOX had higher tumor accumulation at 30 min after intravenous administration compared to control liposomes (p<0.05), DOX uptake of these liposomes at 24h post-injection was similar to that of PEGylated liposomal DOX (p>0.05) and approximately twice the levels of the free drug and non-PEGylated liposomes. In a murine tumor model generated using L1210 cells, increased survival rate was obtained with cationic liposomal DOX treatment compared to free DOX (p<0.01), neutral liposome control (p<0.01), as well as PEGylated liposomes (p<0.05). In conclusion, the cationic liposomal DOX formulation produced superior in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity, and warrants further investigation.","['Wu, Jun', 'Lee, Alice', 'Lu, Yanhui', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Wu J', 'Lee A', 'Lu Y', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '13146-86-6 (didodecyldimethylammonium)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cations', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Compounding', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-5173(07)00015-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2007 Jun 7;337(1-2):329-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.01.003.

However, one of the limitations for their clinical use is P-gp-mediated drug resistance in cancer therapy. We hypothesize that modified anthracyclines will retain their anticancer activity, avert P-gp binding, and thus overcome P-gp-mediated drug resistance. Twenty-five daunorubicin analogues were synthesized with slight structure modifications in sugar moieties. Molecular docking, cytotoxicity, and P-gp inhibition assays in drug-resistant leukemia cells (K562/Dox) were used to identify several candidates that avert binding to multidrug-resistant protein (MsbA) and overcome drug resistance. Molecular docking showed that daunorubicin bound to the cavity between the intracellular domain (ICD) and nucleoside binding domain (NBD) of MsbA, which might be the ""entry site"" for the transport of its substrate. The molecular docking accurately predicted the substrates of multidrug-resistant protein. Several aspects are important for daunorubicin analogue binding to MsbA: (1) the substitution pattern and stereochemistry of the tetracyclic ring and sugar moiety; (2) the hydrogen bond donor or acceptor capability of the substituent at C'-3 and C'-4. Molecular docking, cytotoxicity, and P-gp inhibition assays identified ADNR, ADNR-1, and ADNR-3 for averting P-gp binding and overcoming drug resistance. The replacement of C'-3-NH2 with azido group in daunorubicin not only abolishes the hydrogen bond between the sugar moiety and MsbA but also completely changes the overall binding conformation, and thus averts the binding to MsbA. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that these compounds showed high sensitivity against drug-resistant cancer cells (K562/Dox) with P-gp overexpression. P-gp inhibition assay indeed confirms that these appropriately modified compounds avert P-gp binding and thus overcome P-gp-mediated drug resistance.","['Battisti, Robert F', 'Zhong, Yanqiang', 'Fang, Lanyan', 'Gibbs, Seth', 'Shen, Jie', 'Nadas, Janos', 'Zhang, Guisheng', 'Sun, Duxin']","['Battisti RF', 'Zhong Y', 'Fang L', 'Gibbs S', 'Shen J', 'Nadas J', 'Zhang G', 'Sun D']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Monosaccharides)', '0 (MsbA protein, Bacteria)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry/metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', '*Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Disaccharides/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Monosaccharides/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/mp060075v [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2007 Jan-Feb;4(1):140-53. doi: 10.1021/mp060075v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This trial was carried out in the hemotologica department of five hospitals throughout China, with hospitalized patients who suffered from acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML except M3 type) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL) , chronic myelogenous leukemia-blast (CML-blast) , totally 155 patients. Those with severely cardial, hepatic or renal disfunction or those who had ever treated with > or = 200 mg/m(2) idarubicin were excluded from the trial. All patients signed the letter of consent as required by the Ethics Committee of our government. In this study, 155 leukemia patients were randomly grouped into: 1. test group treated using domestic idarubicin, 2. control group using imported idarubicin. The acute myelogenous leukemia regimen included idarubicin 8 mg/m(2), dl -3 plus cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m(2), dl - 7 for 1-2 cycles. The regimen for acute lymphocytic leukemia was idarubicin 8 mg/m2, dl - 3; vincristine 2 mg/mr, dl; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, dl ; plus prednisone 60 mg/m(2),dl - 14 for 1-2 cycles. RESULTS: Clinical response rate of the tested group treated with domestic idarubicin and control group treated with imported idarubicin was 78. 1% (50/64) vs. 76.9% (50/65) without any statistically significant difference between the two groups(P >0. 05). Grade Ill - IV hematological toxicity rate of the domestic idarubicin group and imported idarubicin group was 74. 0% vs. 73. 1% , respectively (P = 0. 73). Drug-related death was observed in 3 of 77 patients in the domestic idarubicin group (3.9%) due to cerebral hemorrage or septic infection. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities in domestic idarubicin group and imported idarubicin group was 84. 4% vs. 79. 5% for nausea or vomiting, 70. 1% vs. 71. 8% for infection, 42. 9% vs. 41. 0% for mucositis, 33. 8% vs. 33. 3% for alopecia, 28.6% vs. 28. 2% for serum glutamicoxalacetic transaminase abnormalitis, 16. 9% vs. 10. 3% for cardiac toxicity, all without statistically significant differences between these two groups (P > 0. 05). Discontinuation of treatment due to non-hematological toxicity was not neccessary. CONCLUSION: Domestic idarubicin is comparable to imported counterpart in efficiency and safety for the treatment of acute leukemia. The most severe side effects of domestic idarubicin is hematological toxicity, which should be closely observed and treated in time, while its non-hematological toxicity is tolerable.","['Liu, Yan', 'Ke, Xiao-yan', 'Ma, Jun', 'Shen, Zhi-xiang', 'Zhang, Xiao-hong', 'Du, Xin', 'Zhao, Yi-ming', 'Lv, Jing-qiao', 'Zhan, Zhao-min', 'Zeng, Xiao-ying', 'Xu, Xiao-hua', 'Lu, Ze-sheng']","['Liu Y', 'Ke XY', 'Ma J', 'Shen ZX', 'Zhang XH', 'Du X', 'Zhao YM', 'Lv JQ', 'Zhan ZM', 'Zeng XY', 'Xu XH', 'Lu ZS']","['Department of Hematology, Third Hospital, Beijing Medical University, Beijing 100083, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucositis/chemically induced', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2007/02/06 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2006 Sep;28(9):706-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although egg-type chickens are susceptible to infection with ALV-J, the tumor incidence is very low, and on rare occasions the tumors observed are of the myeloid lineage. We recently described the isolation of an ALV (AF115-4) from commercial egg-type chickens suffering from myeloid leukosis. AF115-4 was initially identified as an ALV-J isolate based on PCR analysis of the long terminal repeat (LTR). However, further characterization of the viral envelope indicated that the virus is recombinant with subgroups B envelope and J LTR. Here we further characterize this recombinant virus at both the molecular and biological levels. We show that the AF115-4 isolate expresses a recombinant envelope glycoprotein encoded by a subgroup B gp85 region and a subgroup E gp37 region. The host range ofAF115-4 was analyzed using cells resistant to infection by subgroups A/B, J, or E; this shows that no ALV-J was present in the isolates obtained from the affected chickens. Additional antigenic characterization of AF115-4 using chicken sera specific for subgroups B or J indicated that no ALV-J was present in the samples examined. Inoculation of AF 115-4 into ALV-susceptible 1515 X 71 chickens resulted in the induction of lymphoid leukosis but not the expected myeloid leukosis affecting the commercial chickens. These results suggest that differences in the genetic makeup of the chickens from which AF115-4 was isolated and the line 1515 X 71 used in the present experiments may be responsible for the observed differences in pathogenicity. In addition, the results suggest that ALV-J continues to evolve by recombination, generating new viruses with different pathological properties.","['Lupiani, Blanca', 'Pandiri, Arun R', 'Mays, Jody', 'Hunt, Henry D', 'Fadly, Aly M']","['Lupiani B', 'Pandiri AR', 'Mays J', 'Hunt HD', 'Fadly AM']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poultry Diseases/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",2007/02/06 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1637/7656-053006R.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2006 Dec;50(4):572-8. doi: 10.1637/7656-053006R.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modifying p21 expression altered HIV-1 infection prior to changes in cell cycling and was selective for p21 since silencing the related CKIs, p27(Kip1) and p18(INK4C), had no effect on HIV-1. We show that p21 blocked viral infection by complexing with HIV-1 integrase and aborting chromosomal integration. A closely related lentivirus with a distinct integrase, SIVmac-251, and the other cell-intrinsic inhibitors of HIV-1, Trim5alpha, PML, Murr1, and IFN-alpha, were unaffected by p21.

All five resulted in placement of the feeding tube in the respiratory tract, four occurred despite the presence of cuffed endotracheal tubes. Three of the five patients had subsequent worsening of their respiratory status. One developed a pneumothorax, one developed pulmonary hemorrhage, and one developed an increased oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the pediatric intensive care unit may have characteristics that place them at an increased risk for misplacement of oral or nasal enteral tubes into the respiratory tract. Placement of enteral tubes into the respiratory tract may cause serious morbidity and possibly mortality. Checking the placement of enteral tubes with traditional methods does not prevent misplacement in the respiratory tree, and new techniques should be considered.","['Creel, Amy M', 'Winkler, Margaret K']","['Creel AM', 'Winkler MK']","['Department of Pediatric Critical Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Enteral Nutrition/*instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Intubation, Gastrointestinal/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Medical Errors/*prevention & control', 'Nose']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.PCC.0000257035.54831.26 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2007 Mar;8(2):161-4. doi: 10.1097/01.PCC.0000257035.54831.26.,,,,['Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2007 Mar;8(2):193-4.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A 13-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary level, university-based children's hospital. PATIENT: A 16-yr-old boy treated in the intensive care unit due to Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis, which developed after chemotherapy for nonlymphoblastic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: After admission to the intensive care unit, the patient required intubation (uneventful under ketamine and succinylcholine) and mechanical ventilation. On the 15th day of therapy, when his respiratory variables improved significantly, he was extubated. His cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation were continuously monitored. Several hours later, however, he required reintubation due to respiratory insufficiency. For intubation, precurarization with pancuronium, ketamine, propofol, and succinylcholine was used. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before and immediately after reintubation, serum potassium levels were measured. Two minutes after intubation, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, and finally cardiac arrest were recognized. An increase of serum potassium from 3.19 to 8.64 mmol/L was observed in arterial blood. The patient was immediately resuscitated with chest compressions, intravenous adrenaline, atropine, lidocaine, and sodium bicarbonate. Potassium values normalized within 30 mins. Further treatment in the intensive care unit was uneventful, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged to a hematology clinic. At present his mental and physical state is satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Succinylcholine may cause dangerous arrhythmias in septic and immobilized children. The alternative nondepolarizing agents should be used in such cases.","['Piotrowski, Andrzej J', 'Fendler, Wojciech M']","['Piotrowski AJ', 'Fendler WM']","['Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Pediatric University Hospital, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,"['0 (Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents)', 'J2R869A8YF (Succinylcholine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Heart Arrest/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/*chemically induced', '*Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents/*adverse effects', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Sepsis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Succinylcholine/*adverse effects']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.PCC.0000257103.96579.B2 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2007 Mar;8(2):183-5. doi: 10.1097/01.PCC.0000257103.96579.B2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling can cure leukemia but 75% of patients do not have a matched donor, one alternative source of stem cells includes full haplotype mismatched family members. As haploidentical transplantation must be extensively T cell depleted to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease, it cannot rely on donor T cells for the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Mismatched transplantation, however, triggers alloreactivity mediated by natural killer cells which is based upon 'missing self recognition'. RECENT STUDIES: Recent studies using preclinical murine models of haploidentical transplantation demonstrated that conditioning with alloreactive natural killer cells ablates the recipient immune system and leukemia cells. In the clinical setting of mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, donor versus recipient natural killer cell alloreactivity has been associated with better outcome, particularly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are transplanted in remission. SUMMARY: Given the benefits of natural killer cell alloreactivity, it is expected that it will encourage greater use of haploidentical transplants for the large numbers of leukemia patients without matched donors.","['Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Burchielli, Emanuela', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Ruggeri L', 'Mancusi A', 'Burchielli E', 'Aversa F', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. loredana.ruggeri@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Donor Selection', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Mice', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3280148a1a [doi]', '00001622-200703000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2007 Mar;19(2):142-7. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3280148a1a.,['1 P01 CA 100265-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,

In 19 patients, there was no evidence of myeloid chimerism because little or no myeloablation had been performed. Given this context, we sought factors associated with good long-term T-cell reconstitution. We found that all patients having undergone full myeloablation had donor myeloid cells and persistent thymopoiesis, as evidenced by the presence of naive T cells carrying T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). In 9 patients with host myeloid chimerism, sustained thymic output was also observed and appeared to be associated with gammac deficiency. It is therefore possible that the complete absence of thymic progenitors characterizing this condition created a more favorable environment for thymic seeding by a population of early progenitor cells with the potential for self-renewal, thus enabling long-term (> 10 years) T-cell production.","['Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina', 'Carlier, Frederique', 'Le Deist, Francoise', 'Morillon, Estelle', 'Taupin, Pierre', 'Gautier, David', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Caillat-Zucman, Sophie', 'Neven, Benedicte', 'Blanche, Stephane', 'Cheynier, Remi', 'Fischer, Alain', 'Hacein-Bey-Abina, Salima']","['Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Carlier F', 'Le Deist F', 'Morillon E', 'Taupin P', 'Gautier D', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Caillat-Zucman S', 'Neven B', 'Blanche S', 'Cheynier R', 'Fischer A', 'Hacein-Bey-Abina S']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 768, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphopoiesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/physiology', 'Time', 'Transplantation Chimera/*blood/immunology']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41585-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-029090 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4575-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-029090.

After radiotherapy this has been reported even more frequently but no explanation has been suggested apart from ""a complex interaction"". The hypothesis presented here is as follows: (1) Inadequate folinic acid rescue alone accounts for MTX-induced neurotoxicity. (2) Adequate folinic acid after MTX can prevent neurotoxicity. (3) Higher doses of MTX require a disproportionately higher dose of folinic acid than MTX to prevent toxicity. Doubling the dose of MTX has required tripling and quadrupling the folinic acid dose to prevent neurotoxicity. Assuming that central nervous system radiotherapy increases the cerebrospinal fluid levels of MTX and folinic acid proportionally, the folinic acid level may now not be enough to prevent neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity occurs when MTX is given after (but not before) radiotherapy, and can be prevented by appropriate doses of folinic acid. (4) There is no evidence that within the dose range currently being used, the administration of larger quantities of folinic acid to prevent neurotoxicity compromises prognosis. This hypothesis is supported by a large amount of published data. Critical reanalysis of studies that ostensibly contradict parts of the hypothesis showed that they, in fact, support it.","['Cohen, Ian J']",['Cohen IJ'],"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tiqwa, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. icohen@tau.ac.il""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Central Nervous System/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Folic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', '*Models, Biological', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*prevention & control', 'Risk Factors']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(06)00481-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2006.04.074 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2007;68(5):1147-53. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.04.074.

RESULTS: In observed group of patients, 34 develop secondary neoplasm after treatment of primary cancer. Analysis of parameters present at the treatment of first cancer, exposed two groups of patients at the special risk for secondary neoplasm. First are female patients treated for Hodgkin's disease at the age between 10 and 15 years, whose treatment included radiotherapy. Second group at special risk were male patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated at the age between 4.6 and 6.6 years of age. CONCLUSION: The risk groups identified in our study are similar to the results of studies that used more conventional approaches.

The SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) is a negative regulator of GM-CSF signaling, and inactivation of SHIP-1 in mice results in a myeloproliferative disease. Here, we report the effects of SHIP-1 expression on GM-CSF-dependent proliferation and colony formation of human hematopoietic cells. After retroviral-mediated transduction of SHIP-1 into CD34+ cells from cord blood of healthy newborns or peripheral blood of JMML patients carrying mutations in KRAS2 or PTPN11, we observed a reduction in GM-CSF-dependent proliferation and colony formation. An enzymatically inactive form of SHIP-1 (D672A) had no effect.

These mice developed splenomegaly and had a high incidence of MPD with extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and lymph nodes. Spleens also had increased dendritic and natural killer cell populations. In vitro analysis of the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from Tel-FLT3 transgenic mice showed a significant increase in the number of CFU-GM in the BM, and CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM in the spleen.

Lonafarnib has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Pgp-mediated drug efflux. On the basis of these findings, we examined the Pgp-inhibitory properties of tipifarnib and assessed its activity when combined with anthracyclines. The effects of tipifarnib on cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of Pgp-mediated anthracycline efflux were analyzed in two human leukemia cell lines overexpressing Pgp (CCRF-CEM and KG1a). Measurement of residual daunorubicin (DNR)-mediated fluorescence after incubation with DNR and tipifarnib demonstrated that tipifarnib significantly inhibited DNR efflux in CCRF-CEM with an IC(50) value less than 0.5 microM. Proliferation and apoptosis assays after exposure to DNR in the presence or absence of tipifarnib demonstrated synergistic inhibition of cellular proliferation, and induction of apoptosis with the combination of tipifarnib and DNR. Similar data was obtained with an enantiomer of tipifarnib that possesses no FTI activity.

In this study, we demonstrated that SDX-308 (CEP-18082), a novel analog of etodolac, has more potent cytotoxicity than R-etodolac against both MM cell lines and patient MM cells, including tumor cells resistant to conventional (dexamethasone, doxorubicine, melphalan) and novel (bortezomib) therapies. SDX-308-induced cytotoxicity is triggered by caspase-8/9/3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, followed by apoptosis. SDX-308 significantly inhibits beta-catenin/T-cell factor pathway by inhibiting nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, thereby downregulating transcription and expression of downstream target proteins including myc and survivin. Neither interleukin-6 nor insulin-like growth factor-1 protect against growth inhibition triggered by SDX-308. Importantly, growth of MM cells adherent to bone marrow (BM) stromal cells is also significantly inhibited by SDX-308. Our data therefore indicate that the novel etodolac analog SDX-308 can target MM cells in the BM milieu.","['Yasui, H', 'Hideshima, T', 'Ikeda, H', 'Ocio, E M', 'Kiziltepe, T', 'Vallet, S', 'Okawa, Y', 'Neri, P', 'Sukhdeo, K', 'Podar, K', 'Chauhan, D', 'Richardson, P G', 'Raje, N', 'Carrasco, D R', 'Anderson, K C']","['Yasui H', 'Hideshima T', 'Ikeda H', 'Ocio EM', 'Kiziltepe T', 'Vallet S', 'Okawa Y', 'Neri P', 'Sukhdeo K', 'Podar K', 'Chauhan D', 'Richardson PG', 'Raje N', 'Carrasco DR', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple-Myeloma Center, Department of Medical-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SDX 308)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '2M36281008 (Etodolac)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etodolac/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TCF Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'beta Catenin/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404561 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404561 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):535-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404561.

Although retroviral integration near the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) oncogene LIM-only protein 2 (LMO2) appears to be a common event, it is unclear why LMO2 was preferentially targeted. We show that of classical T-ALL oncogenes, LMO2 is most highly transcribed in CD34+ progenitor cells. Upon stimulation with growth factors typically used in gene therapy protocols transcription of LMO2, LYL1, TAL1 and TAN1 is most prominent. Therefore, these oncogenes may be susceptible to viral integration. The interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (IL2Rgamma), which is mutated in SCID-X1, has been proposed as a cooperating oncogene to LMO2. However, we found that overexpressing IL2Rgamma had no effect on T-cell development. In contrast, retroviral overexpression of LMO2 in CD34+ cells caused severe abnormalities in T-cell development, but B-cell and myeloid development remained unaffected. Our data help explain why LMO2 was preferentially targeted over many of the other known T-ALL oncogenes. Furthermore, during T-cell development retrovirus-mediated expression of IL2Rgamma may not be directly oncogenic. Instead, restoration of normal IL7-receptor signaling may allow progression of T-cell development to stages where ectopic LMO2 expression causes aberrant thymocyte growth.","['Pike-Overzet, K', 'de Ridder, D', 'Weerkamp, F', 'Baert, M R M', 'Verstegen, M M A', 'Brugman, M H', 'Howe, S J', 'Reinders, M J T', 'Thrasher, A J', 'Wagemaker, G', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Staal, F J T']","['Pike-Overzet K', 'de Ridder D', 'Weerkamp F', 'Baert MR', 'Verstegen MM', 'Brugman MH', 'Howe SJ', 'Reinders MJ', 'Thrasher AJ', 'Wagemaker G', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Staal FJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404563 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404563 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):754-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404563.

In this study, we demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of the p53 pathway with the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist nutlin-3 in Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines leads to effective apoptosis induction and sensitizes the cells to other anticancer drugs. Cells with mutant p53 are resistant to nutlin-3, but sensitive to geldanamycin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of heat shock 90 kDa protein (HSP90), indicating that HSP90 inhibition can induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. Conversely, cells with defects in the HSP90/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway expressing wild-type p53 are more resistant to geldanamycin, but still sensitive to nutlin-3. Our results suggest that selective activation of p53 by MDM2 antagonists as a single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics and/or inhibitors of p53-independent survival pathways may offer effective treatment options for patients with cHL. Importantly, because nutlins and HSP90 inhibitors are non-genotoxic agents, their use might offer a means to reduce the genotoxic burden of current chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Janz, M', 'Stuhmer, T', 'Vassilev, L T', 'Bargou, R C']","['Janz M', 'Stuhmer T', 'Vassilev LT', 'Bargou RC']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404565 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404565 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):772-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404565.

About 70% of cases showed the pro-B-ALL immunophenotype, whereas the remaining cases were common ALL and pre-B-ALL. MLL translocations were found in 79% of infants, involving MLL-AF4 (41%), MLL-ENL (18%), MLL-AF9 (11%) or another MLL partner gene (10%). Detailed analysis of Ig/TCR rearrangement patterns revealed IGH, IGK and IGL rearrangements in 91, 21 and 13% of infants, respectively. Cross-lineage TCRD, TCRG and TCRB rearrangements were found in 46, 17 and 10% of cases, respectively. As compared to childhood precursor-B-ALL, Ig/TCR rearrangements in infant ALL were less frequent and more oligoclonal. MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL-positive infants demonstrated immature rearrangements, whereas in MLL-AF9-positive leukemias more mature rearrangements predominated. The immature Ig/TCR pattern in infant ALL correlated with young age at diagnosis, CD10 negativity and predominantly with the presence and the type of MLL translocation. The high frequency of immature and oligoclonal Ig/TCR rearrangements is probably caused by early (prenatal) oncogenic transformation in immature B-lineage progenitor cells with germline Ig/TCR genes combined with a short latency period.","['Jansen, M W J C', 'Corral, L', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R', 'Schrappe, M', 'Schrauder, A', 'Marschalek, R', 'Meyer, C', 'den Boer, M L', 'Hop, W J C', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Basso, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Pieters, R', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Jansen MW', 'Corral L', 'van der Velden VH', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Schrappe M', 'Schrauder A', 'Marschalek R', 'Meyer C', 'den Boer ML', 'Hop WJ', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Pieters R', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Frequency', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404578 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404578 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):633-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404578.

We report that the ITS in human chromosome region 22q11.2 is, in the sequenced genome database, 101 tandem repeats of the sequence TTAGGGAGG. Using the primed in situ labeling (PRINS) technique and primers against the canonical telomeric repeat (TTAGGG), we illuminated telomeric sites for all chromosomes and an ITS locus at 22q11.2. Using the TTAGGGAGG sequence, we designed PRINS primers that efficiently and specifically illuminate the 22q11.2 ITS locus without illuminating telomeric and other ITS loci. The 22q11.2 locus has more repeat units than other ITSs loci enabling an unprecedented high detection frequency for this interstitial telomere locus. The 22q11.2 is associated with hot spots for disease-related chromosome breaks for multiple disorders, such as DiGeorge syndrome and chronic myeloid leukemia. We describe our findings that the ITS at 22q11.2 is in the same area of, and proximal to the common rearrangement region of multiple disorders. We suggest that the ITS might be involved in DNA repair processes in this area to protect the chromosome from more serious damage.","['Yan, J', 'Bouchard, E F', 'Samassekou, O', 'Chen, B-Z']","['Yan J', 'Bouchard EF', 'Samassekou O', 'Chen BZ']","['Service of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada. ju.yan@usherbrooke.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Repair', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['000097415 [pii]', '10.1159/000097415 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2007;116(1-2):29-37. doi: 10.1159/000097415.,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 S.

Although it reduces the total body burden of leukemia cells, the use of imatinib mesylate as a single agent may be accompanied by the evolution of resistance due mainly to the acquisition of point mutations. Imatinib has been combined with drugs that inhibit both the active and the inactive states of the p210Bcr-Abl kinase. These combinations have reduced but not completely eliminated the rate at which point mutations are acquired in the p210Bcr-Abl kinase. Thus, it is important to identify additional new inhibitors of the p210Bcr-Abl kinase. One possible method to prevent evolution of resistance is to simultaneously use multiple kinase inhibitors each with a different mechanism of action. To identify such a new class of inhibitors that could suppress the growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and prevent the evolution of cells that are resistant to imatinib, we screened two low-complexity libraries of compounds based on planar and linear scaffolds. These libraries were screened using a cell-based assay for molecules that suppress p210Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth. The application of this method resulted in the isolation of two new classes of drugs, both of which inhibited imatinib-resistant cells in the low micromolar range. Some of these drugs were potent inhibitors not only of Abl tyrosine kinase but also of the Src, Lyn, and Fyn tyrosine kinases.","['Lerma, Enrica I', 'Nguyen, Viet-Anh', 'Wang, Tao', 'Tipping, Alex', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Austin, David J', 'Deisseroth, Albert']","['Lerma EI', 'Nguyen VA', 'Wang T', 'Tipping A', 'Melo JV', 'Kufe D', 'Austin DJ', 'Deisseroth A']","['Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, 10835 Altman Row, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (methyl 4-(2-naphthylamino)-4-oxo-3-butynoate)', '0 (methyl 4-(4-phenoxyphenylamino)-4-oxo-3-butynoate)', '0 (methyl 4-(cyclohexylamino)-4-oxo-3-butynoate)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Alkynes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Furans/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-04-0307 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0307 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):655-66. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0307.

The role of glyco-Gag in MuLV replication has been unclear, since gPr80gag-negative Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) mutants are replication competent in vitro and pathogenic in vivo. However, reversion to the wild type is frequently observed in vivo. In these experiments, in vivo inoculation of a gPr80gag mutant, Ab-X-M-MuLV, showed substantially lower (2 log) initial infectivity in newborn NIH Swiss mice than that of wild-type virus, and revertants to the wild type could be detected by PCR cloning and DNA sequencing as early as 15 days postinfection. Atomic force microscopy of Ab-X-M-MuLV-infected producer cells or of the PA317 amphotropic MuLV-based vector packaging line (also gPr80gag negative) revealed the presence of tube-like viral structures on the cell surface. In contrast, wild-type virus-infected cells showed the typical spherical, 145-nm particles observed previously. Expression of gPr80gag in PA317 cells converted the tube-like structures to typical spherical particles. PA317 cells expressing gPr80gag produced 5- to 10-fold more infectious vector or viral particles as well. Metabolic labeling studies indicated that this reflected enhanced virus particle release rather than increased viral protein synthesis. These results indicate that gPr80gag is important for M-MuLV replication in vivo and in vitro and that the protein may be involved in a late step in viral budding or release.","['Low, Audrey', 'Datta, Shoibal', 'Kuznetsov, Yurii', 'Jahid, Sohail', 'Kothari, Nayantara', 'McPherson, Alexander', 'Fan, Hung']","['Low A', 'Datta S', 'Kuznetsov Y', 'Jahid S', 'Kothari N', 'McPherson A', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Codon, Nonsense', 'Fibroblasts/ultrastructure/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*physiology', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Models, Animal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/05/19 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01538-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01538-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Apr;81(8):3685-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01538-06.

Stiffening the carrier alone or in cooperation with roughing the surface lowered the two-dimensional affinity of interacting molecules by reducing the forward rate but not the reverse rate, whereas softening the carrier and roughing the surface had opposing effects in affecting two-dimensional kinetics. In contrast, the soluble antibody bound with similar three-dimensional affinity to surface-anchored P-selectin or PSGL-1 constructs regardless of carrier stiffness and microtopology. These results demonstrate that the carrier stiffness and microtopology of a receptor influences its rate of encountering and binding a surface ligand but does not subsequently affect the stability of binding. This provides new insights into understanding the rolling and tethering mechanism of leukocytes onto endothelium in both physiological and pathological processes.","['Wu, Li', 'Xiao, Botao', 'Jia, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Lu, Shouqin', 'Chen, Juan', 'Long, Mian']","['Wu L', 'Xiao B', 'Jia X', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu S', 'Chen J', 'Long M']","['National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.', 'National Microgravity Laboratory and Center for Biomechanics and Bioengineering, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.

Some of these features could be consequent to differential epigenetic transcriptional deregulation at AML1 targets imposed by AML1-MTG8 and AML1-MTG16, the fusion proteins deriving from the two translocations. Preliminary findings showing that these fusion proteins lead to transcriptional downregulation of AML1 targets, marked by repressive chromatin changes, would support this hypothesis. Here we show that combining conventional global gene expression arrays with the power of bioinformatic genomic survey of AML1-consensus sequences is an effective strategy to identify AML1 targets whose transcription is epigenetically downregulated by the leukemia-associated AML1-MTG16 protein. RESULTS: We interrogated mouse gene expression microarrays with probes generated either from 32D cells infected with a retroviral vector carrying AML1-MTG16 and unable of granulocyte differentiation and proliferation in response to the granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or from 32D cells infected with the cognate empty vector. From the analysis of differential gene expression alone (using as criteria a p value < 0.01 and an absolute fold change > 3), we were unable to conclude which of the 37 genes downregulated by AML1-MTG16 were, or not, direct AML1 targets. However, when we applied a bioinformatic approach to search for AML1-consensus sequences in the 10 Kb around the gene transcription start sites, we closed on 17 potential direct AML1 targets. By focusing on the most significantly downregulated genes, we found that both the AML1-consensus and the transcription start site chromatin regions were significantly marked by aberrant repressive histone tail changes. Further, the promoter of one of these genes, containing a CpG island, was aberrantly methylated. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a leukemia-associated fusion protein can impose a distinct epigenetic repressive signature at specific sites in the genome. These findings strengthen the conclusion that leukemia-specific oncoproteins can induce non-random epigenetic changes.","['Rossetti, Stefano', 'Hoogeveen, Andre T', 'Liang, Ping', 'Stanciu, Cornel', 'van der Spek, Peter', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta']","['Rossetti S', 'Hoogeveen AT', 'Liang P', 'Stanciu C', 'van der Spek P', 'Sacchi N']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. stefano.rossetti@roswellpark.org <stefano.rossetti@roswellpark.org>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (AML1-MTG16 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'CpG Islands', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/02/03 09:00,2007/02/24 09:00,['2007/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-8-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-38 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Feb 1;8:38. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-38.,,PMC1796549,,,,20070201,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of individuals with MBL progressing to a B-cell malignancy is unknown. Polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (PCBL) has not been systematically studied in the general population. METHODS: We obtained lymphocyte subset counts on 1,926 residential adults aged 40-76 years in a series of environmental health studies between 1991 and 1994. We then conducted two follow-ups in 1997 and 2003 on consenting participants with B-cell lymphocytosis, which included nine participants with MBL. To ascertain the clinical implications of MBL, we reviewed medical records and death certificates. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MBL was 0.57% (11/1,926): nine cases at baseline and two additional cases identified at follow-up. Two (19%) MBL cases subsequently developed a B-cell malignancy; MBL persisted in the remaining nine cases (81%). All PCBL cases where no clone emerged regressed to normal B-cell counts over the follow-up period. MBL was significantly more frequent in residents near a hazardous waste site than in the control populations (age-adjusted OR 6.2; 95%CI 1.1-36.2). CONCLUSION: MBL confers an elevated risk for developing a B-cell malignancy, although it occurs only in a minority of cases. PCBL is most often a transient state, but a monoclonal population can emerge and persist. Prospective studies are needed to distinguish stable from progressive forms of B-cell lymphocytosis and to clarify the etiologic role of environmental exposures.","['Shim, Youn K', 'Vogt, Robert F', 'Middleton, Dan', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Slade, Barbara', 'Lee, Kyung Y', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Shim YK', 'Vogt RF', 'Middleton D', 'Abbasi F', 'Slade B', 'Lee KY', 'Marti GE']","['Division of Health Studies, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA. yshim@cdc.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However, the relentless accumulation of CLL B cells in some patients indicates that anti-tumor immune responses are inefficient. Inhibitory receptors from the Ig-like transcript (ILT) family, such as ILT3 and ILT4, are crucial to the tolerogenic activity of antigen presenting cells. In this study, we examined the expression of ILT3 on CD5+ B cells obtained from 47 patients with CLL. Using flow cytometry and RT-PCR, we found that B CLL cells from 23 of 47 patients expressed ILT3 protein and mature ILT3 mRNA. ILT3 protein and mRNA were not found in normal B cells obtained from donors without CLL. Expression of ILT4 in normal and B CLL cells showed a pattern similar to ILT3. The frequency of ILT3 positive CLL B cells was higher in patients with lymphoid tissue involvement, suggesting that ILT3 may have prognostic value in CLL. Our findings indicate that expression of ILT3 and ILT4 on CLL B cells represents a phenotypic abnormality that may play a role in tolerization of tumor-specific T cells.","['Colovai, Adriana I', 'Tsao, Lawrence', 'Wang, Su', 'Lin, Hana', 'Wang, Chuan', 'Seki, Tetsunori', 'Fisher, Julie G', 'Menes, Manuel', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Suciu-Foca, Nicole']","['Colovai AI', 'Tsao L', 'Wang S', 'Lin H', 'Wang C', 'Seki T', 'Fisher JG', 'Menes M', 'Bhagat G', 'Alobeid B', 'Suciu-Foca N']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. aic4@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Using apoptosis analysis, we found that MGG is a potent inducer of apoptosis, but it has less effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Caspase-3 activation and subsequent apoptotic cell death in MGG-treated cells were partially blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK. MGG also inhibited the caspase-8 activity. To determine whether MGG-induced apoptosis is involved in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion, TNF-alpha secretion was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Unexpectedly, MGG significantly decreased the TNF-alpha secretion compared to the control. These results suggest that MGG-induced cytotoxicity have little relation with the secretion of TNF-alpha in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, MGG with rIFN-gamma synergistically increased nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse peritoneal macrophages.

Documentation of its use by medical professionals to treat basal cell carcinoma (BCC) dates from the early 19 century. Individuals who participated in a 1988 survey of home treatments for cancer indicated the sap of E. peplus was an effective cure for actinic lesions leading the investigators to suggest that this potential utility should be further explored in controlled clinical trials. The fractionation of the sap E. peplus using solvents of varying polarity yielded several macrocyclic diterpenes, many of which were found to have cytotoxic activity or the ability to influence cellular differentiation. Ultimately, ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) of PEP005, emerged as a promising potential new anti-cancer treatment.

Their activity has been compared with the well-known platinum-based anticancer agent cisplatin on a panel of acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines representing different French-American-British subtypes and in the Philadelphia-positive cell line K562. Both compounds suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, colony formation in methylcellulose with ID50 values of about 10-fold lower than that of the reference drug. After a short exposure (18 h), our compounds, but not cisplatin, were able to: downregulate the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, upregulate the proapoptotic molecule Bax and induce apoptosis, as determined by a strong induction of APO2.7 and phosphatidylserine exposure. Finally, after a 72-h exposure, both gold(III) dithiocarbamate derivatives determined modest cell cycle modifications, but induced DNA fragmentation in all myeloid cell lines tested. Altogether, our results indicate that these new gold(III) dithiocarbamate derivatives might represent novel potentially active drugs for the management of myeloid leukemia, able to combine cytostatic and apoptotic activity with reduced nephrotoxicity.","['Aldinucci, Donatella', 'Lorenzon, Debora', 'Stefani, Luigi', 'Giovagnini, Lorena', 'Colombatti, Alfonso', 'Fregona, Dolores']","['Aldinucci D', 'Lorenzon D', 'Stefani L', 'Giovagnini L', 'Colombatti A', 'Fregona D']","['Experimental Oncology 2, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy. daldinucci@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organogold Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', ""0 (dibromo(methyl N-(dithiocarboxy-kS,kS')-N-methylglicinato)gold(III))"", ""0 (dichloro(methyl N-(dithiocarboxy-kS,kS')-N-methylglicinato)gold(III))"", 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Organogold Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328011ae98 [doi]', '00001813-200703000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Mar;18(3):323-32. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328011ae98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have synthesized 5'-O-esters of cladribine and its parental nucleoside 2'-deoxyadenosine with chlorambucil (2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil and 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil, respectively) and compared some properties of the esters with regard to their potential use as antileukemic prodrugs. The 5'-O-ester bond showed no spontaneous hydrolysis at pH 7.4, but was susceptible to hydrolysis by porcine liver esterase and enzymes present in human lymphocyte lysate and blood plasma. Both 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil and 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil were taken up more avidly than their parental nucleosides by normal and malignant human lymphoid cells. 2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil was by an order of magnitude more toxic than 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil to human leukemic MOLT4 cells in culture. On the other hand, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil cytotoxicity did not exceed that of its parental 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine in MOLT4 cells, whereas 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil was considerably more cytotoxic than free chlorambucil in a variety of myeloid and lymphoid human malignant cell lines. Moreover, acute toxicity of 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil was lower than that of chlorambucil in mice. In summary, 2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil, but not 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-chlorambucil, shows promise for clinical utility as a chlorambucil prodrug and thus warrants a more detailed study in vivo.","['Kryczka, Tomasz', 'Kazimierczuk, Zygmunt', 'Kozlowska, Mariola', 'Chrapusta, Stanislaw J', 'Vilpo, Leena', 'Vilpo, Juhani', 'Stachnik, Krzysztof', 'Janisz, Monika', 'Grieb, Pawel']","['Kryczka T', 'Kazimierczuk Z', 'Kozlowska M', 'Chrapusta SJ', 'Vilpo L', 'Vilpo J', 'Stachnik K', 'Janisz M', 'Grieb P']","['Department of Experimental Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences Medical Research Center, Warsaw, Poland. tkryczka@cmdik.pan.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diffusion', 'Esters/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/*therapeutic use']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328011512d [doi]', '00001813-200703000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Mar;18(3):301-10. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328011512d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human neutrophils are highly granulated phagocytes, which respond to pathogens by exhibiting increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal degranulation. In a previous study, we observed that intracellular, nonphagosomal generation of ROS triggered by adherent bacteria induced ROS-dependent neutrophil apoptosis, whereas intraphagosomal production of ROS during phagocytosis had no effect. In the present study, we measured lysosomal membrane stability and leakage in human neutrophils and found that adherent, noningested, Type 1-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteria induced LMP rapidly in neutrophils. Pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium markedly blocked the early LMP and apoptosis in neutrophils stimulated with Type 1-fimbriated bacteria but had no effect on the late LMP seen in spontaneously apoptotic neutrophils. The induced lysosomal destabilization triggered cleavage of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bid, followed by a decrease in the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Involvement of LMP in initiation of apoptosis is supported by the following observations: Bid cleavage and the concomitant drop in mitochondrial membrane potential required activation of cysteine-cathepsins but not caspases, and the differential effects of inhibitors of cysteine-cathepsins and cathepsin D on apoptosis coincided with their ability to inhibit Bid cleavage in activated neutrophils. Together, these results indicate that in microbe-induced apoptosis in neutrophils, ROS-dependent LMP represents an early event in initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is followed by Bid cleavage, mitochondrial damage, and caspase activation.","['Blomgran, Robert', 'Zheng, Limin', 'Stendahl, Olle']","['Blomgran R', 'Zheng L', 'Stendahl O']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 85, Linkoping, Sweden. robert.blomgran@imk.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*metabolism', 'Cathepsins/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*immunology', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'Fimbriae, Bacterial/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/immunology', 'Oxidative Stress/*immunology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0506359 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0506359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2007 May;81(5):1213-23. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0506359.

Exposure of U937 and U266 cells to minimally toxic concentrations of UCN-01 and various statins (eg, lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin) dramatically increased mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Comparable effects were observed in other leukemia and myeloma cell lines as well as in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts but not in normal hematopoietic cells. Potentiation of UCN-01 lethality by lovastatin was associated with disruption of Ras prenylation and activation. These events were significantly attenuated by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) but not by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), implicating perturbations in farnesylation rather than geranylgeranylation in synergistic interactions. Coexposure to statins and UCN-01 resulted in inactivation of ERK1/2 and Akt, accompanied by JNK activation. U266 cells ectopically expressing JNK1-APF, a dominant negative JNK1 mutant, displayed significantly reduced susceptibility to lovastatin/UCN-01-mediated lethality. Moreover, transfection of U266 cells with constitutively activated H-Ras (Q61L) attenuated ERK1/2 inactivation and dramatically diminished the lethality of this regimen. Collectively, these findings indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors act through a Ras farnesylation-associated mechanism to induce signaling perturbations, particularly prevention of Ras and ERK1/2 activation, in UCN-01-treated cells, resulting in the synergistic induction of cell death.","['Dai, Yun', 'Khanna, Payal', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Khanna P', 'Chen S', 'Pei XY', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Protein Prenylation/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41567-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-047076 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4415-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-047076.

In 240 patients, we determined whether toxicities were related to 16 polymorphisms in genes linked to the pharmacodynamics of ALL chemotherapy, adjusting for age, race (self-reported or via ancestry-informative markers), sex, and disease risk group (lower- vs higher-risk therapy). Toxicities (gastrointestinal, infectious, hepatic, and neurologic) were assessed in each treatment phase. During the induction phase, when drugs subject to the steroid/cytochrome P4503A pathway predominated, genotypes in that pathway were important: vitamin D receptor (odds ratio [OR], 6.85 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-27.0]) and cytochrome P4503A5 (OR, 4.61 [95% CI, 1.11-19.2]) polymorphisms were related to gastrointestinal toxicity and infection, respectively. During the consolidation phase, when antifolates predominated, the reduced folate carrier polymorphism predicted gastrointestinal toxicity (OR, 10.4 [95% CI, 1.35-80.4]) as it also did during continuation (OR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.06-4.11]). In all 3 treatment phases, a glucuronosyltransferase polymorphism predicted hyperbilirubinemia (P = .017, P < .001, and P < .001) and methotrexate clearance (P = .028), which was also independently associated with hyperbilirubinemia (P = .026).

Major predictors of vascular events are increasing age and previous thrombosis; leukocytosis and high JAK2 V617F allele burden are currently being investigated for additional prognostic value in this regard. Myelosuppressive drugs can reduce the rate of thrombosis, but there is concern that their use raises the risk of transformation into acute leukemia. To tackle this dilemma, a risk-oriented management strategy is recommended. Low-risk patients should be treated with phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Cytotoxic therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, and the drug of choice is hydroxyurea because of its efficacy in preventing thrombosis and low leukemogenicity. Interferon-alpha should be reserved for selected categories of patients due to high cost and toxicity.

Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Matching serial sections of normal colonic epithelium and invasive CRCs (n = 32) were subjected to quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction specific to STAT3, cyclin D1, survivin, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, as well as immunohistochemistry. For STAT3 immunohistochemistry, two antibodies, recognising unphosphorylated (UP-) and phosphorylated (tyr705, P-) STAT3 were used. Ki-67 (MIB-1) staining was included as a proliferation marker. RESULTS: Compared with normal colonic epithelium, UP-STAT3 and P-STAT3 (p = 0.023 and 0.006) protein expression and expression of its associated targets cyclin D1, survivin and Bcl-xl were significantly (all p<0.001) increased in carcinoma. In carcinomas, STAT3 (p = 0.019) and Bcl-xl (p = 0.001) mRNAs were correlated with lymph node status. Moreover, nuclear P-STAT3 protein expression (active state) was associated with the expression of its target genes Bcl-xl (p = 0.038) and survivin (p = 0.01) as well as with Ki-67 (p = 0.017). By contrast, cytoplasmic UP-STAT was significantly linked to Bcl-xl mRNA (p = 0.024) and protein (p = 0.001) as well as to cytoplasmic survivin protein expression (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Both inactive (UP-STAT3) and active (P-STAT3) STAT3 proteins are markedly increased in invasive CRCs. This is associated with Bcl-xl and survivin induction, increased proliferation and lymph node metastasis.

The inner adrenocortical zone, which is in direct contact with the adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, produces dehydroepiandrostendione (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). These two androgens exhibit potential effects on neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and neuronal stem cell proliferation. Unlike the closely related sympathetic neurons, chromaffin cells are able to proliferate throughout life. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DHEA and DHEAS on proliferation of bovine chromaffin cells from young and adult animals. We demonstrated that graded concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor induced proliferation of chromaffin cells from young animals, whereas EGF had no effect. On the contrary, EGF increased the cell proliferation in cells from adult animals, whereas leukemia inhibitory factor was inactive. In both cases, DHEA decreased the proliferative effect induced by the growth factors. Surprisingly, DHEAS enhanced, in a dose-dependent-manner, the effect of growth factors on proliferation in cells from adult animals but not from young animals. Flutamide, ICI 182,780, and RU 486 had no effect on the action of DHEA or DHEAS on chromaffin cell proliferation.

Detection of changes in DNA methylation might serve as a pharmacodynamic endpoint to establish the biological activity of these agents and predict clinical response. We developed and validated a rapid, sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for determination of global DNA methylation (GDM) in vitro and in vivo. Ratios of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC) to the internal standard 2-deoxyguanosine (2dG) in mass signal were used to quantify GDM levels. The assay was validated in a linear range from 40 fmol to 200 pmol 5mdC. The intra-day precision values ranged from 2.8 to 9.9% and the inter-day values from 1.1 to 15.0%. The accuracy of the assay varied between 96.7 and 109.5%. This method was initially applied for characterization of decitabine-induced GDM changes in in-vitro-treated leukemia cells. Following exposure to 2.5 microM decitabine, GDM decreased to approximately 50% of the baseline value. The clinical applicability of this method was then demonstrated in bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with decitabine. Our data support the use of our LC-MS/MS method for clinical pharmacodynamic determination of changes in GDM in vivo.","['Liu, Zhongfa', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Blum, William', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Byrd, John', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Liu Z', 'Liu S', 'Xie Z', 'Blum W', 'Perrotti D', 'Paschka P', 'Klisovic R', 'Byrd J', 'Chan KK', 'Marcucci G']","['College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'B200GV71QM (5-methyldeoxycytidine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Deoxyguanosine/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkl1156 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkl1156 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(5):e31. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkl1156.

Two days later, she developed right inferior alveolar nerve paraesthesia. Radiographic imaging demonstrated cortical line absence around the developing lower right second and third permanent molars, and distal displacement of the lower right third molar. In addition, the cortical outline of the right inferior dental canal lacked clarity. Biopsy confirmed leukaemia recurrence demonstrating the Philadelphia chromosome.

However, LIF knockout mice containing the rat galanin 5' proximal promoter fragment (- 2546 to + 15 bp) driving luciferase responded to axotomy in the same way as control mice. Also, LIF had no effect on reporter gene expression in vitro, neither in the presence or absence of NGF, suggesting that other factors mediate an axotomy response from the galanin promoter. We then addressed the role of nitric oxide (NO) using NGF-deprived rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron cultures infected with viral vectors containing the above-mentioned construct, and also studied endogenous galanin expression in axotomized DRG in vivo. Blocking endogenous NO in NGF-deprived DRG cultures suppressed galanin promoter activity. Consistent with this, axotomized/NGF-deprived DRG neurons expressed high levels of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) and galanin. Further, using pharmacological NOS blockers, or adenoviral vectors expressing dominant-negative either for nNOS or soluble guanylate cyclase in vivo and in vitro, we show that the NO-cGMP pathway induces endogenous galanin in DRG neurons. We propose that both LIF and NO, acting at different promoter regions, are important for the up-regulation of galanin, and for DRG neuron survival and regeneration after axotomy.","['Thippeswamy, Thimmasettappa', 'Haddley, Kate', 'Corness, Jacquie D', 'Howard, Mark R', 'McKay, Jennifer S', 'Beaucourt, Stephanie M', 'Pope, Marion D', 'Murphy, David', 'Morris, Richard', 'Hokfelt, Tomas', 'Quinn, John P']","['Thippeswamy T', 'Haddley K', 'Corness JD', 'Howard MR', 'McKay JS', 'Beaucourt SM', 'Pope MD', 'Murphy D', 'Morris R', 'Hokfelt T', 'Quinn JP']","['Department of Veterinary Preclinical Science, Veterinary Faculty, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. tswamy@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axotomy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic GMP/*metabolism', 'Galanin/*metabolism', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*deficiency', 'Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/genetics', 'Neurons, Afferent/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sciatic Neuropathy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC4243 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04243.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2007 Feb;100(3):790-801. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04243.x.,"['G0701003/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four year follow-up].,535-44,"UNLABELLED: Targeted therapy with the use of imatinib mesylate is a recognized option for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We present results of a multicenter phase II study on the use of imatinib in chronic phase after failure to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Sixty patients (27 female, 33 male), median age 46 (range, 21-64), were included with hematologic relapse (n= 11), hematologic refractoriness (n=4), cytogenetic relapse/ /+65resistance (n=40) or intolerance to IFN-alpha (n=5). The median time from CML diagnosis was 39 months (range, 4-132), the median time of IFN-alpha therapy equaled 23 months (range, 1-78). Imatinib mesylate was administered at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 year. In patients who achieved major cytogenetic response (MCR) the therapy was continued until progression. Thirty-three (55%) patients achieved MCR after one year of treatment. At 4 years the cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response equaled 40% (95% CI, 29-56). Among 27 patients who did not achieve MCR at 12 moths, in 12 cases the study course was discontinued prematurely because of blast crisis (n=9), prolonged neutropenia (n=l), severe transaminases elevation (n=l) or incidental death not related to the study drug or disease (n=l). The probability of OS at 4 years equaled 82% (95% CI, 72-91) and was lower for patients with the disease duration >36 months and those with Sokal index > or =0.8. Among patients who achieved MCR, the probability of progression-free survival was 78% (95% CI, 69-85). Time to progression (cytogenetic, n=6; blast crisis, n=l) varied from 3-36 months. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate is characterized by good tolerance and allows achieving cytogenetic response in more than half of late chronic phase CML patients with failure of interferon therapy. However, the progression rate is substantial, which raises concern regarding the curative potential of monotherapy with imatinib in this group of patients.","['Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Konopka, Lech', 'Bober, Grazyna', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Ceglarek, Bernadeta', 'Kos, Kinga', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Kruzel, Tomasz', 'Kopera, Malgorzata', 'Bartkowska-Chrobok, Aleksandra', 'Pszenna, Ewa', 'Sikorska, Anna', 'Pienikowska-Grela, Barbara']","['Holowiecki J', 'Konopka L', 'Bober G', 'Giebel S', 'Ceglarek B', 'Kos K', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Kruzel T', 'Kopera M', 'Bartkowska-Chrobok A', 'Pszenna E', 'Sikorska A', 'Pienikowska-Grela B']","['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii i Transplantacji Szpiku Slaskiej Akademii Medycznej, Katowicach.']",['pol'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/02/01 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2006 Jun;115(6):535-44.,,,,,,,,,,,Ocena skutecznosci i bezpieczenistwa stosowania imatinibu mesylate u pacjentow z faza przewlekla przewleklej bialaczki szpikowej po niepowodzeniu leczenia interferonem 4 lata obserwacji.,,,,,,,

The diagnosis is confirmed by Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography; magnetic resonance imaging magnetic resonance angiography or arteriography can also be used.

In the current study, we explored the value of CD34, myeloperoxidase and nonspecific esterase (Leder) stains in differentiating GS from lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen cases of phenotypically confirmed GS were stained for CD34, myeloperoxidase and Leder stains. The same stains were performed in 16 malignant lymphomas as controls. The GS cases were also immunostained for CD3 and CD20 to detect the incidence of aberrant T and B lymphocyte expression. RESULTS: CD34 was expressed in 7 of the 15 cases of GS (46%). Myeloperoxidase was expressed in 10 of the 15 cases (66%), and Leder stain was positive in 9 cases (60%). All 15 cases had expression of at least one marker; 8 cases had expression of two markers and one case had expression of all 3 markers. None of the lymphomas showed expression of any of the three markers. Five cases (35%) of GS showed T cell antigen expression and 2 (14%) showed B cell antigen expression. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in cases of GS, the use of the combination of CD34, myeloperoxidase and Leder stains can help reach a definitive diagnosis, especially if lymphoma is difficult to exclude. Expression of B and T cell antigens in such lesions should not rule out the diagnosis of GS.","['Mourad, W', 'Kfoury, H', 'Al Husseini, H']","['Mourad W', 'Kfoury H', 'Al Husseini H']","['Department of Pathology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,,,2007/01/31 09:00,2007/01/31 09:01,['2007/01/31 09:00'],"['2007/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:01 [medline]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['21-287 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.2001.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2001 Sep-Nov;21(5-6):287-91. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2001.287.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many genetic defects underlying MDS and AML have been identified thereby allowing the development of new molecular-targeted therapies. Several new classes of drugs have shown promise in early clinical trials and may probably alter the standard of care of these patients in the near future. Among these new drugs are farnesyltransferase inhibitors and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors including FLT3 and VEGF inhibitors. These agents have been tested in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies such as AML and MDS. Most of the studies in MDS are still in early stages of development. The DNA hypomethylating compounds azacytidine and decitabine may reduce hypermethylation and induce re-expression of key tumor suppressor genes in MDS. Biochemical compounds with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity, such as valproic acid (VPA), have been tested as antineoplastic agents. Finally, new vaccination strategies are developing in MDS patients based on the identification of MDS-associated antigens.

These adducts are released from DNA to generate apurinic sites. Error-prone repair of this damage leads to the mutations that initiate breast, prostate, and other types of cancer. The reaction of E(1)(E(2))-3,4-Q with DNA forms the depurinating adducts 4-hydroxyE(1)(E(2))-1-N3adenine [4-OHE(1)(E(2))-1-N3Ade] and 4-OHE(1)(E(2))-1-N7guanine(Gua). These two adducts constitute >99% of the total DNA adducts formed. The E(1)(E(2))-2,3-Q forms small amounts of the depurinating 2-OHE(1)(E(2))-6-N3Ade adducts. Reaction of the quinones with DNA occurs more abundantly when estrogen metabolism is unbalanced. Such an imbalance is the result of overexpression of estrogen-activating enzymes and/or deficient expression of deactivating (protective) enzymes. Excessive formation of E(1)(E(2))-3,4-Q is the result of this imbalance. Oxidation of catechols to semiquinones and quinones is a mechanism of tumor initiation not only for endogenous estrogens, but also for synthetic estrogens such as hexestrol and diethylstilbestrol, a human carcinogen. This mechanism is also involved in the initiation of leukemia by benzene, rat olfactory tumors by naphthalene, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease by dopamine. In fact, dopamine quinone reacts with DNA similarly to the E(1)(E(2))-3,4-Q, forming analogous depurinating N3Ade and N7Gua adducts. The depurinating adducts that migrate from cells and can be found in body fluids can also serve as biomarkers of cancer risk. In fact, a higher level of estrogen-DNA adducts has been found in the urine of men with prostate cancer and in women with breast cancer compared to healthy controls. This unifying mechanism of the origin of cancer and other diseases suggests preventive strategies based on the level of depurinating DNA adducts that generate the first critical step in the initiation of diseases.","['Cavalieri, Ercole', 'Rogan, Eleanor']","['Cavalieri E', 'Rogan E']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 8198-6805, USA. ecavalie@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Lecture', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Estrogens, Catechol)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Quinones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism', 'Estrogens/chemistry/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Estrogens, Catechol/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens/metabolism/toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats']",2007/01/31 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/31 09:00'],"['2007/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1089/1/286 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1386.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Nov;1089:286-301. doi: 10.1196/annals.1386.042.,"['P01 CA49210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since epidemiologic data cannot provide an accurate assessment of risk at the doses used in imaging, risk estimates are currently made by fitting a linear response to intermediate and high dose data for cancer induction in radiation-exposed human populations. This method assumes a linear no-threshold (LNT) response and implies that no dose of radiation is safe. This assumption is not borne out by many laboratory studies of cancer-related endpoints that would suggest that the risk at low doses is much less than would be estimated from linear extrapolation from intermediate to high doses. It is also well recognised that the dose-response from many epidemiologic studies could equally well be fit by threshold models. Through the study of radiation-induced neoplastic transformation in vitro J-shaped dose-response curves for a variety of low LET radiations, including those used in low photon energy imaging, have been demonstrated. The relative risks calculated from this data compare remarkably well with those for breast cancer and leukemia incidence in radiation-exposed populations. From this it is concluded that the LNT hypothesis is likely to overestimate the risk of cancer induction by low photon energy imaging, at least for certain tumors.","['Redpath, J L']",['Redpath JL'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. jlredpat@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Diagnostic Imaging/*statistics & numerical data', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Photons', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",2007/01/31 09:00,2007/07/07 09:00,['2007/01/31 09:00'],"['2007/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncl449 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncl449 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2006;122(1-4):528-33. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncl449.

He developed thrombotic complications at multiple sites. Thrombophlebitis of the hemorrhoidal plexus became exacerbated and developed into critical cellulitis. Because the patient had no human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling, we considered an alternative donor. Because of the necessity for early neutrophil recovery to resolve the critical infection, we proceeded with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a microchimeric haploidentical sibling donor. We infused peripheral blood mononuclear cells directly into the patient without cryopreservation and thawing procedures. We aimed for the contaminating granulocytes to act as a granulocyte transfusion. Actually, the neutrophils increased to 1.6 x 10(9)/L on day 1, when the patient showed a temporary resolution of infection. Engraftment was achieved shortly after neutropenic nadir, and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been well controlled. Although the patient experiences extensive chronic GVHD, he has been well as an outpatient with a 90% Karnofsky performance status score. The leukemia has been in complete remission for more than 1 year. These findings suggest the clinical utility of a salvage therapy with allogeneic PBSCT from a microchimeric haploidentical donor to treat refractory leukemia concurrent with life-threatening infection.","['Muta, Tsuyoshi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Eto, Testuya', 'Oku, Seido', 'Nawata, Ryohei', 'Takase, Ken', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Arima, Fumito', 'Gondo, Hisashi', 'Okamura, Takashi', 'Shibuya, Tsunefumi']","['Muta T', 'Kato K', 'Eto T', 'Oku S', 'Nawata R', 'Takase K', 'Henzan H', 'Arima F', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura T', 'Shibuya T']","['Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. muta-t@matsuyama.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cellulitis/*etiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Infections', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Siblings', 'Thrombophlebitis/*etiology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",2007/01/31 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/01/31 09:00'],"['2007/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['B273R1V656418822 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.06168 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Jan;85(1):85-8. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.06168.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from studies worldwide consistently shows elevated levels of benzene biomarkers that are equivalent to 0.1-2 ppm benzene in ambient air, or even higher in the general population without occupational exposure to benzene (including children).

We reviewed the evidence and discussed possible explanations for these observations. It was concluded that while there is reason to suspect that benzene contributes significantly to elevated levels of biomarkers in the general population, there is growing concern that this cannot be definitively ascertained without concomitant consideration of the role of other factors such as metabolic polymorphisms and sources of biomarkers other than benzene, which have been insufficiently studied to date.

However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in granulopoiesis. Here, we report the expression of miRNAs in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients and cell lines during all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment by using a miRNA microarrays platform and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found upregulation of miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16-1, let-7a-3, let-7c, let-7d, miR-223, miR-342 and miR-107, whereas miR-181b was downregulated. Among the upregulated miRNAs, miR-107 is predicted to target NFI-A, a gene that has been involved in a regulatory loop involving miR-223 and C/EBPa during granulocytic differentiation. Indeed, we have confirmed that miR-107 targets NF1-A. To get insights about ATRA regulation of miRNAs, we searched for ATRA-modulated transcription factors binding sites in the upstream genomic region of the let-7a-3/let-7b cluster and identified several putative nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) consensus elements. The use of reporter gene assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that one proximal NF-kappaB binding site is essential for the transactivation of the let-7a-3/let-7b cluster. Finally, we show that ATRA downregulation of RAS and Bcl2 correlate with the activation of known miRNA regulators of those proteins, let-7a and miR-15a/miR-16-1, respectively.","['Garzon, R', 'Pichiorri, F', 'Palumbo, T', 'Visentini, M', 'Aqeilan, R', 'Cimmino, A', 'Wang, H', 'Sun, H', 'Volinia, S', 'Alder, H', 'Calin, G A', 'Liu, C-G', 'Andreeff, M', 'Croce, C M']","['Garzon R', 'Pichiorri F', 'Palumbo T', 'Visentini M', 'Aqeilan R', 'Cimmino A', 'Wang H', 'Sun H', 'Volinia S', 'Alder H', 'Calin GA', 'Liu CG', 'Andreeff M', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210186 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210186 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jun 14;26(28):4148-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210186.

Moreover, if dysregulated or mutated, these transcription factors cause the differentiation block observed in many myeloid leukaemias.

At the age of 7 years she had widespread hyperpigmented and hypopigmented skin lesions, and had developed medulloblastoma, which was treated with chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. At the age of 10 years she had developed acute myelocytic leukemia, M5. She was treated with chemotherapy including sibling bone marrow transplant with busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning. A three-generation family history identified no relatives with colonic carcinomas or polyposis. Investigations Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a sample of colonic adenoma. Staining for MLH1 and MSH2 was normal but was absent for MSH6. Direct sequencing of MSH6 was performed in the proband and both parents. Diagnosis Constitutional biallelic mutations in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 were identified in the proband. Both parents are carriers of one mutation. This is the first individual with biallelic MSH6 mutations reported with either medulloblastoma or acute myelocytic leukemia. Management Cascade genetic testing and colonoscopic screening for colorectal carcinoma has been offered to relatives carrying one mutation. The proband underwent panproctocolectomy and received adjuvant capecitabine. Identification of constitutional biallelic mismatch repair gene mutations allows the avoidance of chemotherapeutic agents likely to be ineffective and mutagenic in the context of the underlying mismatch repair deficiency. It is important to consider this diagnosis in children presenting with malignancy and abnormal skin pigmentation, even in the absence of a strong family history of tumors.","['Scott, Richard H', 'Mansour, Sahar', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathryn', 'Kumar, Devinder', 'MacSweeney, Fergus', 'Rahman, Nazneen']","['Scott RH', 'Mansour S', 'Pritchard-Jones K', 'Kumar D', 'MacSweeney F', 'Rahman N']","['Section of Cancer Genetics, Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, UK. richard.scott@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Clin Pract Oncol,Nature clinical practice.

However, a general consensus has not been reached, and several authors still retain RAEB-t as an MDS sub-entity. We re-evaluated our series of 74 patients classified as RAEB-t according to the FAB criteria by stratifying them into two subsets: patients with at least 5% peripheral blast (PB) cells but with BM blasts <20% (group I) and patients with BM blastosis between 20 and 30% and PBs <5% (group II). We found differences among the two groups regarding sex, haematological parameters at presentation (white blood cell and neutrophil counts, haemoglobin level) and frequency of infectious episodes during the course of disease. We did not find differences as to the frequency of acute myeloid leukaemia transformation, but a significant difference was evidenced as to survival (9.3 vs. 16 months in group I vs. group II, respectively; p = 0.02). Furthermore, at our institution, we compared the RAEB-t group I patients who, based on >5% PBs, should be included in the RAEB-II category according to the WHO criteria, with a group of 98 patients who were diagnosed as RAEB-II according to the WHO criteria. The findings showed that the aggregation of these two subsets appeared inappropriate, because patients of the two groups showed different clinical features and rates of acute transformation. In conclusion, the RAEB-t entity according to the FAB criteria, although including heterogeneous clinical patient subsets, should more likely be considered as an advanced stage of MDS, rather than a true acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Gentilini, Fabiana', ""D'Elia, Gianna Maria"", 'Levi, Anna', 'Natalino, Fiammetta', 'Frustaci, Annamaria', 'De Cuia, Maria Rosaria', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Latagliata R', 'Carmosino I', 'Gentilini F', ""D'Elia GM"", 'Levi A', 'Natalino F', 'Frustaci A', 'De Cuia MR', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Survival Analysis']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['000098957 [pii]', '10.1159/000098957 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2007;117(4):221-5. doi: 10.1159/000098957.

We investigated the role and the regulation of PDCD4 in the terminal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Expression of PDCD4 was markedly up-regulated during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation in NB4 and HL60 AML cell lines and in primary human promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) and CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in differentiation-resistant NB4.R1 and HL60R cells. Induction of PDCD4 expression was associated with nuclear translocation of PDCD4 in NB4 cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation but not in NB4.R1 cells. Other granulocytic differentiation inducers such as DMSO and arsenic trioxide also induced PDCD4 expression in NB4 cells. In contrast, PDCD4 was not up-regulated during monocytic/macrophagic differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in NB4 cells or by ATRA in THP1 myelomonoblastic cells. Knockdown of PDCD4 by RNA interference (siRNA) inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation and reduced expression of key proteins known to be regulated by ATRA, including p27(Kip1) and DAP5/p97, and induced c-myc and Wilms' tumor 1, but did not alter expression of c-jun, p21(Waf1/Cip1), and tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was found to regulate PDCD4 expression because inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 and wortmannin or of mTOR by rapamycin induced PDCD4 protein and mRNA expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that PDCD4 expression contributes to ATRA-induced granulocytic but not monocytic/macrophagic differentiation. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway constitutively represses PDCD4 expression in AML, and ATRA induces PDCD4 through inhibition of this pathway.","['Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Akar, Ugur', 'Steiner, Michael', 'Zorrilla-Calancha, Isabel', 'Tirado-Gomez, Maribel', 'Colburn, Nancy', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Berestein, Gabriel Lopez']","['Ozpolat B', 'Akar U', 'Steiner M', 'Zorrilla-Calancha I', 'Tirado-Gomez M', 'Colburn N', 'Danilenko M', 'Kornblau S', 'Berestein GL']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

We wanted to find optimal methods for cryopreservation of testicular tissue from pre-pubertal boys, modifying techniques developed for fetal and adult human testicular tissue cryopreservation. METHODS: Testicular tissue was collected from five pre-pubertal boys undergoing gonadotoxic treatment in a clinical programme. Two freezing protocols, originally developed for fetal and adult human testicular tissue, were applied for pre-pubertal testicular tissue cryopreservation. In both methods, 5% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was used as a cryoprotectant. The integrity of the tissue was investigated in non-frozen tissue cultured for 24 h and in cryopreserved-thawed tissue, using two different programmes. We also analysed frozen-thawed samples cultured for 24 h in comparison with untreated fresh fixed control tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-MAGE-A4, vimentin and CD34 monoclonal antibodies was performed in order to visualize and characterize the cryodamage of the different testicular cells and compartments. The structure of the tissue was evaluated using light microscopy. Qualitative control analysis was performed using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: No clear structural changes were observed in the fresh, fresh cultured and cryopreserved testicular tissue after using the protocol developed for adult testicular tissue. The programme earlier successfully used for human fetal testicular tissue cryopreservation caused more tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-pubertal testicular tissue from boys facing gonadotoxic treatment survives cryopreservation, can be cryobanked and hopefully used for fertility preservation. Slow programmed freezing with DMSO as a cryoprotectant is efficient in maintaining the spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and stromal compartment during freezing, thawing and tissue culture.","['Keros, Victoria', 'Hultenby, Kjell', 'Borgstrom, Birgit', 'Fridstrom, Margareta', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Hovatta, Outi']","['Keros V', 'Hultenby K', 'Borgstrom B', 'Fridstrom M', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Hovatta O']","['Karolinska Institute, Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Department of Clinical Science, Technology and Intervention, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

This study identified a novel, developmentally regulated interface between Eed and Mll, pivotal constituents of PcG and trxG pathways, respectively, in mouse brain. Although the PcG proteins Eed and EzH2 (Enhancer of Zeste protein-2) engaged in a common complex during neurodevelopment, Eed associated with the trxG protein Mll upon brain maturation. Comprehensive analysis of multiple histone modifications revealed differential substrate specificity of the novel Eed-Mll complex in adult brain compared with the developmental Eed-EzH2 complex. Newborn brain from eed heterozygotes and eed;Mll double heterozygotes exhibited decreased trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3, as well as hyperacetylation of histone H4. In contrast, adult hippocampus from Mll heterozygotes was remarkable for decreased acetylation of histone H4, which restored to wild-type levels in eed;Mll double heterozygotes. A physiological role for the Eed-Mll complex in adult brain was evident from complementary defects in synaptic plasticity in eed and Mll mutant hippocampi. These results support the notion that developmental regulation of complex composition bestows the predominant Eed complex with the chromatin remodeling activity conducive for gene regulation during neurodevelopment and adult brain function. Thus, this study suggests dynamic regulation of chromatin complex composition as a molecular mechanism to co-opt constituents of developmental pathways into the regulation of neuronal memory formation in adult brain.","['Kim, Se Young', 'Levenson, Jonathan M', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley', 'Sweatt, J David', 'Schumacher, Armin']","['Kim SY', 'Levenson JM', 'Korsmeyer S', 'Sweatt JD', 'Schumacher A']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Pathology and Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.

Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity in cell extracts and flow cytometry of propidium iodide-labeled cells. Pre-incubation with PGE(2) reduced camptothecin-induced caspase activity by 30% and apoptosis by 35%, respectively. Pharmacological data demonstrate that the EP4 receptor is responsible for mediating the protection from camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Pre-treatment of the cells with the EP4 antagonist (EP4A) prior to PGE(2) and camptothecin abolished the increased survival effect of PGE(2). Specific inhibition of the downstream of PI3 kinase or AKT/protein kinase but not protein kinase A prevents the observed increase in cell survival elicited by PGE(2).

The effects of TNFalpha and FasL on GrB expression were specifically mediated by p38MAPK (Mitogen-activated-protein-kinase) activation. Otherwise, TNFalpha and FasL stimulation led to radical oxygen species (ROS) generation and ASK1 (Apoptosis-signal-regulating-kinase-1) activation. Endogenous activation of ASK1 by either H2O2 or thioredoxin (Trx) reductase inhibition had the same effects as TNFalpha and FasL on GrB up regulation.

Infection of newborn inbred NMRI mice with Akv induced 35% plasma cell proliferations (PCPs) (consistent with plasmacytoma), 33% diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 25% follicular B-cell lymphomas and few splenic marginal zone and small B-cell lymphomas. Deleting one copy of the 99-bp proviral enhancer sequence still allowed induction of multiple B-cell tumor types, although PCPs dominated (77%). Additional mutation of binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor, Ets, Runx, or basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in the proviral U3 region, however, shifted disease induction to almost exclusively PCPs, but had no major influence on tumor latency periods. Southern analysis of immunoglobulin rearrangements and ecotropic provirus integration patterns showed that many of the tumors/cell proliferations induced by each virus were polyclonal. Our results indicate that enhancer mutations weaken the ability of Akv to induce mature B-cell lymphomas prior to the plasma cell stage, whereas development of plasma cell proliferations is less dependent of viral enhancer strength.","['Sorensen, Karina Dalsgaard', 'Kunder, Sandra', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Sorensen, Jonna', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Sorensen KD', 'Kunder S', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Sorensen J', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.F.

There are quantitative and qualitative differences in the antiviral cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response in ATL and HAM/TSP although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the HTLV-I Tax trans-activating protein is a transcriptional activator of CD40 ligand (CD40L), a critical regulator of dendritic cell maturation and adaptive immunity. Tax activates CD40L expression via a cyclosporin A insensitive pathway that is also independent of NF-kappaB. Although Tax upregulates CD40L gene expression, CD40L expression is absent in Tax-expressing HTLV-I-transformed cell lines via an epigenetic mechanism involving methylation. T lymphocytes cultured ex vivo from ATL patients, but not HAM/TSP or normal controls, exhibit a potent block in the induction of CD40L, but not CD69. However, the CD40L gene is not silenced by methylation in ATL patients, thus CD40L is downregulated by distinct mechanisms in HTLV-I-transformed cell lines and ATL patients.","['Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Janic, Branislava', 'Ramos, Juan C', 'Harrington, William J Jr', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Harhaj NS', 'Janic B', 'Ramos JC', 'Harrington WJ Jr', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10 Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FILIP1L protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'CD40 Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'DNA Methylation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00926-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.12.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 May 25;362(1):99-108. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.12.020.

In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), telomerase activity is increased in about 75% of patients. The aim of this study was to analyze whether B-CLL patients with telomerase-positive leukemic cells had naturally occurring, telomerase-specific T cells that might be utilized for immune-mediated lysis of autologous tumor cells. METHODS: Spontaneous T-cell immunity and cytotoxicity against hTERT was explored in B-CLL. Nineteen of 25 B-CLL patients (76%) expressed hTERT (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and 10 were selected for specific T-cell analysis against hTERT. RESULTS: The stimulation index (SI) of T cells from seven telomerase-positive patients stimulated with a 16aa hTERT peptide (611-626) loaded onto dendritic cells (DC) was 33.9 +/- 15.4 (mean SI +/- standard error of mean) and 13.2 +/- 5.6 against a Ras control peptide (p = 0.05), whereas the corresponding SI values for three telomerase-negative patients were 5.3 +/- 5.3 against the hTERT 611-626 peptide and 10.3 +/- 6.5 against the Ras peptide, respectively; and for three healthy controls, 5.4 +/- 0.9 against the hTERT 611-626 peptide and 4.5 +/- 1.0 against the Ras peptide (both not significant). Blocking experiments revealed that the specific responses were major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II restricted. DC pulsed with the hTERT-peptide generated MHC class I-restricted, hTERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in six of seven telomerase-positive patients; mean cytotoxicity of hTERT-stimulated T cells was 49.8% +/- 9.3% vs 13.1 +/- 2.9% for Ras-stimulated T cells (p < 0.05). In three of three telomerase-negative patients, no hTERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be expanded. CONCLUSION: Telomerase-positive B-CLL patients have spontaneously occurring cytotoxic hTERT-specific T cells. This antigen might be explored as a therapeutic vaccine in B-CLL.","['Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Palma, Marzia', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Choudhury, Aniruddha']","['Kokhaei P', 'Palma M', 'Hansson L', 'Osterborg A', 'Mellstedt H', 'Choudhury A']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Centre Karolinska, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (GV1001 peptide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Telomerase/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00658-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Feb;35(2):297-304. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically approved DNA methylation inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, can reverse p15INK4B promoter methylation, but widespread clinical use of these inhibitors is limited by their toxicity and instability in aqueous solution. The cytidine analog zebularine is a stable DNA methylation inhibitor that has minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated zebularine effects on p15INK4B reactivation and cell growth in vitro to investigate a potential role for zebularine in treating myeloid malignancies. METHODS: We examined the specific effects of zebularine on reexpression of transcriptionally silenced p15INK4B and its global effects on cell cycle and apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. RESULTS: Zebularine treatment of AML193, which has a densely methylated p15INK4B promoter, results in a dose-dependent increase in p15INK4B expression that correlates with CpG island promoter demethylation and enrichment of local histone acetylation. We observed enhanced p15INK4B induction following co-treatment with zebularine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A. Zebularine inhibits cell proliferation, arrests cells at G(2)/M, and induces apoptosis at dosages that effectively demethylate the p15INK4B promoter. Zebularine treatment of KG-1 cells and AML patient blasts with hypermethylated p15INK4B promoters also reactivates p15INK4B reexpression and induces apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Zebularine is an effective inhibitor of p15INK4B methylation and cell growth in human AML in vitro. Our results extend the spectrum of zebularine effects to nonepithelial malignancies and provide a strong rationale for evaluating its clinical utility in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.","['Scott, Stuart A', 'Lakshimikuttysamma, Ashakumary', 'Sheridan, David P', 'Sanche, Stephen E', 'Geyer, C Ronald', 'DeCoteau, John F']","['Scott SA', 'Lakshimikuttysamma A', 'Sheridan DP', 'Sanche SE', 'Geyer CR', 'DeCoteau JF']","['Department of Human Genetics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00654-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Feb;35(2):263-73. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we examined a potential renal toxic mechanism(s) of arsenic trioxide by using a toxicity-related gene and investigated potential treatments to reduce the renal toxicity of arsenic trioxide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arsenic trioxide was exposed to primary renal and HEK293 cells, and the gene-expression analysis was conducted using DNA microarray. Then, reactive oxygen species inhibitors or alpha-lipoic acid were added to HEK293 cells exposed arsenic trioxide and cell viability was determined. RESULTS: Expression of HMOX1 mRNA increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and translation of heme oxygenase 1 protein was also induced. Arsenic trioxide-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by reactive oxygen species inhibitors. Moreover, superoxide anion was detected in arsenic trioxide-treated HEK293 cells. alpha-Lipoic acid ameliorated arsenic trioxide-induced cytotoxicity and reduced superoxide anion production in HEK293 cells, whereas it had no effect in promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells and NB4 cells) and myeloma cells (KMS12BM cells and U266 cells). CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic trioxide-induced renal toxicity is strongly associated with the increased expression of HMOX1, and the cytotoxic mechanisms of arsenic trioxide involves reactive oxygen species production as well as another pathway. These preliminary results suggest that alpha-lipoic acid may be a suitable agent for prevention or treatment of arsenic trioxide-induced renal toxicity.","['Sasaki, Akira', 'Oshima, Yasuo', 'Fujimura, Akio']","['Sasaki A', 'Oshima Y', 'Fujimura A']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Imidazolines)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '4X87R5T106 (1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-Disulfonic Acid Disodium Salt)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', 'DEA5VW1N6R ((3,4-dihydroxyphenylamino)-2-imidazoline)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-Disulfonic Acid Disodium Salt/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Catecholamines/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazolines/pharmacology', 'Kidney Cortex/cytology/*drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Oxides/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Superoxides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thioctic Acid/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00655-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Feb;35(2):252-62. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question of whether BMSC from patients with hematological disorders have cytogenetic abnormalities is discussed controversially, some studies indicating that they are cytogenetically normal and others providing evidence of their aberrations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed standard and molecular cytogenetic analyses of both hematopoietic cells and BMSC from 31 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 18) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 13) and 7 healthy individuals. Mononuclear cells were isolated from fresh bone marrow aspirates at the time of initial diagnosis for cytogenetic analysis of hematopoietic cells (HC) and selection of BMSC. RESULTS: Clonal cytogenetic aberrations were observed in HC from 8 (44%) MDS and 8 (61%) AML patients. Cytogenetic analyses of BMSC were successfully performed in 27 of the 31 cases. Structural chromosomal aberrations, including t(1;7), t(4;7), t(7;9), t(7;10), t(7;19), t(15;17), and others, were detectable in BMSC from 7 of 16 (44%) MDS and 6 of 11 (54%) AML patients. The breakpoints of chromosomes in BMSC were typical for leukemia aberrations. Two patients showed clonal chromosomal markers. CONCLUSIONS: BMSC from MDS and AML patients show chromosomal abnormalities. Although the majority of cytogenetic aberrations in BMSC were not clonal and differed from chromosomal markers in HC from the same individual, detection of typical chromosomal changes in BMSC suggests enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in MDS/AML. This may indicate potential involvement of BMSC in the pathophysiology of MDS/AML.","['Blau, Olga', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Baldus, Claudia Dorothea', 'Thiel, Gundula', 'Serbent, Verena', 'Schumann, Elke', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang']","['Blau O', 'Hofmann WK', 'Baldus CD', 'Thiel G', 'Serbent V', 'Schumann E', 'Thiel E', 'Blau IW']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Charite-Campus Benjamin Franklin, University School of Medicine, Berlin, Germany. olga.marinets@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",2007/01/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/01/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00660-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Feb;35(2):221-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These leukemic cells can be grown in cell cultures and induced to terminal erythroid differentiation by a treatment with a specific chemical inducer such as N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide. MEL cells then re-enter their original erythroid program and differentiate along the erythroid pathway into non-dividing hemoglobin-rich cells resembling orthochromatophilic normoblasts. To deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying and erythroid differentiation and leukemia we monitored changes in protein expression in differentiating MEL cells. METHODS: In our effort to find new candidate proteins involved in the differentiation of MEL cells, we embraced a proteomic approach. Employing two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry, we compared protein expression in non-induced MEL cells with MEL cells exposed to N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide for 48 h. RESULTS: From 700 proteins spots observed, 31 proteins were differentially expressed. We successfully identified 27 of the differentially expressed molecules by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). CONCLUSION: In addition to proteins involved in heme biosynthesis, protein metabolism, stress defense and cytoskeletal organization, we identified 3 proteins engaged in regulation of cellular trafficking and 7 proteins important for regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression including 3 components of chromatin remodeling complexes. Many of the identified molecules are associated with erythroid differentiation or leukemia for the first time.

In conclusion, our data could suggest lineage-specific roles for TRIM22 during haematopoietic differentiation.","['Obad, Susanna', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Mechti, Nadir', 'Gullberg, Urban', 'Drott, Kristina']","['Obad S', 'Olofsson T', 'Mechti N', 'Gullberg U', 'Drott K']","['Department of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, BioMedical Centre, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

The number of WBC often increased by ten or more times as high as that of pretreatment, around 7 to 20 days after treatment with ATRA or arsenic trioxide. Usually, when number of WBC tended to peak, there was concomitance with down-regulation of promyelocytes, up-regulation of myelocytes and more mature neutrophils. The same trend of classification of BM was observed in most of the patients with APL to whom leukocytosis happened. Although the mechanism of leukocytosis has not been demonstrated clearly, so far the proliferation hypothesis by cytokines and rheological hypothesis by adhesion molecules were taken into consideration. Otherwise, hypothesis about more divisions of differentiated myelocytes induced by ATRA or arsenic trioxide remains unclear.

No data are available on the pharmacokinetics of IDA after a rapid HD intravenous infusion. An open phase II pharmacokinetic and clinical study was performed to evaluate antileukemic efficacy, IDA pharmacokinetics and to investigate the presence of IDA and its reduced metabolite idarubicinol (IDAol) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients treated with HD-IDA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia received Ara-C 3 g/m2 from days 1-5, idarubicin (HD-IDA) 40 mg/m2 as rapid intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 3 and subcutaneous G-CSF 5 microg/kg from day 7 until PMN recovery. Pharmacokinetics of IDA was evaluated after HD idarubicin administration in nine of these patients. CSF samples were collected in 15 patients at different times. IDA and IDAol concentrations were quantified by a validated HPLC assay described in detail elsewhere. RESULTS: Eleven patients (44%, 95% CI: 23-65%) achieved complete remission with median disease free survival for 6 months. After administration of HD-IDA i.v. bolus of 40 mg/m2, plasma level profiles of unchanged drug and IDAol were similar to those previously described after standard dose and measured with the same analytical method. The mean terminal half-life measured for IDA in this group of patients (14.9 h) was not significantly different from the mean value observed after standard dose (13.9 h, P=0.72). IDAol t1/2 was also similar after HD-IDA (46.2 h) and standard dose (39.4 h, P=0.79). Pharmacokinetic data reveal that in our series of patients IDA and IDAol clearances are significantly higher than those observed in patients treated with 12 mg/m2 of IDA but, although the administered dose (mg/m2) of the drug is 3.3 times higher, IDA exposure (measured in terms of AUC) is only 2.3 times and IDAol exposition 2.1 times greater. Furthermore, HD infusion resulted in a ratio between the AUC of parent drug and idarubicinol not different from the value observed with the standard-dose. IDA and IDAol were measurable only in 3 of the 15 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected. CONCLUSION: Responses observed in our series are comparable to those reported with other salvage regimens. The IDA exposure lower than expected may explain the safety of the single i.v. administration of 40 mg/m2 of IDA, combined with HD Ara-C, with a degree of myelosuppression equivalent to that reported with this agent administered in standard doses. Our data do not allow us to clearly attribute this behavior to a pharmacokinetic non-linearity since the baseline creatinine clearance, even within normal values, and patient age are significantly different in the two groups. Cerebrospinal fluid penetration was poor, reaching levels not considered as cytotoxic.","['Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Strocchi, Elena', 'Cafro, Anna Maria', 'Tresoldi, Elisabetta', 'Intropido, Liliana', 'Nichelatti, Michele', 'Marbello, Laura', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Camaggi, Carlo Maurizio', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Tedeschi A', 'Montillo M', 'Strocchi E', 'Cafro AM', 'Tresoldi E', 'Intropido L', 'Nichelatti M', 'Marbello L', 'Barate C', 'Camaggi CM', 'Morra E']","[""Department of Oncology/Hematology, Division of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore, 3, 20162, Milan, and Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Bologna, Italy. ale.ted@katamail.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0332-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 May;59(6):771-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0332-4.

Cloretazine significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors, including B16F10 murine melanoma in C57BL/6 mice, and H460 human lung carcinoma and WiDr human colon carcinoma in athymic nude CD1 mice. The inhibition of tumor growth by Cloretazine was dose dependent, increasing from 42.2 to 87% as the dose escalated from 100 to 150 mg/kg. Cloretazine showed equivalent efficacy but lower toxicity compared to cyclophosphamide in these models. The combination therapy, consisting of a single dose of 10 mg/kg Cloretazine plus five doses of 70 mg/kg fludarabine, given every other day intraperitoneally, significantly increased the long-term survival of BDF1 mice bearing the L1210 murine leukemia.

This prospective study investigates whether this protocol has an adverse effect on the medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB) and/or outer hair cells' (OHCs) function. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and their suppression by means of contralateral application of white noise were used for assessing the function of OHCs and the MOCB, respectively. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Oncology and otorhinolaryngology departments in a pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-six children treated with ALL-BFM-95. INTERVENTIONS: Before chemotherapy, a baseline audiologic evaluation with tympanogram, standard and extended high frequency, pure-tone audiometry, and DPOAEs in the absence and presence of white noise was performed in all children. This population was divided in three groups. In a first group (n = 12), the evaluation was repeated after four sessions of vincristine administration; in the second group (n = 12), after 8 sessions; and in the third group (n = 12), several months after completion of the protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: DPOAEs suppression by contralateral application of white noise. RESULTS: In the first and the third groups, we observed no changes in DPOAE amplitudes. Nevertheless, in the second group, the DPOAEs demonstrated significant decrease at 1416, 1685, 2002, and 2380 Hz. At baseline examination, all groups presented significant suppression at all frequencies. After eight vincristine sessions, instead of suppression, an increase of amplitudes was noted at 5 of 12 frequencies. Efferent-mediated DPOAE suppression reappeared in the third group at all frequencies (significant at 5 of 12 frequencies). CONCLUSION: ALL-BFM-95 seems to exert an early and reversible toxic effect on the MOCB, whereas its effects on OHCs are minimal and reversible. These minimal cochleotoxic and neurotoxic properties of ALL-BFM-95 might prove useful for research studies on the role of efferent innervation in hearing.","['Riga, Maria', 'Korres, Stavros', 'Psarommatis, Ioannis', 'Varvutsi, Maria', 'Giotakis, Ioannis', 'Papadas, Theodoros', 'Ferekidis, Eleftherios', 'Apostolopoulos, Nikolaos']","['Riga M', 'Korres S', 'Psarommatis I', 'Varvutsi M', 'Giotakis I', 'Papadas T', 'Ferekidis E', 'Apostolopoulos N']","['ENT Department, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece. mariariga@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Otol Neurotol,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",100961504,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Acoustic Stimulation/methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone/methods', 'Auditory Pathways/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gentamicins/adverse effects', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Olivary Nucleus/*drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/24 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MAO.0b013e31802ce486 [doi]', '00129492-200702000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Otol Neurotol. 2007 Feb;28(2):208-12. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0b013e31802ce486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its efficacy depends, in part, on the destruction of recipient acute myeloid leukemia cells by the conditioning regimen and, in part on their removal by donor immune cells contained in the graft (graft-versus-tumor effect). Due to regimen-related toxicities, the use of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has been restricted to younger patients in good condition. More recently, the introduction of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation following reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, which rely mainly on graft-versus-tumor effects for tumor cell eradication, has permitted extending hematopoietic cell transplantation to include older patients and those with medical comorbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: Early results with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission are encouraging, with 2-year survivals after hematopoietic cell transplantation ranging from 48 to 79% among studies. Further, retrospective studies have demonstrated similar outcomes in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission given either myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning. SUMMARY: Prospective studies are needed to define the place of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission, and to determine a role for consolidation chemotherapy before hematopoietic cell transplantation, if any.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Baron F', 'Storb R']","['University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3280168462 [doi]', '00062752-200703000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Mar;14(2):145-51. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3280168462.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to imatinib, treatment algorithms for chronic myeloid leukemia patients recommended stem cell transplantation for patients less than 50 years old who had a donor and could undergo stem cell transplantation. Other than stem cell transplantation, interferon was the only drug that could induce cytogenetic remissions in minority of patients. RECENT FINDINGS: After 5 years of follow-up, the rate of relapse with imatinib therapy continues to decrease, and the numbers of patients achieving a complete molecular response continue to increase. In addition, with a longer follow up, imatinib continues to be safe and easily tolerated. Recent studies have shown a survival benefit with imatinib. The use of imatinib before stem cell transplant did not have an effect on mortality or morbidity posttransplant. SUMMARY: Currently, imatinib is considered first line therapy in all patients with early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia with stem cell transplant reserved for patients who have disease resistant to imatinib therapy. Our aim is to review current recommendations for initial therapy of patients with early chronic phasechronic myeloid leukemia, current areas of controversy and future directions.","['Atallah, Ehab', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Atallah E', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

Management of these patients must take into account patient and leukemia-related factors in order to organize a comprehensive approach to treatment. Many new therapies are under study. RECENT FINDINGS: New molecular markers that represent mutations or gene overexpression have been identified including FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 and nucleophosmin, which will enhance our ability to more accurately prognosticate for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies and peptide vaccination with leukemia-associated antigens bring the hope of increasing the remission and cure rates for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The use of reduced-intensity conditioning blood or marrow transplantation is finding a broader role in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. SUMMARY: Patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia should be entered on clinical trials whenever feasible given the lack of consensus on the most effective treatment in this setting. Blood and marrow transplantation remains the only known curative therapy for these patients and the use of reduced-intensity conditioning blood or marrow transplantation offers the option of this approach to older and more infirm patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with biological activity in several hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome. The precise mechanism yielding benefit in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 5q- syndrome is not clear, but various molecular and pathogenic targets have been identified. Enhancement of cellular immunity through T-cell and NK-cell activation and suppression of inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic peptides upon lenalidomide treatment has been demonstrated in in-vitro models of myelodysplastic syndrome. Furthermore, lenalidomide induces a direct cytotoxic effect against 5q- clones in leukemia cell lines and enhances ligand-induced erythropoietin receptor signaling in erythroid progenitors. Clinical trials with lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndrome have supported the in-vitro evidence of karyotype-dependent activity by demonstration of a high frequency of cytogenetic and pathologic responses in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and deletion of chromosome 5q. Lenalidomide was approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with low to intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome and chromosome 5q deletion. SUMMARY: Lenalidomide is an active immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome with encouraging erythropoetic and cytogenetic remitting activity that is karyotype dependent.","['Melchert, Magda', 'Kale, Vishakha', 'List, Alan']","['Melchert M', 'Kale V', 'List A']","['Malignant Hematology Division, Department of Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine and the H.

In the decades that followed, other cytogenetic and molecular disease markers have been described and effectively incorporated into routine diagnostic tests. This review discusses how this process is unfolding in myeloproliferative disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2003, a karyotypically-occult FIP1L1-PDGFRA was reported in a subset of patients with blood eosinophilia and bone marrow mastocytosis; this mutation has since joined several other molecular markers for eosinophilic (e.g. PDGFRbeta- and FGFR1-rearrangements) and mast cell (e.g. KITD816V) disorders. In 2005, JAK2V617F was described in polycythemia vera and other BCR-ABL myeloproliferative disorders; the particular discovery has already had a major impact on current diagnostic approaches in polycythemia vera. These remarkable molecular discoveries are both redefining and reinforcing the diagnostic role of bone marrow histopathology. SUMMARY: Recent progress in the molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders calls for a paradigm shift in traditional diagnostics, which is based on subjective technologies or assignment to a 'consensus'-based ever-changing list of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Routine clinical practice might be better served by diagnostic algorithms that incorporate molecular disease markers, which complement histological impression.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Vardiman, James W']","['Tefferi A', 'Vardiman JW']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32801684d9 [doi]', '00062752-200703000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Mar;14(2):115-22. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32801684d9.,,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite having the same normal karyotype, adults with de-novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia who constitute the largest cytogenetic group of acute myeloid leukemia, are very diverse with respect to acquired gene mutations and gene expression changes. These genetic alterations affect clinical outcome and may assist in selection of proper treatment. Herein we critically summarize recent clinically relevant molecular genetic studies of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: NPM1 gene mutations causing aberrant cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin have been demonstrated to be the most frequent submicroscopic alterations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and to confer improved prognosis, especially in patients without a concomitant FLT3 gene internal tandem duplication. Overexpressed BAALC, ERG and MN1 genes and expression of breast cancer resistance protein have been shown to confer poor prognosis. A gene-expression signature previously suggested to separate cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients into prognostic subgroups has been validated on a different microarray platform, although gene-expression signature-based classifiers predicting outcome for individual patients with greater accuracy are still needed.

Several new studies validate the WHO classification. The International Prognostic Scoring System is very important to define patient risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and predict overall survival. Recent studies suggest International Prognostic Scoring System modifications and a group proposes a new WHO-based prognostic system.

Recent studies indicate that a common characteristic of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia is dysregulated expression of a key group of these Hox proteins. The purpose of this review is to outline recent progress in understanding the role that dysregulation of HOX-gene expression plays in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of recent studies correlate increased expression of HOXA-genes with poor prognosis cytogenetics in acute myeloid leukemia and mixed lineage leukemia. These studies determine that specific ABD HOXA-genes (HoxA7, 9 and 10) are dysregulated as a group. Many such studies also document co-overexpression of homeodomain proteins of the Meis and Pbx families in poor prognosis leukemia. This is of interest, since Meis and Pbx proteins are common DNA-binding partners for Hox proteins. SUMMARY: These findings suggest that a key characteristic of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia is increased, differentiation-stage inappropriate expression of the Abd HoxA proteins and their DNA-binding partners. Such results suggest that dysregulation of the 'Hox code' is important in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancy.","['Eklund, Elizabeth A']",['Eklund EA'],"['The Feinberg School at Northwestern University and Jesse Brown VHA Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA. e-eklund@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/physiology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32801684b6 [doi]', '00062752-200703000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Mar;14(2):85-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32801684b6.,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the activation of this tyrosine kinase might result in activation of downstream mediators such as STAT5, which would be detectable in bone marrow biopsies. We examined the expression of activated STAT5 (nuclear phospho-STAT5) in 73 bone marrow biopsies from patients with CMPDs [20 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 26 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), and 27 polycythemia vera] and 39 controls. We compared the results with the JAK2 mutational status and clinical parameters. The frequency of the JAK2 V617F was 73% (85% in PV, 65% in ET, and 65% in CIMF). All patients with the JAK2 V617F showed abnormal nuclear megakaryocytic phospho-STAT5 (nMEG pSTAT5) expression. In the JAK2 wild-type group, nMEG pSTAT5 was observed in 2/7 ET, and 3/9 CIMF patients. nMEG pSTAT5 staining was 100% sensitive and 88% specific for JAK2 V617F. Clinically, nMEG pSTAT5+ patients seemed to require cytoreductive therapy more often than those without nMEG p-STAT expression. pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry is a useful diagnostic test in bone marrow biopsies from suspected non-CML CMPD patients. It identifies most of the patients with the JAK2 V617F but also other JAK2 wild-type CMPD patients.

Two cases were CXCR3-positive, whereas 9 expressed CCR4, which are usually positive in ATLL.

The patients included 153 males and 200 females, aged 7 to 95 years, with a mean age of 64 years. In 277 cases, there was no known history of lymphoma. Seventy-six patients had a history of lymphoma, with the ocular adnexa being involved at relapse or with progression of the previously diagnosed lymphoma. The patients had marginal zone lymphoma (182 cases), follicular lymphoma (80 cases), mantle cell lymphoma (18 cases), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (13 cases), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (4 cases), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (2 cases), low-grade B cell, not subclassified (19 cases), precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma (3 cases), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (26 cases), and 1 case each of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, not subclassified, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified type, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, and Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type. Almost all marginal zone lymphoma patients (168 of 182, 92%) had primary ocular adnexal lymphoma. Fourteen marginal zone lymphoma patients (8%) had a prior history of lymphoma, usually arising in another extranodal site. Twenty-five of 80 (31%) follicular lymphoma patients had a prior history of lymphoma, usually arising in lymph nodes. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma almost always had a prior history of lymphoma or were known to have widespread disease at the time of diagnosis of ocular adnexal lymphoma. A subset of the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were associated with large destructive masses involving adjacent structures such as paranasal sinuses, raising the possibility that they may have arisen from one of the adjacent structures and involved the ocular adnexa by direct extension. The relatively high proportion of low-grade lymphoma, not subclassified, highlights the difficulty that may arise in distinguishing different types of low-grade lymphoma, particularly when biopsies are small and artifactually distorted. Ocular adnexal lymphoma is primarily a disease of older adults, with a slight female preponderance. Most lymphomas are low-grade B-cell lymphomas, with marginal zone lymphoma being by far the most common type. Marginal zone lymphoma typically involves the ocular adnexa primarily, whereas other types of low-grade B-cell lymphoma often involve the ocular adnexa secondarily. High-grade B-cell lymphomas only occasionally involve the ocular adnexa, and T-cell lymphoma, NK-cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma are only rarely encountered in this site.","['Ferry, Judith A', 'Fung, Claire Y', 'Zukerberg, Lawrence', 'Lucarelli, Mark J', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Preffer, Frederic I', 'Harris, Nancy L']","['Ferry JA', 'Fung CY', 'Zukerberg L', 'Lucarelli MJ', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Preffer FI', 'Harris NL']","['James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA. jferry@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Eye Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.pas.0000213350.49767.46 [doi]', '00000478-200702000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2007 Feb;31(2):170-84. doi: 10.1097/01.pas.0000213350.49767.46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study deals with the effects of hypoxia (0.1% oxygen) in vitro on Friend's murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, addressing the question of whether a clonal leukemia cell population comprise functionally different cell subsets characterized by different hypoxia resistance. To identify leukemia stem cells (LSC), we used the Culture Repopulating Ability (CRA) assay we developed to quantify in vitro stem cells capable of short-term reconstitution (STR). Hypoxia strongly inhibited the overall growth of MEL cell population, which, despite its clonality, comprised progenitors characterized by markedly different hypoxia-resistance. These included hypoxia-sensitive colony-forming cells and hypoxia-resistant STR-type LSC, capable of repopulating secondary liquid cultures of CRA assays, confirming what was previously shown for normal hematopoiesis. STR-type LSC were found capable not only of surviving in hypoxia but also of being mostly in cycle, in contrast with the fact that almost all hypoxia-surviving cells were growth-arrested and with what we previously found for HSC. However, quiescent LSC were also detected, capable of delayed culture repopulation with the same efficiency as STR-like LSC. The fact that even quiescent LSC, believed to sustain minimal residual disease in vivo, were found within the MEL cells indicates that all main components of leukemia cell populations may be present within clonal cell lines, which are therefore suitable to study the sensitivity of individual components to treatments.

We have examined the influence of Ras on normal human uncommitted myeloid subsets and show that expression of this oncogene strongly favors monocyte lineage selection in bipotential granulocyte/macrophage progenitors while inhibiting colony formation in other uncommitted subsets. Ras also promoted monocytic differentiation but not the proliferation of these cells. The mechanism through which Ras drives monocyte lineage selection was dependent on PKC activity and Ras was found to promote the expression, membrane translocation, and phosphorylation of conventional and novel PKC isoforms. We further show that Ras promoted the expression of the AGC kinase master regulator, PDK1, which maintains the stability and activity of PKC isoforms. Consistent with this, overexpression of PDK1 itself promoted monocyte colony formation and translocation of PKC. Overexpression of PDK1 was found to be a common feature of acute myeloid leukemia (45% of patients) and was closely associated with hyperphosphorylation of PKC. These data demonstrate that Ras is able to promote monocyte lineage selection via PKC and show for the first time the involvement of the kinase master regulator, PDK1, in both lineage specification and in human leukemia.","['Pearn, Lorna', 'Fisher, Janet', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Darley, Richard L']","['Pearn L', 'Fisher J', 'Burnett AK', 'Darley RL']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PDPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/*physiology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41572-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-047217 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4461-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-047217.

Different clinical behavior could relate to the ability of tumor cells to respond to surface (sIg)-mediated signals. Unmutated cases (U-CLL) have an increased ability to phosphorylate p72(Syk) in response to sIgM ligation compared to mutated cases (M-CLL). We now confirm and further investigate this differential signaling in a large cohort by [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization. Cases responding to sIgM ligation express higher levels of CD38, ZAP-70, and sIgM. However, CD38 does not influence signaling in vitro or associate with response in bimodal CD38-expressing cases. Similarly, ZAP-70 expression is not required for response in either U-CLL or M-CLL. Strikingly, partially or completely anergized sIgM responses from each subset can recover both sIgM expression and signal capacity spontaneously in vitro or following capping/endocytosis. This provides direct evidence for engagement of putative antigen in vivo. Signaling via sIgD differs markedly being almost universally positive in both U-CLL and M-CLL, with no association with CD38 or ZAP-70 expression. Downstream signaling pathways, therefore, appear intact in CLL, locating anergy to sIgM, mainly in M-CLL. Integration of differential isotype-specific effects mediated by (auto)antigen may determine tumor behavior.","['Mockridge, C Ian', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Wheatley, Isla', 'Neville, Louise A', 'Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Mockridge CI', 'Potter KN', 'Wheatley I', 'Neville LA', 'Packham G', 'Stevenson FK']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/*physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/immunology', 'Clonal Anergy/*genetics', 'Endocytosis/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin D/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/immunology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41568-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-11-056648 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4424-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-056648.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the signaling components involved in this activation and their relationship to the reported activation of Rac1. We found that both Rac1 and ERK activation in HCs are downstream of active Src and protein kinase C (PKC). Inhibition with toxin B showed that Rac1 plays no role in ERK activation in HCs. However, toxin B inhibited p60src and the Rac1-GEF Vav, demonstrating a positive feedback/activation of p60src by Rac1. Treatment with specific small interfering RNA for various PKC isoforms, or with PKC isoform-specific inhibitors, demonstrated a central role for PKCepsilon in the constitutive activation of Rac1 and ERK in HCs. PKCepsilon and active ERK were mutually associated and co-localized with mitochondria in HCs. Furthermore, active PKCepsilon was nitrated on tyrosine, pointing to a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism of activation. By being involved in activation of ERK and Rac1, PKCepsilon plays roles in both the survival of HCs and in the cytoskeletal dynamics responsible for the distinctive morphology and tissue homing of these cells. Our study therefore describes novel aspects of signaling important for the pathogenesis of hairy cell leukemia.","['Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Kamiguti, Aura S', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Cawley, John C', 'Zuzel, Mirko']","['Slupsky JR', 'Kamiguti AS', 'Harris RJ', 'Cawley JC', 'Zuzel M']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK L69 3GA. jslupsky@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (toxB protein, Clostridium difficile)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)60895-4 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2007.060557 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2007 Feb;170(2):745-54. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.060557.,,PMC1851876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These limitations may be overcome by the adoptive transfer of in vitro generated leukemia-reactive T cells. Although the potential clinical efficacy of this approach has been shown previously, lack of reproducibility of the procedure and the inability to show persistence and survival of the transferred T cells hampered further clinical application. The purpose of this study was to develop a new, broadly applicable strategy for the efficient generation and isolation of leukemia-reactive T cells with a better probability to survive and expand in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Myeloid and B-cell leukemias were modified into professional immunogenic antigen-presenting cells, and used to stimulate HLA-matched donor T cells. After two stimulations, responding donor T cells were isolated based on their secretion of IFN-gamma and tested for their capacity to recognize and kill the primary leukemia. RESULTS: Using one universal stimulation and isolation protocol for various forms of leukemia, T-cell populations containing high frequencies of leukemia-reactive T cells could reproducibly be generated and early isolated under mild stimulatory conditions. Isolated T cells still had high proliferative potential and their reactivity seemed to be restricted to cells of the patient's hematopoiesis. CONCLUSION: We here show a new robust procedure for the generation and isolation of leukemia-reactive T cells for adoptive transfer.","['Jedema, Inge', 'Meij, Pauline', 'Steeneveld, Esther', 'Hoogendoorn, Mels', 'Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'van de Meent, Marian', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Jedema I', 'Meij P', 'Steeneveld E', 'Hoogendoorn M', 'Nijmeijer BA', 'van de Meent M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, the Netherlands. i.jedema@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Cell Survival', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/instrumentation/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/therapy', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/636 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2093 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;13(2 Pt 1):636-43. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2093.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or esophageal cancer were treated every 21 days for two cycles. Regimen 1 was pemetrexed (200-600 mg/m(2)); regimen 2 was pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) with escalating carboplatin doses (AUC = 4-6). Both regimens included concurrent radiation (40-66 Gy; palliative-intent doses were lower). RESULTS: Thirty patients (18 locally advanced and 12 metastatic with dominant local symptoms) were enrolled, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1/2 (n = 8/21/1). All dose levels were tolerable for regimen 1 (n = 18: 15 NSCLC and 3 esophageal cancers) and regimen 2 (n = 12: all NSCLC). In regimen 1, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 esophagitis/anorexia) occurred (500 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 neutropenia (3 of 18 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity. In regimen 2, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 esophagitis) occurred (500 mg/m(2); AUC = 6); grade 3/4 leukopenia (4 of 12 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity. Four complete responses (2 pathology proven) and eight partial responses were observed. When systemically active chemotherapy doses were reached, further dose escalation was discontinued, and a phase II dose-range was established (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 5-6). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC = 5 or 6) with concurrent radiation is well tolerated, allows for the administration of systemically active chemotherapy doses, and shows signs of activity. To further determine efficacy, safety profile, and optimal dosing, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 30407 is currently evaluating this regimen in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.","['Seiwert, Tanguy Y', 'Connell, Philip P', 'Mauer, Ann M', 'Hoffman, Philip C', 'George, Christopher M', 'Szeto, Livia', 'Salgia, Ravi', 'Posther, Katherine E', 'Nguyen, Binh', 'Haraf, Daniel J', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Seiwert TY', 'Connell PP', 'Mauer AM', 'Hoffman PC', 'George CM', 'Szeto L', 'Salgia R', 'Posther KE', 'Nguyen B', 'Haraf DJ', 'Vokes EE']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, 5841 South Maryland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Glutamates/*administration & dosage', 'Guanine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pemetrexed']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/515 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1058 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;13(2 Pt 1):515-22. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1058.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a case-control population of 91 pediatric B-precursor ALL patients [42 relapsed within 4 years (cases) and 49 did not relapse (controls)], we used real-time reverse transcription-PCR to measure transcript levels for 20 genes relevant to chemotherapy with the five major drugs used to treat this disease, including asparaginase, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, prednisone, and vincristine. Results were confirmed in a separate case-control population of 26 patients. RESULTS: Only the human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) gene, encoding the major membrane transporter for methotrexate, showed a significant difference in median transcript levels between the 42 cases and the 49 controls (P = 0.0278, Wilcoxon test). Using cutoffs for hRFC expression levels (based on Akaike information criterion), there were statistically significant associations between hRFC transcripts and treatment relapse (P = 0.0052). hRFC-B, corresponding to the major hRFC transcript form in ALL, was also measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and was prognostic. The association between treatment relapse and hRFC levels was validated in a separate study population of 14 cases and 12 controls from an earlier case-control study (P = 0.0221). CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest the prognostic importance of hRFC gene expression to treatment outcomes in pediatric ALL. They validate our previous studies of hRFC transcriptional regulation in pediatric ALL and provide further compelling evidence for the critical role for methotrexate in the successful treatment of this disease.","['Ge, Yubin', 'Haska, Christina L', 'LaFiura, Katherine', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Linda, Stephen B', 'Liu, Mingjun', 'Thomas, Ronald', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Matherly, Larry H']","['Ge Y', 'Haska CL', 'LaFiura K', 'Devidas M', 'Linda SB', 'Liu M', 'Thomas R', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 110 East Warren Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/451 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2145 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;13(2 Pt 1):451-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2145.,['CA 76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highly related members of the mammalian FoxO transcription factor family, FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, represent one of several effector arms of PI3K-AKT signaling, prompting genetic analysis of the role of FoxOs in the neoplastic phenotypes linked to PI3K-AKT activation. While germline or somatic deletion of up to five FoxO alleles produced remarkably modest neoplastic phenotypes, broad somatic deletion of all FoxOs engendered a progressive cancer-prone condition characterized by thymic lymphomas and hemangiomas, demonstrating that the mammalian FoxOs are indeed bona fide tumor suppressors. Transcriptome and promoter analyses of differentially affected endothelium identified direct FoxO targets and revealed that FoxO regulation of these targets in vivo is highly context-specific, even in the same cell type.

The genetic immunogen was delivered with a gene gun and the proteins were injected intramuscularly together with the adjuvant AS02A. Immunizations were followed by experimental challenge with pseudotyped HIV-1 subtype A or B virus. In an initial experiment in which animals were challenged four weeks after the final immunization, all single modality and prime-boost vaccinations resulted in a significant level of protection as compared to control animals. There was a trend for DNA-alone immunization yielding the highest protection. In a subsequent study, a late challenge was performed 19 weeks after the final immunization. All groups having received the DNA vaccine, either alone or in combination with adjuvanted protein, exhibited strong protection against HIV replication. The subtype-specific protection against the experimental HIV challenge was significantly stronger than the cross-protection. Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed during immunization and after challenge, but without clear correlation to protection against HIV replication. The data suggest that either DNA or protein antigens alone provide partial protection against an HIV-1/MuLV challenge and that DNA immunization is essential for achieving very high levels of efficacy in this murine HIV-1 challenge model. While prime-boost combinations were more immunogenic than DNA alone, they did not appear to provide any further enhancement over DNA vaccine mediated efficacy. The DNA immunogen might prime low levels of CD8+ T cells responsible for virus clearance or possibly a yet unidentified mechanism of protection.","['Rollman, Erik', 'Mathy, Nathalie', 'Brave, Andreas', 'Boberg, Andreas', 'Kjerrstrom, Anne', 'van Wely, Cathy', 'Engstrom, Gunnel', 'Johansson, Susanne', 'Aperia, Kajsa', 'Eriksson, Lars E', 'Benthin, Reinhold', 'Ertl, Peter', 'Heeney, Jonathan', 'Hinkula, Jorma', 'Voss, Gerald', 'Wahren, Britta']","['Rollman E', 'Mathy N', 'Brave A', 'Boberg A', 'Kjerrstrom A', 'van Wely C', 'Engstrom G', 'Johansson S', 'Aperia K', 'Eriksson LE', 'Benthin R', 'Ertl P', 'Heeney J', 'Hinkula J', 'Voss G', 'Wahren B']","['Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (AIDS Vaccines)', '0 (ASO2A adjuvant)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",IM,"['AIDS Vaccines/*immunology', '*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Biolistics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Combinations', 'HIV Antibodies/blood', 'HIV Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*prevention & control', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lipid A/*analogs & derivatives/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*prevention & control', 'Saponins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(06)01196-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.057 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2007 Mar 1;25(11):2145-54. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.057.

Here we propose Aldara, a clinically used formulation of imiquimod, as an agent for augmenting immune responses to CML antigens. Our proposition is based upon 3 tenets: 1) Endogenous dendritic cells (DC) of CML patients, which are known to be derived from the malignant clone, express and present various leukemic antigens; 2) CML-antigen reactive T cell clones exist in the patient but in many situations are ineffectively stimulated to cause significant hematological responses; and 3) Antigen presentation by mature, activated DC, which endogenously express CML-antigens may endow the pre-existing ineffective T cell responses with ability to control CML progression. The practical use of Aldara as a localized activator of DC in the context of present day leukemic therapeutics, as well as various properties of this unique immune modulator will be discussed.","['Marleau, Annette M', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Riordan, Neil H', 'Ichim, Thomas E']","['Marleau AM', 'Lipton JH', 'Riordan NH', 'Ichim TE']","['Medistem Laboratories Inc, Tempe, Arizona, USA. annette.marleau@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/drug effects/immunology', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aminoquinolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/01/27 09:01,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:01 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-5-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-5-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2007 Jan 25;5:4. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-5-4.,,PMC1790884,,,,20070125,108,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070802'],,

Immature CD8alpha+ dendritic cells (DC) have good potential in GVHD treatment and immunological tolerance studies. To find a new way to prevent GVHD, not increasing the risk of leukemia recurrence, in this study, predominant CD8alpha+ immature DC were induced from murine bone marrow (BM) cells by 5 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus 20-ng/mL interleukin (IL)-4, 100-ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF) and 25-ng/mL Flt3L, and 97.09 of prepared DC were CD8alpha+ on day 3. These DC were identified as morphologically and phenotypically immature CD8alpha+ DC. The suppressive function was observed in vitro, and then in vivo on allo-BMT leukemia model. The prepared predominant immature CD8alpha+ DC were weak syngeneic lymphocyte stimulators and could suppress mixed leukocyte reaction in vitro. In vivo, they prevented the pathological changes of GVHD and prolonged the surviving time of allo-BMT leukemia mice. The effect showed a dose-effect relationship. 86.7% of allo-BMT plus 1 million predominant CD8alpha+ DC leukemia mice reached long-term survival. Although predominant immature CD8alpha+ DC had the function of GVHD suppression, they did not increase leukemia recurrence.

In immunocompromised patients, these fungi produce a relatively rapid, violently destructive, and highly fatal infection. Treatment approaches include both aggressive antifungal pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention. Unfortunately, even with optimal therapy, morbidity and mortality rates remain relatively high. As failure rates are elevated with commercial antifungals, new treatment options are needed. Posaconazole is an orally available, extended-spectrum triazole antifungal being investigated in phase III clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections, including zygomycosis. We report the case of a 26-year-old Vietnamese man with a medical history of acute lymphocytic leukemia who had undergone consolidation chemotherapy and had neutropenic fever when he came to the emergency department. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and caspofungin. Two weeks into his admission, however, abscesses in the pelvis, prostate, and musculature surrounding the hip were detected radiographically; these abscesses eventually cultured for Mucor sp. Disseminated zygomycosis was diagnosed. Caspofungin was immediately discontinued, and high-dose liposomal amphotericin B 10 mg/kg/day was begun. Over the next month, infection spread to the right lung, left kidney, middle thoracic spine, and epidural space. As a result, oral posaconazole 200 mg 4 times/day was added to the liposomal amphotericin B. Significant clinical, hematologic, mycologic, and radiologic improvements were demonstrated as early as 10 days after start of posaconazole therapy and continued through 41 days of inpatient treatment. Liposomal amphotericin B was discontinued after 3 weeks of posaconazole, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 92 receiving oral posaconazole, with no major adverse events reported. Five months after discharge, the patient had no evidence of fungal disease recurrence or progression. Posaconazole appears to be a well-tolerated and effective salvage treatment for zygomycosis, including disseminated disease.","['Page, Robert Lee 2nd', 'Schwiesow, Joshua', 'Hilts, Alexandra']","['Page RL 2nd', 'Schwiesow J', 'Hilts A']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA. robert.page@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mucor/isolation & purification', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Zygomycosis/*drug therapy']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.27.2.290 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2007 Feb;27(2):290-8. doi: 10.1592/phco.27.2.290.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in patients submitted to chemotherapy and FN, from the ages of 3 to 21 years old, with solid tumors, acute lymphoid leukemia, and lymphomas without comorbidities and treated as outpatient with oral GA. Safety and adverse effects were monitored. RESULTS: We evaluated 108 patients with 201 episodes of FN. The average age was 10.8 years, 64.8% of the patients were male. Osteosarcoma accounted for 22% of the episodes, rhabdomyosarcoma for 13%, acute lymphoid leukemia, lymphomas and Ewing sarcoma, for 11% each.

The role of environmental exposure to pesticides in carcinogenesis, although strongly postulated, is still unknown. Pesticides have been used since the early days of modern agriculture. They are biologically active compounds, which may pose health risk during or after their use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological studies focused on childhood cancer and exposure to pesticides, conducted over the last seven years, were identified through searching PUBMED, MEDLINE and EBSCO literature bases. From each study, the following information was abstracted: type of cancer, type of exposure, study design, risk estimate, and study population. This review will try to answer the question on whether any further progress in epidemiology of childhood cancer due to pesticide exposure has been made. RESULTS: Leukemia, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and neuroblastoma are mentioned as potentially associated with pesticide exposure among children. Despite an increasing evidence in support of this finding, it is still limited because of the weakness of research methodology. The substantial weak points of numerous epidemiological studies of pesticide-related health effects are problems faced in exposure assessment, small numbers of exposed subjects, a limited number of studies focused on the majority of cancers, and difficulties in estimating critical windows of exposure. CONCLUSION: In the light of existing, although still limited evidence of adverse effects of pesticide exposure, it is necessary to reduce exposure to pesticides. The literature review suggests a great need to increase awareness among people occupationally or environmentally exposed to pesticides about their potential negative influence on health of their children.","['Jurewicz, Joanna', 'Hanke, Wojciech']","['Jurewicz J', 'Hanke W']","['Department of Environmental Epdemiology, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland. joannaj@imp.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Risk Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology/etiology']",2007/01/27 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2478/v10001-006-0024-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2006;19(3):152-69. doi: 10.2478/v10001-006-0024-7.,,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed the demographic, treatment, toxicity, and outcome data of children with tAML and treatment related myelodysplastic syndrome (tMDS), treated at our institution between 1975 and 2005. We compared these parameters with matched controlled children with pAML. Finally we compared overall survival (OS) for tAML with all pAML children treated at the study era in our institution. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with tAML (n = 19) and tMDS (n = 2) were identified. Three years event-free survival (EFS) and OS were both 14 +/- 8%. Compared to pAML patients, tAML had a higher rate of adverse cytogenetics (P < 0.008) and inferior OS (P = 0.027) but no significant difference in treatment toxicity or death. All survivors were treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CONCLUSIONS: In this population based report of pediatric tAML, outcome was poor and was related to a higher probability of poor cytogenetic features rather than excessive toxicities or inability to deliver therapy. HSCT should be considered for patients with tAML.

PROCEDURE: Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and post-relapse outcome were evaluated for children with de novo AML on CCG 213 and the standard timing (ST) and intensive timing (IT) induction arms of CCG 2891 who were randomized to (intent-to-treat, ITT) or who received (as-treated, AT) only chemotherapy intensification. RESULTS: Outcomes at 8 years post-induction in ITT analysis of chemotherapy intensification were as follows: 31% DFS, 43% OS on CCG 213; 34% DFS, 51% OS on CCG 2891 ST; 48% DFS, 56% OS on CCG 2891 IT. All toxic deaths during and following Capizzi II chemotherapy intensification on both protocols were in patients >3 years of age (P </= 0.001). Black race was a significant poor prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.008, hazard ratio: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.15-2.61). Overall 48% of patients on both trials relapsed and 19.1% of patients who relapsed on these trials survived. CR1 >12 months portends a much better OS for patients who relapse. Post-relapse treatment included BMT in 47% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: OS on CCG 2891 was superior to CCG 213 but equivalent between ST and IT arms due to better salvage rates post-relapse in ST patients. Overall survival for childhood AML in the absence of BMT in CR1 is influenced by duration of CR1 and by race.","['Castellino, Sharon M', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Buxton, Allen', 'Gold, Stuart', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Woods, William G']","['Castellino SM', 'Alonzo TA', 'Buxton A', 'Gold S', 'Lange BJ', 'Woods WG']","['ETSU Quillen College of Medicine, Johnson City, Tennessee, USA. scastell@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2007/01/26 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21123 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jan;50(1):9-16. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21123.,"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Kushner et al.: J Clin Oncol 12:2607-2613,1994; Cheung et al.: Med Pediatr Oncol 36: 227-230, 2001; Kushner et al.: J Clin Oncol 22:4888-4892, 2004] using their N6 and subsequently N7 protocols. This N7 induction was adopted by UKCCSG for new patients in 1999. METHODS: Forty-seven children with metastatic neuroblastoma were recruited between 1999 and 2002. They received the N7 intensive chemotherapy protocol, after full staging including evaluation by I123mIBG imaging where possible. RESULTS: Thirty patients with positive mIBG scans were evaluable for response, and complete resolution of metastatic disease was obtained in 16 (53.3%). Fourteen patients without positive mIBG scans were evaluated for response according to bone marrow and bone scan data and 11 (78.6%) cleared metastatic disease. The toxicity of this induction therapy was similar to that seen in previous UK protocols, although 14 patients had Brock grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity. Thirty-three patients proceeded to high-dose therapy with no unanticipated toxicities. For the whole group of 44 evaluable patients, the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 38.3 and 46.7%, respectively.

By means of genome-wide expression profiling we have been able to identify genes exclusively deregulated in BL and PC from WM, but with a similar expression pattern in their corresponding cell counterparts from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM), as well as normal individuals. The differentially expressed genes have important functions in B-cell differentiation and oncogenesis. Thus, two of the genes downregulated in WM-BL were IL4R, which plays a relevant role in CLL B-cell survival, and BACH2, which participates in the development of class-switched PC. Interestingly, one of the upregulated genes in WM-BL was IL6. A set of four genes was able to discriminate clonal BL from WM and CLL: LEF1 (WNT/beta-catenin pathway), MARCKS, ATXN1 and FMOD. We also found deregulation of genes involved in plasma cell differentiation such as PAX5, which was overexpressed in WM-PC, and IRF4 and BLIMP1, which were underexpressed. In addition, three of the target genes activated by PAX5 - CD79, BLNK and SYK - were upregulated in WM-PC. In summary, these results indicate that both PC and BL from WM are genetically different from the MM and CLL cell counterpart.","['Gutierrez, N C', 'Ocio, E M', 'de Las Rivas, J', 'Maiso, P', 'Delgado, M', 'Ferminan, E', 'Arcos, M J', 'Sanchez, M L', 'Hernandez, J M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Gutierrez NC', 'Ocio EM', 'de Las Rivas J', 'Maiso P', 'Delgado M', 'Ferminan E', 'Arcos MJ', 'Sanchez ML', 'Hernandez JM', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca and Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Blood Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*pathology']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404520 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404520 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):541-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404520.

Patients reaching complete remission (CR) were then randomized to compare a timed-sequential consolidation to a postremission chemotherapy including four cycles of high-dose cytarabine followed by maintenance courses. In the appropriate arm, GM-CSF was given concurrently with chemotherapy during all cycles of consolidation. CR rates were significantly better in the GM-CSF arm (88 vs 78%, P<0.04), but did not differ after salvage. Patients receiving GM-CSF had a higher 3-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate (42 vs 34%), but GM-CSF did not impact on overall survival. Patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics benefited more from GM-CSF therapy (P=0.05) in terms of EFS than patients with other cytogenetics. This was also confirmed when considering only patients following the second randomization, or subgroups defined by a prognostic index based on cytogenetics and the number of courses required for achieving CR.

Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic as well as genetic processes maintain stem cells in a pluripotent state as well as dictate their transition to more restricted stages of development. In this review, we discuss two emerging themes in stem cell biology, epigenetic control of gene expression and post-transcriptional regulation via microRNAs. We summarize how these regulatory mechanisms facilitate various aspects of normal stem cell biology and extend the discussion to their involvement in aging and tumorigeneisis, two biological phenomena intimately tied to stem cells. We speculate that aberrant epigenetic events and altered miRNA expression profiles in aged stem cell populations play important roles in carcinogenesis.","['Oakley, E J', 'Van Zant, G']","['Oakley EJ', 'Van Zant G']","['Department of Physiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404530 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404530 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):612-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404530.

Prolonged monotherapy is frequently associated with patients becoming refractory to imatinib. Therefore, there is considerable interest in small molecule inhibitors which may be used either as replacements or as adjuncts to existing imatinib therapy. For this purpose, it is most likely that drugs which do not share imatinib's mechanism of action will be most valuable. We compared two such compounds with different modes of action, adaphostin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), for their cytotoxic effect and ability to induce the downregulation of cellular proteins in a murine haemopoietic cell line transformed with human p210(Bcr-Abl), and two subclones resistant to imatinib owing to an Abl-kinase domain mutation (E255K) or amplification of the BCR-ABL gene, respectively. We found that, whereas 17-AAG selectively killed Bcr-Abl-positive cells and inhibited proteins dependent on heat-shock protein 90 for their stability (p210(Bcr-Abl) and Akt), adaphostin induced the downregulation of multiple cell-signalling proteins (p210(Bcr-Abl), Akt, Bcr, Abl and STAT5a) and was cytotoxic to both Bcr-Abl-positive and -negative cells.

In order to study the molecular mechanisms by which altered Notch signaling induces leukemia, a zebrafish model of human NOTCH1-induced T-cell leukemia was generated. Seven of sixteen mosaic fish developed a T-cell lymphoproliferative disease at about 5 months. These neoplastic cells extensively invaded tissues throughout the fish and caused an aggressive and lethal leukemia when transplanted into irradiated recipient fish. However, stable transgenic fish exhibited a longer latency for leukemia onset. When the stable transgenic line was crossed with another line overexpressing the zebrafish bcl2 gene, the leukemia onset was dramatically accelerated, indicating synergy between the Notch pathway and the bcl2-mediated antiapoptotic pathway. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that Notch target genes such as her6 and her9 were highly expressed in NOTCH1-induced leukemias. The ability of this model to detect a strong interaction between NOTCH1 and bcl2 suggests that genetic modifier screens have a high likelihood of revealing other genes that can cooperate with NOTCH1 to induce T-ALL.","['Chen, J', 'Jette, C', 'Kanki, J P', 'Aster, J C', 'Look, A T', 'Griffin, J D']","['Chen J', 'Jette C', 'Kanki JP', 'Aster JC', 'Look AT', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Her6 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (her9 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/physiology']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404546 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404546 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):462-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404546.

Little is known about receptors specifically expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells or ligands thereof. We selected random phage display peptide libraries on Kasumi-1 AML cells. A peptide with the sequence CPLDIDFYC was enriched. Phage displaying this peptide strongly bound to Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells and binding could be inhibited by the cognate peptide. Both, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells carry the chromosomal translocation t(8;21), leading to aberrant expression of the fusion protein AML1/ETO. CPLDIDFYC also strongly and specifically bound primary AML1/ETO-positive AML blasts as well as U-937 cells with forced AML1/ETO expression, suggesting that the CPLDIDFYC receptor may be upregulated upon AML1/ETO expression. Gene expression profiling comparing a panel of CPLDIDFYC-binding and CPLDIDFYC-nonbinding cell lines identified a set of potential receptors for the CPLDIDFYC peptide. Further analysis suggested that alpha4beta1 integrin (VLA-4) is the CPLDIDFYC receptor. Finally, we showed that the CPLDIDFYC-phage is internalized upon receptor binding, suggesting that the CPLDIDFYC-receptor-ligand interaction may be exploitable for targeting drugs or gene therapy vectors to leukemia cells carrying the suitable receptor.","['Jager, S', 'Jahnke, A', 'Wilmes, T', 'Adebahr, S', 'Vogtle, F-N', 'Delima-Hahn, E', 'Pfeifer, D', 'Berg, T', 'Lubbert, M', 'Trepel, M']","['Jager S', 'Jahnke A', 'Wilmes T', 'Adebahr S', 'Vogtle FN', 'Delima-Hahn E', 'Pfeifer D', 'Berg T', 'Lubbert M', 'Trepel M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/physiology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', '*Peptide Library', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Drug/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404548 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404548 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):411-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404548.

Expression data reflected several BCR-ABL-induced effects in primary CML progenitors, such as transcriptional activation of the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT pathway as well as downregulation of the proapoptotic gene IRF8. Moreover, novel transcriptional changes in comparison with normal CD34+ cells were identified. These include upregulation of genes involved in the transforming growth factorbeta pathway, fetal hemoglobin genes, leptin receptor, sorcin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, the neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 and downregulation of selenoprotein P. Additionally, genes associated with early hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and leukemogenesis such as HoxA9 and MEIS1 were transcriptionally activated. Differential expression of differentiation-associated genes suggested an altered composition of the CD34+ cell population in CML. This was confirmed by subset analyses of chronic phase CML CD34+ cells showing an increase of the proportion of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, whereas the proportion of HSC and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors was decreased in CML.

In patients who relapse during imatinib therapy, a high rate of mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL have been identified, but the mechanisms underlying disease persistence in patients with a CCR are poorly characterized. To test whether kinase domain mutations are a common mechanism of disease persistence, we studied patients in stable CCR. Mutations were demonstrated in eight of 42 (19%) patients with successful amplification and sequencing of BCR-ABL. Mutation types were those commonly associated with acquired drug resistance. Four patients with mutations had a concomitant rise of BCR-ABL transcript levels, two of whom subsequently relapsed; the remaining four did not have an increase in transcript levels and follow-up samples, when amplifiable, were wild type. BCR-ABL-kinase domain mutations in patients with a stable CCR are infrequent, and their detection does not consistently predict relapse. Alternative mechanisms must be responsible for disease persistence in the majority of patients.","['Sherbenou, D W', 'Wong, M J', 'Humayun, A', 'McGreevey, L S', 'Harrell, P', 'Yang, R', 'Mauro, M', 'Heinrich, M C', 'Press, R D', 'Druker, B J', 'Deininger, M W']","['Sherbenou DW', 'Wong MJ', 'Humayun A', 'McGreevey LS', 'Harrell P', 'Yang R', 'Mauro M', 'Heinrich MC', 'Press RD', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Refusal']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404554 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404554 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):489-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404554.

Patients (n=67) were randomized to subcutaneous epoetin beta 30 000 IU once weekly for 16 weeks with or without concomitant intravenous iron supplementation. There was a significantly (P<0.05) greater increase in mean Hb from week 8 onwards in the iron group and the percentage of patients with Hb increase >or=2 g/dl was significantly higher in the iron group (93%) than in the no-iron group (53%) (per-protocol population; P=0.001). Higher serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in the iron group indicated that iron availability accounted for the Hb response difference. The mean weekly patient epoetin dose was significantly lower after 13 weeks of therapy (P=0.029) and after 15 weeks approximately 10 000 IU (>25%) lower in the iron group, as was the total epoetin dose (P=0.051).

The steps consisted of selecting the candidate criteria for defining resistance/intolerance; identifying the motivations that could influence the preference of the WG for any individual criterion; comparing the candidate criteria in a pair-wise manner; and grading them according their ability to fulfill the motivations. Every step in the model was derived by questionnaires or group discussion. The WG proposed that the definition of resistance/intolerance should require the fulfillment of at least one of the following criteria: platelet count greater than 600,000/micro l after 3 months of at least 2 g/day of HU (2.5 g/day in patients with a body weight over 80 kg); platelet count greater than 400,000/micro l and WBC less than 2500/micro l or Hb less than 10 g/dl at any dose of HU; presence of leg ulcers or other unacceptable muco-cutaneous manifestations at any dose of HU; HU-related fever.","['Barosi, G', 'Besses, C', 'Birgegard, G', 'Briere, J', 'Cervantes, F', 'Finazzi, G', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Griesshammer, M', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Harrison, C', 'Hasselbalch, H', 'Lengfelder, E', 'Reilly, J T', 'Michiels, J J', 'Barbui, T']","['Barosi G', 'Besses C', 'Birgegard G', 'Briere J', 'Cervantes F', 'Finazzi G', 'Gisslinger H', 'Griesshammer M', 'Gugliotta L', 'Harrison C', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Lengfelder E', 'Reilly JT', 'Michiels JJ', 'Barbui T']","['Unit of Clinical Epidemiology and Center for the Study of Myelofibrosis, IRCCS Policlinico S Matteo, Pavia, Italy. barosig@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Consensus Development Conferences as Topic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Patient Selection', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404473 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404473 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):277-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404473.

During fusion, the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) is thought to undergo a transition from a rod-like pre-hairpin conformation that is stabilized by a trimeric coiled coil to a more compact six-helix-bundle or trimer-of-hairpins structure. Importantly, synthetic peptides that interfere with the conformational changes of TM are potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and HTLV-1 entry, suggesting that the pre-hairpin motif is a valid target for antiviral therapy. Here, a stable, trimeric TM derivative that mimics the coiled-coil structure of fusion-active TM has been used to develop a plate-based assay to identify reagents that interfere with the formation of the six-helix bundle. The assay discriminates effectively between strong, weak and inactive peptide inhibitors of membrane fusion and has been used to identify a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that disrupts six-helix-bundle formation efficiently in vitro. The mAb is reactive with the C-helical region of TM, indicating that this region of TM is immunogenic. However, the mAb failed to neutralize HTLV-1 envelope-mediated membrane fusion, suggesting that, on native viral envelope, the epitope recognized by the mAb is obscured during fusion. This novel mAb will be of value in the immunological characterization of fusion-active structures of HTLV-1 TM. Moreover, the assay developed here will aid the search for therapeutic antibodies, peptides and small-molecule inhibitors targeting envelope and the HTLV-1 entry process.","['Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Nurkiyanova, Kulpash', 'Lamb, Daniel', 'Kuo, Chien-Wen S', 'Brighty, David W']","['Mirsaliotis A', 'Nurkiyanova K', 'Lamb D', 'Kuo CS', 'Brighty DW']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion/*drug effects', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.82390-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2007 Feb;88(Pt 2):660-669. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.82390-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.82390-0 [doi],,,,,,

METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter study involving evaluators who were unaware of treatment assignments, we compared the efficacy and safety of posaconazole with those of fluconazole or itraconazole as prophylaxis for patients with prolonged neutropenia. Patients received prophylaxis with each cycle of chemotherapy until recovery from neutropenia and complete remission, until occurrence of an invasive fungal infection, or for up to 12 weeks, whichever came first. We compared the incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal infections during treatment (the primary end point) between the posaconazole and fluconazole or itraconazole groups; death from any cause and time to death were secondary end points. RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were randomly assigned to receive posaconazole, and 298 patients were randomly assigned to receive fluconazole (240) or itraconazole (58). Proven or probable invasive fungal infections were reported in 7 patients (2%) in the posaconazole group and 25 patients (8%) in the fluconazole or itraconazole group (absolute reduction in the posaconazole group, -6%; 95% confidence interval, -9.7 to -2.5%; P<0.001), fulfilling statistical criteria for superiority. Significantly fewer patients in the posaconazole group had invasive aspergillosis (2 [1%] vs. 20 [7%], P<0.001). Survival was significantly longer among recipients of posaconazole than among recipients of fluconazole or itraconazole (P=0.04). Serious adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment were reported by 19 patients (6%) in the posaconazole group and 6 patients (2%) in the fluconazole or itraconazole group (P=0.01). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal tract disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or the myelodysplastic syndrome, posaconazole prevented invasive fungal infections more effectively than did either fluconazole or itraconazole and improved overall survival. There were more serious adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment in the posaconazole group.

AID is a potent mutator because it is involved in DNA breakage not only of Ig but also of other genes, including proto-oncogenes. Recent studies suggest that AID is required for chromosomal translocation involving cmyc and Ig loci. However, it is unclear whether AID plays other roles in tumorigenesis. We examined the effect of AID deficiency on the generation of surface Ig-positive B cell lymphomas in Emu-cmyc transgenic mice. Almost all lymphomas that developed in AID-deficient transgenic mice were pre-B cell lymphomas, whereas control transgenic mice had predominantly B cell lymphomas, indicating that AID is required for development of B but not pre-B cell lymphomas from cmyc overexpressing tumor progenitors. Thus, AID may play multiple roles in B cell lymphomagenesis.","['Kotani, Ai', 'Kakazu, Naoki', 'Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki', 'Okazaki, Il-mi', 'Muramatsu, Masamichi', 'Kinoshita, Kazuo', 'Nagaoka, Hitoshi', 'Yabe, Daisuke', 'Honjo, Tasuku']","['Kotani A', 'Kakazu N', 'Tsuruyama T', 'Okazaki IM', 'Muramatsu M', 'Kinoshita K', 'Nagaoka H', 'Yabe D', 'Honjo T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/03/10 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['0610732104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0610732104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jan 30;104(5):1616-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0610732104.

FISH identified cryptic losses of various portions of the IGHV region in all 14 cases. Fine mapping of these V(H) deletions revealed a strict correlation between their distal border and localization of the used VH gene, suggesting that they are not oncogenic but reflect physiological events accompanying somatic V-D-J assembly. This hypothesis was further supported by FISH analysis of 20 CLL and hairy cell leukemia cases with the known V(H) usage showing a constant loss of sequences proximal to the used gene, identification of V(H) deletions in normal B cells, and their exclusive demonstration in B cell malignancies, but not of T cell and myeloid linage.

However, only a few of them have followed the patients all the way through a disease as is done in this study. Many studies have been written about patients' coping strategies. In this study we will keep within the bounds of coping through information only. The aim of the study is to investigate patients' views of information during the trajectory of their disease, whether their reactions differ from each other and whether they differ in different phases of the disease. METHODS: Twelve patients with malignant haematological diseases or lung cancer were followed with interviews from diagnosis to recovery or into the terminal phase or at most for two years. The method is qualitative, using semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Orebro University Hospital or the patient's home. RESULTS: All patients described themselves as well informed from the start but in later phases of their disease some of them came to express a great uncertainty about the progressing disease and about the approaching death. Most of them, regardless of whether they had a haematological malignancy or lung cancer, expressed a wish to be well informed all through the disease and even when the messages were bad. Different strategies for coping with information, however, affected how they then dealt with the information received. Four such coping strategies were found: 1) Information-dependent and accepting; 2) Information-dependent but denying; 3) Medically informed and accepting; 4) Medically informed but denying. CONCLUSION: To several patients there was an unmet need for information about the progressing disease and the approaching death. To optimize the care of these patients it seems important that the physician is aware of patients' need for information even when the news is bad. Knowing the patient's information strategy could probably function as a key for the physician to communicate with patients on these matters.","['Hoff, Lena', 'Tidefelt, Ulf', 'Thaning, Lars', 'Hermeren, Goran']","['Hoff L', 'Tidefelt U', 'Thaning L', 'Hermeren G']","['Department of Medical Ethics, Lund University, Sweden. lenahoff@telia.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Palliat Care,BMC palliative care,101088685,,,,2007/01/26 09:00,2007/01/26 09:01,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:01 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1472-684X-6-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-684X-6-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Palliat Care. 2007 Jan 24;6:1. doi: 10.1186/1472-684X-6-1.,,PMC1794231,,,,20070124,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro and in vivo the immunogenic properties of three engineered derivatives of Ole e 1. METHODS: One point (Y141A) and two deletion (135Delta10 and 140Delta5) mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of Ole e 1-specific cDNA and produced in Pichia pastoris. Ole e 1 mutants were analysed for IgE reactivity by ELISA using sera from olive pollen-allergic patients. Their allergenicity was also investigated in both a mouse model of allergic sensitization and in basophil activation assays. IgG1 response was assayed by immunoblotting and competitive ELISA. T cell reactivity was evaluated by proliferation assays and cytokine production in splenocyte cultures. RESULTS: The 135Delta10 mutant showed the strongest reduction in the IgE-binding capability of sera from olive pollen-allergic patients. Rat basophil leukaemia assays identified the deletion mutant 135Delta10 as the variant with the lowest beta-hexosaminidase-releasing capacity. Furthermore, the same 135Delta10 mutant induced the lowest IgE levels in a BALB/c mouse model of sensitization. All Ole e 1 mutants retained their allergen-specific T cell reactivity. Immunization of mice with the mutants induced IgG1 antibodies, which cross-reacted with Ole e 1 and Ole e 1-like allergens from ash, lilac and privet pollens. The ability of the human IgE to block the binding of anti-Ole e 1 mutant-specific mouse IgG1 antibodies to natural Ole e 1 demonstrated that Ole e 1 mutants are able to induce in vivo antibodies reactive to the natural allergen. CONCLUSION: The 135Delta10 mutant with reduced allergenicity, intact T cell reactivity and capacity to induce blocking antibodies could provide a suitable candidate vaccine for efficient and safer therapy of olive pollen allergy.","['Marazuela, E G', 'Rodriguez, R', 'Barber, D', 'Villalba, M', 'Batanero, E']","['Marazuela EG', 'Rodriguez R', 'Barber D', 'Villalba M', 'Batanero E']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ole e I protein, Olea europaea)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions/*immunology', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Oleaceae/*immunology', 'Plant Proteins/*immunology', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/biosynthesis/*immunology']",2007/01/26 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEA2632 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02632.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2007 Feb;37(2):251-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02632.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The remaining 164 cases were positive for malignancy, out of which 38 cases revealed malignancies other than adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: The 38 unusual malignancies metastasizing to the pleural cavity included 29 haematological malignancies (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoid leukaemia, multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid leukaemia) and nine non-haematological malignancies (Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma).

It is characterized by an abnormal release of the expanded, malignant stem cell clone from the bone marrow into the circulation. The stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) gene contains a common polymorphism, termed SDF1-3'A, in an evolutionarily conserved segment of the 3' untranslated region (UTR). In this work the SDF-1 genotypes of 25 patients (9-82 years old) who had been clinically and hematologically diagnosed with CML were compared with those of 60 healthy donors. In addition, the nature of bcr-abl hybrid mRNA and the association between demographic and hematological parameters were analyzed in cells from 12 CML patients (five women and seven men). All patients underwent blood collection during the chronic phase of disease after they received chemotherapy. b3a2 mRNA was detected in samples from eight of the CML patients and b2a2 mRNA was observed in four cases. An association between basophils and hemoglobin parameters was observed in that hemoglobin levels were higher in b2a2-expressing patients, and mean basophil levels were higher in patients expressing b3a2. Four of the CML patients (16%) were homozygous for 3'A allele. Of the patients who showed the presence of bcr-abl transcripts (N = 12), three presented the wt/wt genotype and nine were SDF1-3'A carriers. Three of the latter were homozygous for this mutation.

In this study, redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) is shown to induce mitochondria-mediated necrotic cell death in GL-av cells (fish cells) via cytochrome c release, and anti-apoptotic proteins are shown to protect these cells from death. Western blots revealed that cytochrome c release coincided with disruption of mitochondrial ultrastructure and preceded necrosis, but did not correlate with caspases activation. To identify the mediator(s) of this necrotic process, a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; CHX; 0.33 microg/ml) was used to block cytochrome c release as well as PS exposure and mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (MMP) loss. CHX (0.33 microg/ml) completely blocked viral protein B2 expression, and partly blocked protein A, protein alpha, and a pro-apoptotic death protein (Bad) expression. Overexpression of B2 gene increased necrotic-like cell death up to 30% at 48 h post-transfection, suggesting that newly synthesized protein (B2) may be involved in this necrotic process. Finally, necrotic death was prevented by overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins, zfBcl-x(L) and xfMcl-1a. Thus, new protein synthesis and release of cytochrome c are required for RGNNV-induced necrotic cell death, which can be blocked by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members.","['Chen, Shi-Ping', 'Wu, Jen-Leih', 'Su, Yu-Chin', 'Hong, Jiann-Ruey']","['Chen SP', 'Wu JL', 'Su YC', 'Hong JR']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fishes/virology', 'Liver/cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Necrosis/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nodaviridae/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Diseases', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0032-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Jun;12(6):1043-60. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0032-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the result of an extensive search for molecules to block the aberrant activity of Abl kinase in the fusion protein Bcr-Abl. In addition, it can specifically inhibit the activity of c-Kit and PDGF receptors. This orally bioavailable drug has a low toxicity profile. It is approved to treat the patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). It produces hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular remission with significant efficacy, particularly in patients with chronic-phase CML. However, there is well-documented proof of primary and secondary resistance to STI571 with progression of leukemia. More evidence indicates that this single drug may not be sufficient to completely eradicate BCR-ABL-positive stem cells. A variety of strategies has already been developed to improve the effectiveness of CML treatment, including targeting the expression or stability of the Bcr-Abl kinase itself, targeting signaling pathways activated by this kinase, as well as designing novel Abl inhibitors. In this review the molecular mechanisms of STI571 action, its effectivenes against CML, GIST, and melanoma, as well as new approaches to improve its efficacy, mainly by overcoming STI571 resistance, are discussed.","['Czyz, Malgorzata', 'Jakubowska, Justyna']","['Czyz M', 'Jakubowska J']",['Zaklad Biologii Molekularnej Nowotworow Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Lodzi. mczyz@csk.umed.lodz.pl'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/03/08 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['9984 [pii]'],ppublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2006;60:677-96.,,,,,,,151,,,,STI571--terapia celowana.,,,,,,,

In fact, its overexpression in human cancer often correlates with poor prognosis. Traditionally, eIF4E plays a role in translation initiation where it binds the 5' m7G cap found on mRNAs. More recent studies indicate that a significant fraction of eIF4E (up to 68%) resides in the nucleus where it regulates the nuclear export of specific mRNAs. Additionally, eIF4E may play a role in mRNA sequestration and stability in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies). Our recent studies suggest that eIF4E governs cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation by coordinately orchestrating the expression of several genes at the post-transcriptional level. Hence, eIF4E functions as a central node of an RNA regulon (described below), which plays an essential role in normal differentiation and development and is frequently dysregulated in cancer. Several cellular factors, such as the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML, modulate the function of this regulon by altering the activity of eIF4E. Here, the physiological implications of these observations are described and the clinical implications of directly targeting eIF4E, and the related regulon, are discussed.","['Culjkovic, Biljana', 'Topisirovic, Ivan', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Culjkovic B', 'Topisirovic I', 'Borden KL']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*physiology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms', 'RNA/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Regulon/*physiology']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['3688 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.1.3688 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Jan 1;6(1):65-9. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.1.3688.

Here, we show that AML1/ETO, the most common translocation fusion product in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), counteracts the activity of retinoic acid (RA), a transcriptional regulator of myelopoiesis. AML1/ETO participates in a protein complex with the RA receptor alpha (RARalpha) at RA regulatory regions on RARbeta2, which is a key RA target gene mediating RA activity/resistance in cells. At these sites, AML1/ETO recruits histone deacetylase, DNA methyltransferase, and DNA-methyl-CpG binding activities that promote a repressed chromatin conformation. The link among AML1/ETO, heterochromatic RARbeta2 repression, RA resistance, and myeloid differentiation block is indicated by the ability of either siRNA-AML1/ETO or the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine to revert these epigenetic alterations and to restore RA differentiation response in AML1/ETO blasts. Finally, RARbeta2 is commonly silenced by hypermethylation in primary AML blasts but not in normal hematopoietic precursors, thus suggesting a role for the epigenetic repression of the RA signaling pathway in myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Fazi, Francesco', 'Zardo, Giuseppe', 'Gelmetti, Vania', 'Travaglini, Lorena', 'Ciolfi, Alberto', 'Di Croce, Luciano', 'Rosa, Alessandro', 'Bozzoni, Irene', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Nervi, Clara']","['Fazi F', 'Zardo G', 'Gelmetti V', 'Travaglini L', 'Ciolfi A', 'Di Croce L', 'Rosa A', 'Bozzoni I', 'Grignani F', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Pelicci PG', 'Nervi C']","['San Raffaele Bio-medical Park Foundation, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Heterochromatin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Retinoid X Receptors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41569-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-045781 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4432-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-045781.

However, embryonic lethality in its absence has prevented an assessment of its role in B-cell development. Here, using Rag1-deficient blastocyst complementation assays, we demonstrate that Pbx1 null embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to generate common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) resulting in a complete lack of B and NK cells, and a partial impairment of T-cell development in chimeric mice. A critical role for Pbx1 was confirmed by rescue of B-cell development from CLPs following restoration of its expression in Pbx1-deficient ES cells. In adoptive transfer experiments, B-cell development from Pbx1-deficient fetal liver cells was also severely compromised, but not erased, since transient B lymphopoiesis was detected in Rag-deficient recipients. Conditional inactivation of Pbx1 in pro-B (CD19(+)) cells and thereafter revealed that Pbx1 is not necessary for B-cell development to proceed from the pro-B-cell stage. Thus, Pbx1 critically functions at a stage between hematopoietic stem cell development and B-cell commitment and, therefore, is one of the earliest-acting transcription factors that regulate de novo B-lineage lymphopoiesis.","['Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Tung, James W', 'Karsunky, Holger', 'Zeng, Hong', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Herzenberg, Leonore A', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Sanyal M', 'Tung JW', 'Karsunky H', 'Zeng H', 'Selleri L', 'Weissman IL', 'Herzenberg LA', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Blastocyst/immunology', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41539-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-10-054213 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4191-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-054213.

AIM: To identify any long-term adverse health outcomes from occupational exposures in this industry. METHODS: The mortality (1951-2003) and cancer morbidity (1971-2003) experienced by cohorts of 28,555 oil refinery workers and 16,477 petroleum distribution workers has been investigated. Study subjects were all those males first employed in the period 1946-74 at one of eight UK oil refineries or 476 UK petroleum distribution centres; all subjects had a minimum of 12 months employment with some employment after 1 January 1951. Observed numbers of cause-specific deaths and site-specific cancer registrations were compared with expectations based on national mortality and cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were significantly <100 for all causes both in oil refinery workers (Obs 11,156, SMR 89) and in petroleum distribution workers (Obs 7320, SMR 96). Significantly elevated SMRs were shown in oil refinery workers for cancer of the pleura (mesothelioma) (Obs 64, SMR 261) and melanoma (Obs 48, SMR 168). Significantly elevated SMRs were not found in petroleum distribution workers for any site of cancer. Significantly elevated standardized registration ratios (SRRs) were only shown in oil refinery workers and for cancer of the pleura (mesothelioma) (Obs 115, SMR 274), melanoma (Obs 85, SMR 129) and other skin cancer (Obs 983, SRR 117).

These concepts were first definitively demonstrated in human acute myelogenous leukemia, in which regeneration of a diversely heterogeneous human leukemia cell population in a xenograft mouse model occurred only after injection of a rare relatively homogeneous population of leukemic cells that expressed hematopoietic stem cell markers. Recently, through advances in understanding of normal neural stem cell biology, the use of techniques for cell purification by flow cytometry, and the development of cell functional assays in vivo, the time was made ripe for several groups to characterize brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). The BTSC resides in the cell fraction expressing the neural precursor cell surface marker CD133.","['Singh, Sheila', 'Dirks, Peter B']","['Singh S', 'Dirks PB']","['The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Suite 1503, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Neurosurg Clin N Am,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,9008004,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/physiopathology', 'Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology']",2007/01/25 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2007/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1042-3680(06)00130-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nec.2006.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,"Neurosurg Clin N Am. 2007 Jan;18(1):31-8, viii. doi: 10.1016/j.nec.2006.10.014.",,,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,

Using PCR analysis, the same immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement was found in lymphocytes in all samples (peripheral blood, bone marrow and skin lesion). The patient received four courses of oral fludarabine. Simultaneously with the normalization of the peripheral blood lymphocytosis, the patient became free of the cutaneous infiltration of CLL after four courses of oral fludarabine. Skin lesions had not recurred by the 12-month follow-up examination. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B-CLL leukaemia cutis treated with oral fludarabine.

OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern and onset of nail changes in cancer children receiving various chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 30 paediatric patients (aged 1-17, mean 8.3 years), including 11 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, five with acute myeloid leukaemia, and others. RESULTS: Nail changes developed in 10 children during chemotherapy, five of whom had Muehrcke's lines, three Beau's lines, one Mees' lines and another had trachyonychia. There appeared to be no correlation between the pattern of nail alteration and the underlying cancer types or stages, or the regimens of chemotherapy.

Thus, FISH with probes directed to the RUNX1 gene remains the most reliable detection method. Metaphase FISH, supported by G- and multiple color chromosomal banding (mBAND) revealed the patient specific morphology and genetic profile of the dup(21q) chromosomes, as well as the complexity of the intrachromosomal changes giving rise to them.

Genetic events occurring during malignant transformation in FA and the biology of FA-associated AML are poorly understood, but are often preceded by the development of chromosomal aberrations involving 3q26-29 in bone marrow of FA patients. We report here the molecular cytogenetic characterization of FA-derived AML cell lines SB1685CB and SB1690CB by conventional and array comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and SKY. We identified gains of a 3.7 MB chromosomal region on 3q26.2-26.31, which preceded transformation to overt leukemia. This region harbors the oncogenic transcription factor EVI1. A third FA-derived cell line, FA-AML1, carried a translocation with ectopic localization of 3q26 including EVI1. Rearrangements of 3q, which are rare in childhood AML, commonly result in overexpression of EVI1, which determines specific gene expression patterns and confers poor prognosis. We detected overexpression of EVI1 in all three FA-derived AML. Our results suggest a link between the FA defect, chromosomal aberrations involving 3q and overexpression of EVI1. We hypothesize that constitutional or acquired FA defects might be a common factor for the development of 3q abnormalities in AML. In addition, cryptic imbalances as detected here might account for overexpression of EVI1 in AML without overt 3q26 rearrangements.","['Meyer, Stefan', 'Fergusson, William D', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Moreira-Leite, Flavia', 'Pepper, Stuart D', 'Miller, Crispin', 'Saunders, Emma K', 'White, Daniel J', 'Will, Andrew M', 'Eden, Tim', 'Ikeda, Hideyuki', 'Ullmann, Reinhard', 'Tuerkmen, Seval', 'Gerlach, Antje', 'Klopocki, Eva', 'Tonnies, Holger']","['Meyer S', 'Fergusson WD', 'Whetton AD', 'Moreira-Leite F', 'Pepper SD', 'Miller C', 'Saunders EK', 'White DJ', 'Will AM', 'Eden T', 'Ikeda H', 'Ullmann R', 'Tuerkmen S', 'Gerlach A', 'Klopocki E', 'Tonnies H']","['Academic Unit of Paediatric Oncology, Christie Hospital Trust, University of anchester, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'BRCA2 Protein/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/04/19 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20417 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Apr;46(4):359-72. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20417.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the occurrence of second tumors in irradiated and non-irradiated survivors. METHODS: Two hundred and ten survivors of ALL and T-NHL were treated between 1974 and 1997 by several protocols. Imaging (MRI, CT) was performed every 3-6 years in 76/88 irradiated and 74/122 non-irradiated patients for the last 20 years. RESULTS: From January 1998 through 2004, meningiomas were detected in 16 survivors (8 female, 8 male) at age 20-39 years (median 28.7); 15 were asymptomatic. Cranial imaging done 2-8 years previously in 11 revealed no abnormalities. Fifteen had been diagnosed with ALL or T-NHL 10-29 years earlier (median 21) and received cranial irradiation (24 Gy in 14) at age 2-14 years (median 7.6). Fifteen tumors arose in the convexity. Three patients had multiple lesions. Complete resection was performed in 12 patients, with one complication. One patient had a recurrence, and four with small tumors are under surveillance. Only one low-grade glioma and two basal-cell carcinomas were found. Only one of the 74 non-irradiated patients (median follow-up 14 years) developed meningioma. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of incidence of meningioma was 14.8+/-7.6 at 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL treated with cranial radiation require prolonged surveillance because of a high incidence of late meningiomas. Early detection, when the tumor is still small, facilitates resection and may reduce complications.","['Goshen, Yacov', 'Stark, Batia', 'Kornreich, Liora', 'Michowiz, Shalom', 'Feinmesser, Meora', 'Yaniv, Isaac']","['Goshen Y', 'Stark B', 'Kornreich L', 'Michowiz S', 'Feinmesser M', 'Yaniv I']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel. ygoshen@clalit.org.il""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Meningioma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21153 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Sep;49(3):294-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21153.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered p53 and p73 protein expression observed in leukemic cells of molluscs suggests that these transcription factors might be involved in invertebrate cancers as well. Here, we fully characterize the mRNA of four novel p53-like variants in the bivalve molluscs Mytilus trossulus (bay mussel) and Mytilus edulis (blue mussel). These species, widely used for environmental assessment, develop a hemic neoplasia (leukemia) that is frequently fatal. The correlation between expression of p53 and its close relative p73 and onset of molluscan leukemia was documented previously. We report the sequences of two distinct and novel p63/p73-like mRNAs, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from both species. One of the p63/p73-like isoforms contains a 360 nt truncation in the 5' coding region. Based on this truncation and concomitant lack of a transactivation (TA) domain, we designate this variant as a DeltaNp63/p73-like isoform: the first to be reported in an invertebrate species. In mammalian species, DeltaNp73 potently inhibits the tumor-suppressive function of p73 and p53, and its overexpression serves as a robust marker for mammalian cancer. In addition, we report on the occurrence of alternate polyadenylation sites in the molluscan p63/p73: one proximal and one distal site, which differ by 1260 nt. We hypothesize that differential expression of various molluscan p63/p73-like isoforms, controlled in part by polyadenylation site choice variation, may help to interpret the apparently opposing roles of this gene in the development of cancer. Overall, this research further illustrates the utility of the molluscan model for studies involving the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis in naturally occurring populations. The data presented here require a revisiting of hypotheses regarding evolution of the p53 gene family. Current hypotheses indicate that (1) the protostome gene family does not contain an intronic promoter for DeltaN expression and (2) p53 gene duplication did not occur in protostomes. Our characterization of DeltaN p63/73 in mussel suggests that molluscan p53 gene family members have acquired an intronic promoter or splicing mechanism, either by invention that predates the evolutionary split of deuterostomes from protostomes, or by parallel evolution. Our data also show that Mytilus p53, p63/p73, and DeltaNp63/p73 are identical in their core regions with variation limited to their C- and N-terminals, supporting the notion that alternative splicing, intronic promoter usage, and polyadenylation site choice may lead to expression of distinct isoforms originating from one common gene.","['Muttray, Annette F', 'Cox, Rachel L', 'Reinisch, Carol L', 'Baldwin, Susan A']","['Muttray AF', 'Cox RL', 'Reinisch CL', 'Baldwin SA']","['Laboratory of Aquatic Biomedicine, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts 02543, USA. amuttray@chml.ubc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mar Biotechnol (NY),"Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)",100892712,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal Spacer)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mytilus/*physiology', 'Mytilus edulis/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Polyadenylation/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein/veterinary', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10126-006-6045-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mar Biotechnol (NY). 2007 Mar-Apr;9(2):217-30. doi: 10.1007/s10126-006-6045-1.

One of the earliest steps in the senescence program is translocation of a histone chaperone, HIRA, into promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. This relocalization precedes other markers of senescence, including the appearance of specialized domains of facultative heterochromatin called senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and cell cycle exit. SAHF represses expression of proliferation-promoting genes, thereby driving exit from the cell cycle. HIRA bound to another histone chaperone, ASF1a, drives formation of SAHF. Here, we show that HIRA's translocation to PML bodies occurs in response to all senescence triggers tested. Dominant negative HIRA mutants that block HIRA's localization to PML bodies prevent formation of SAHF, as does a PML-RARalpha fusion protein which disrupts PML bodies, directly supporting the idea that localization of HIRA to PML bodies is required for formation of SAHF. Significantly, translocation of HIRA to PML bodies occurs in the absence of functional pRB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways. However, our evidence indicates that downstream of HIRA's localization to PML bodies, the HIRA/ASF1a pathway cooperates with pRB and p53 to make SAHF, with the HIRA/ASF1a and pRB pathways acting in parallel. We present evidence that convergence of the HIRA/ASF1a and pRB pathways occurs through a DNAJ-domain protein, DNAJA2.","['Ye, Xiaofen', 'Zerlanko, Brad', 'Zhang, Rugang', 'Somaiah, Neeta', 'Lipinski, Marc', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Adams, Peter D']","['Ye X', 'Zerlanko B', 'Zhang R', 'Somaiah N', 'Lipinski M', 'Salomoni P', 'Adams PD']","['Department of Basic Science, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 333 Cottman Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (ASF1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNAJA2 protein, human)', '0 (HIRA protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heterochromatin/*physiology', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01592-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01592-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Apr;27(7):2452-65. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01592-06.

We reported that TAL-1 acts positively on postnatal angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial morphogenesis. Here, we investigated the functional consequences of TAL-1 silencing in human primary endothelial cells. We found that TAL-1 knockdown caused the inhibition of in vitro tubulomorphogenesis, which was associated with a dramatic reduction in vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) at intercellular junctions. Consistently, silencing of TAL-1 as well as of its cofactors E47 and LMO2 down-regulated VE-cadherin at both the mRNA and the protein level. Endogenous VE-cadherin transcription could be activated in nonendothelial HEK-293 cells by the sole concomitant ectopic expression of TAL-1, E47, and LMO2. Transient transfections in human primary endothelial cells derived from umbilical vein (HUVECs) demonstrated that VE-cadherin promoter activity was dependent on the integrity of a specialized E-box associated with a GATA motif and was maximal with the coexpression of the different components of the TAL-1 complex. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TAL-1 and its cofactors occupied the VE-cadherin promoter in HUVECs. Together, these data identify VE-cadherin as a bona fide target gene of the TAL-1 complex in the endothelial lineage, providing a first clue to TAL-1 function in angiogenesis.","['Deleuze, Virginie', 'Chalhoub, Elias', 'El-Hajj, Rawan', 'Dohet, Christiane', 'Le Clech, Mikael', 'Couraud, Pierre-Olivier', 'Huber, Philippe', 'Mathieu, Daniele']","['Deleuze V', 'Chalhoub E', 'El-Hajj R', 'Dohet C', 'Le Clech M', 'Couraud PO', 'Huber P', 'Mathieu D']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier CNRS, UMR5535, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Cadherins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Laminin', 'Metalloproteins/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteoglycans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Up-Regulation']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00493-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00493-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Apr;27(7):2687-97. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00493-06.

The proteins are regulators of physiological processes throughout the body by modulating the activity of IGF-I and IGF-II. In this article, we describe the coordinated expression of IGFBP5 and MN1 in meningiomas. MN1 is a transcriptional co-activator and we show that MN1 stimulates the IGFBP5 promoter in Hep3B cells. A CACCC-containing sequence, located 140 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the promoter, is required for MN1 action. This sequence matches with the CACCCAC consensus sequence that was selected in an oligonucleotide selection assay performed for MN1. The CACCC element has also been shown to be important for induction of the IGFBP5 promoter by retinoic acid (RA) and progesterone (Pg). We were unable to confirm the effect of Pg on the promoter in Hep3B and U2-osteosarcoma cells regardless of the presence of MN1. On the other hand, we show that induction of the promoter by RA depends on co-expressed MN1 in Hep3B cells. MN1TEL, a leukemia-related fusion protein containing parts of the MN1 and TEL (ETV6) genes, is capable of stimulating the IGFBP5 promoter but is unable to cooperate with RA in Hep3B cells.

To understand how viruses signal AID induction in the host we asked whether the AID response was abrogated in cells deficient in the interferon pathway or in signaling via the Toll-like receptors. Here we show that AID is not an interferon responsive gene and abrogation of Toll-like receptor signaling does not diminish the AID response. However, we found that NF-kappaB was required for expression of virally induced AID. Since NF-kappaB binds and activates the AID promoter, these results mechanistically link viral infection with AID transcription. Thus, induction of AID by viruses could be the result of several signaling pathways that culminate in NF-kappaB activation, underscoring the versatility of this host defense program.","['Gourzi, Polyxeni', 'Leonova, Tatyana', 'Papavasiliou, F Nina']","['Gourzi P', 'Leonova T', 'Papavasiliou FN']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cytidine Deaminase/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20061801 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20061801 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2007 Feb 19;204(2):259-65. doi: 10.1084/jem.20061801.

We analyzed 378 primary allogeneic transplants with T-replete grafts for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 101), acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 149), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 128). The cohort was divided into 3 groups: in group 1, HLA class I matched at the antigen level (n = 260); in group 2, HLA class I mismatched at the antigen level (n = 57); and in group 3, HLA class I and iKIRLs mismatched (n = 61). One-year overall survival (OS) across groups 1 (59%), 2 (49%), and 3 (30%) was significantly different (P = .002). In contrast to group 2, group 3 had statistically lower OS (P = .05) and event-free survival (P = .01). Relapse and relapse-free mortality appeared to contribute to the low OS in group 3. The detrimental effect of natural killer alloreactivity was also evident when HLA-matched transplants were analyzed for patients lacking iKIRLs. One-year OS in patients lacking the HLA-Cw group 1 or 2 iKIRL was significantly lower than that in patients having the iKIRLs (55% vs 67%, n = 246, P = .01). Our observations indicate that, in T-replete unrelated HCT, iKIRL mismatches and the absence of iKIRLs confer higher risk to patients after HCT.","['Sun, Joel Y', 'Dagis, Andrew', 'Gaidulis, Laima', 'Miller, Marcia M', 'Rodriguez, Roberto', 'Parker, Pablo', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', 'Falk, Peter', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Senitzer, David']","['Sun JY', 'Dagis A', 'Gaidulis L', 'Miller MM', 'Rodriguez R', 'Parker P', 'Nademanee A', 'Falk P', 'Rosenthal J', 'Forman SJ', 'Senitzer D']","['Division of Hematology and HCT, City of Hope National Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00645-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Feb;13(2):197-205. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.009.,['CA 33572-19S4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS) controls the IL-6/STAT-3 signaling pathway by a classic feedback loop, the aims of this study were to examine SOCS-3 regulation in human cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: SOCS-3 expression was assessed in human cholangiocarcinoma tissue and the Mz-ChA-1 and CCLP1 human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. RESULTS: An inverse correlation was observed between phospho-STAT-3 and SOCS-3 protein expression in cholangiocarcinoma. In those cancers failing to express SOCS-3, extensive methylation of the SOCS-3 promoter was demonstrated in tumor but not in paired nontumor tissue. Likewise, methylation of the socs-3 promoter was also identified in 2 cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), restored IL-6 induction of SOCS-3, terminated the phospho-STAT-3 response, and reduced cellular levels of Mcl-1. Enforced expression of SOCS-3 also reduced IL-6 induction of phospho-STAT-3 and Mcl-1. Either DAC treatment or enforced SOCS-3 expression sensitized the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: SOCS-3 epigenetic silencing is responsible for sustained IL-6/STAT-3 signaling and enhanced Mcl-1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma.","['Isomoto, Hajime', 'Mott, Justin L', 'Kobayashi, Shogo', 'Werneburg, Nathan W', 'Bronk, Steve F', 'Haan, Serge', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Isomoto H', 'Mott JL', 'Kobayashi S', 'Werneburg NW', 'Bronk SF', 'Haan S', 'Gores GJ']","['Miles & Shirley Fiterman Center for Digestive Diseases, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'CpG Islands/physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5085(06)02271-2 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2006.10.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2007 Jan;132(1):384-96. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.10.037.

METHODS: After the synthesis of L-valyl-ara-C, the in vitro stability of L-valyl-ara-C was examined in various biological media. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of ara-C and L-valyl-ara-C were also evaluated in rats. RESULTS: The degradation of L-valyl-ara-C was negligible in fresh plasma and also in the presence of plasmin over a 2 h incubation period. Furthermore, L-valyl-ara-C appeared to be stable in the leukemia cell homogenates, and subsequently, it was far less cytotoxic than the parent, ara-C in AML2 and L1210 cells. The chemical hydrolysis of L-valyl-ara-C was rather accelerated in acidic pH. Following an oral administration of L-valyl-ara-C, the appearance of ara-C was observed in plasma although the systemic exposure of the prodrug was much higher than that of ara-C. The bioavailability of ara-C was about 4% via prodrug administration.

J. Virol. 76, 7209-7219, 2002). However, the U3-deleted, self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral LTR also exhibits high transcriptional readthrough activity. Since the canonical ""core"" polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) of the lentivirus is located in the R-U5 region, the above finding suggests that additional RNA termination signals must be present in the U3 region. Insertion of alternative termination signals including panhuman T cell leukemia virus type I polyadenylation signal, a 3' end small intron, and a tertiary tRNA motif into the lentiviral SIN LTR did not restore the transcriptional termination function. Functional dissection of the U3 region revealed that 70-80% of the termination signals reside in the transcriptional control region within 124 nt overlapping NFkappaB, Sp1 and TATA binding sites. Serial deletion analysis of the transcriptional control region indicates that the lentiviral enhancer/promoter elements are essential to the RNA termination function. These results characterize the mechanism of lentiviral transcriptional readthrough, which addresses important fundamental and practical issue of RNA readthrough influencing lentiviral gene function and vector safety.","['Yang, Qing', 'Lucas, Aurore', 'Son, Sodany', 'Chang, Lung-Ji']","['Yang Q', 'Lucas A', 'Son S', 'Chang LJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Powell Gene Therapy Center and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32606, USA. qyang@ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-4-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-4 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Jan 22;4:4. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-4.,['P01 HL059412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1802088,,,,20070122,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To investigate severe hemorrhagic complications during remission induction therapy with respect to incidence, risk factors, and influence on outcome. Results were analyzed for 279 patients enrolled in the APL97 study conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG). RESULTS: Severe hemorrhage occurred in 18 patients (6.5%). Although most of them were receiving frequent transfusions, the targeted levels of platelet counts (30 x 10(9)/L) and plasma fibrinogen (1.5 g/L) for this study were reached at the day of bleeding in only 71% and 40%, respectively. Nine of them succumbed to an early death, while the remaining nine patients eventually achieved complete remission (CR). The 5-yr event-free survival rate was 68.1% for those who did not suffer severe hemorrhage, and 31.1% for those who did (P < 0.0001). For patients who achieved CR, on the other hand, there was no difference in disease-free survival between patients with and without severe hemorrhage (P = 0.6043). Risk factor analysis identified three pretreatment variables associated with severe hemorrhage: initial fibrinogen level, white blood cell count, and performance status. Additionally, patients with severe hemorrhage were more easily prone to develop retinoic acid syndrome or pneumonia than patients without hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that fatal hemorrhage represents a major obstacle in curing APL, and that patients with such high-risk features may benefit from more aggressive supportive care.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Matsushita, Tadashi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Kishimoto, Yuji', 'Tsuzuki, Motohiro', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Horikawa, Kentaro', 'Okada, Masaya', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Yagasaki, Fumiharu', 'Matsumoto, Tadashi', 'Kimura, Yukihiko', 'Shinagawa, Katsuji', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Matsushita T', 'Asou N', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Maeda Y', 'Horikawa K', 'Okada M', 'Ohtake S', 'Yagasaki F', 'Matsumoto T', 'Kimura Y', 'Shinagawa K', 'Iwanaga M', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. myanada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/complications/*etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH803 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00803.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Mar;78(3):213-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00803.x.

This article reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, and efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant studies with special emphasis on meta-analyses and direct comparisons between antifungal agents. RESULTS: The epidemiology of IFI has changed substantially in recent years with Candida albicans becoming less common owing to the widespread prophylactic use of azole antifungals. Invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis, and zygomycosis have increased in frequency. This change is at least partly related to the use of broad-spectrum antifungal agents, either as prophylaxis or as empirical treatment. Other risk factors for IFI include prior fungal exposure, immunosuppression, underlying disease, graft-vs.-host disease, and organ dysfunction. Inconsistent results have been reported in studies evaluating the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in patients at risk of IFI. Meta-analyses found that antifungals, such as fluconazole and itraconazole, are effective in decreasing IFI and IFI-related mortality, primarily owing to yeast infections in patients with more severe immunosuppression (i.e. patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation), but do not decrease the overall mortality. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines currently recommend fluconazole (AI, ie. strongly recommended, based on at least 1 well-executed, randomized trial) and itraconazole (BI, ie. generally recommended, based on at least 1 well-executed, randomized trial) in allogeneic transplant recipients. Posaconazole, a triazole antifungal, has been recently shown to decrease IFI incidence and overall mortality in some high-risk patients compared with standard azoles. Based on preliminary data, a provisional AI ECIL recommendation has been given. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with IFI, there is a need to accurately define patient groups at greatest risk of IFI and, when appropriate, to initiate effective antifungal prophylaxis.","['Maertens, Johan']",['Maertens J'],"['University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. johan.maertens@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH805 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00805.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Apr;78(4):275-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00805.x.

Cyclin E, a proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in many human cancers, mediates the G(1) to S transition, is a potential target of curcumin. We demonstrate in this report a dose- and time-dependent down-regulation of expression of cyclin E by curcumin that correlates with the decrease in the proliferation of human prostate and breast cancer cells. The suppression of cyclin E expression was not cell type dependent as down-regulation occurred in estrogen-positive and -negative breast cancer cells, androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, leukemia and lymphoma cells, head and neck carcinoma cells, and lung cancer cells. Curcumin-induced down-regulation of cyclin E was reversed by proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal, suggesting the role of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. We found that curcumin enhanced the expression of tumor cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as tumor suppressor protein p53 but suppressed the expression of retinoblastoma protein. Curcumin also induced the accumulation of the cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Overall, our results suggest that proteasome-mediated down-regulation of cyclin E and up-regulation of CDK inhibitors may contribute to the antiproliferative effects of curcumin against various tumors.","['Aggarwal, Bharat B', 'Banerjee, Sanjeev', 'Bharadwaj, Uddalak', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Shishodia, Shishir', 'Sethi, Gautam']","['Aggarwal BB', 'Banerjee S', 'Bharadwaj U', 'Sung B', 'Shishodia S', 'Sethi G']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. aggarwal@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin E/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00818-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Apr 1;73(7):1024-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.12.010.

We studied the plasma SDF-1 levels in 90 patients with suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and we found that circulating SDF-1 was significantly increased in the overt DIC patients and was also increased in overt DIC patients who have a poor outcome. We then tested in vitro whether SDF-1 can affect the expression of monocyte tissue factor (TF) and endothelial thrombomodulin (TM), and both of these play important roles in coagulopathy. SDF-1 did not affect the expression of surface TF protein and its function and the TF mRNA level in both monocytes and the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. SDF-1 also did not change the surface TM expression of endothelial cells. SDF-1 could enhance low-dose ADP induced platelet aggregation, although it failed by itself to induce aggregation.

Immunoelectron microscopy reveals that they all possess a filamentous core and, in some, this is surrounded by a granular shell. We further demonstrate that a proportion of INRs in extranigral sites also show partial immunoreactivity for PML.

METHODS: We used data from the cancer registries from Singapore and from 12 low-incidence areas, including a total of 8,947 first occurring NPC cases, and 167 second occurring cases. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by comparing the second cancer incidence in NPC patients to the first primary cancer incidence in non-cancer population. We also calculated SIRs of second NPC after other primaries. RESULTS: In Singapore, the risk of cancers of the lung (SIR=0.42), stomach (SIR=0.41), and colon (SIR=0.23) was significantly decreased after NPC, whereas that of cancer of the tongue (SIR=11.1) was significantly increased. In Australia, Canada, and Europe, the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (SIR=3.06), tongue cancer (SIR=5.29), brain cancer (SIR=3.89), myeloid leukemia (SIR=3.85), and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (SIR=3.47) was significantly increased after NPC. Incidences of second occurring NPCs following various primary cancers were not significantly altered compared to the incidence of first occurring NPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Immune suppression (NHL, NMSC), shared genetic factors (lung cancer, NHL, myeloid leukemia), and shared environmental risk factors (tongue and brain cancers) might explain the associations.

Although it was initially predicted to be involved in the cyclin D-Rb pathway, overexpression of Dmp1 in primary cells induces cell cycle arrest in an Arf, p53-dependent fashion. Dmp1 is a unique Arf regulator, the promoter of which is activated by oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling. Dmp1 expression is repressed by physiological mitogenic stimuli as well as by overexpressed E2F proteins; thus, it is a novel marker of cells that have exited from the cell cycle. Spontaneous and oncogene-induced tumor formation is accelerated in both Dmp1(+/-) and Dmp1(-/-) mice; the Dmp1(+/-) tumors often retain and express the wild-type allele; thus, Dmp1 is haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression. Tumors from Dmp1(+/-) and Dmp1(-/-) mice often retain wild-type Arf and p53, suggesting that Dmp1 is a physiological regulator of the Arf-p53 pathway. The human DMP1 (hDMP1) gene is located on chromosome 7q21, the locus of which is often deleted in myeloid leukemia and also in some types of solid tumors.

Our previous studies using a murine fetal liver transplantation model demonstrated that TEL-AML1 promotes the self-renewal of B-cell precursors in vitro and enhances the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. This is consistent with the hypothesis that TEL-AML1 induces expansion of a preleukemic clone. Several studies have described domains within TEL-AML1 involved in the transcriptional regulation of specific target genes. However, it is unclear which of these domains is important for the activity of TEL-AML1 in preleukemic hematopoiesis. In order to examine this, we have generated a panel of deletion mutants and expressed them in HSCs. These experiments demonstrate that TEL-AML1 requires multiple domains from both TEL and AML1 to alter hematopoiesis. Furthermore, mutation of a single amino-acid residue within the runt homology domain of AML1, required for DNA binding, was sufficient to abrogate TEL-AML1 activity. These data suggest that TEL-AML1 acts as an aberrant transcription factor to perturb multiple pathways during hematopoiesis.","['Morrow, M', 'Samanta, A', 'Kioussis, D', 'Brady, H J M', 'Williams, O']","['Morrow M', 'Samanta A', 'Kioussis D', 'Brady HJ', 'Williams O']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*chemistry/physiology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/physiology', 'Preleukemia/*etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210227 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210227 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jun 28;26(30):4404-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210227.

The prevalence of inherited and acquired prothrombotic risk factors and the incidence of symptomatic TE were evaluated in a cohort of 114 adult acute leukemia patients. The most frequent prothrombotic risk factor was hyperhomocysteinemia which occurred in 46.6% of patients. The incidence of TE was 9.6%, mainly in the first month of follow-up. In multivariate analysis, hyperhomocysteinemia was the only risk factor for TE (OR 33.90; 95% CI 1.53-751.33; p = 0.026).

Thus natural ligands for CD69 not yet identified and/or the anti-CD69 autoantibodies possibly affect neutrophils by evoking CD69 signaling, which may further affect joint-composing cells in RA. However, the effect of the CD69 signaling in neutrophils remains largely unclear. To elucidate the issue, we tried to identify proteins affected by the crosslinking of CD69 on neutrophils using a proteomic approach. Specifically, CD69 on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-activated neutrophils was crosslinked by anti-CD69 monoclonal antibodies, and then intracellular proteins were detected using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and further identified by mass spectrometry and subsequent protein database searching. As a result, we successfully identified multiple proteins that increased their production by the CD69 signaling. Among the proteins, we focused on one of the up-regulated proteins, S100A9 calcium binding protein (S100A9), and investigated proteome changes brought by a recombinant S100A9 in a human synovial sarcoma cell line (SW982), a human chondrosarcoma cell line (OUMS-27), and a human T leukemia cell line (Jurkat). This revealed that the recombinant S100A9 altered proteomes of SW982 and OUMS-27, and to a lesser extent, that of the Jurkat cells. Further, S100A9 induced IL-1beta production from neutrophils and the SW982 cells. These data suggest that unidentified natural ligands for CD69 and/or the anti-CD69 autoantibodies possibly affect joint-composing cell types through the increased production of S100A9 in neutrophils, providing a new insight into functions of CD69 on neutrophils in RA.","['Shimada, Sonoko', 'Nakamura, Manabu', 'Tanaka, Yasuhiko', 'Tsutsumi, Kouichiro', 'Katano, Masayoshi', 'Masuko, Kayo', 'Yudoh, Kazuo', 'Koizuka, Izumi', 'Kato, Tomohiro']","['Shimada S', 'Nakamura M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tsutsumi K', 'Katano M', 'Masuko K', 'Yudoh K', 'Koizuka I', 'Kato T']","['Department of Bioregulation and Proteomics, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proteome)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Calgranulin B/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Ligands', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Proteome/analysis']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/mandi/51.87 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1348-0421.2007.tb03878.x [doi]']",ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2007;51(1):87-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2007.tb03878.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two alleles including HLA-DRB4 and -DQB1*0303 were found to be significantly decreased in patients compared to controls.

We examined whether the growth kinetics of MCF-7 cells might determine the level of up-regulation of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 or CYP1B1 by B[a]P, and whether this could then influence subsequent levels of DNA damage. Cell cultures manipulated to be G(0)/G(1)-phase concentrated, S-phase concentrated or G(2)/M-phase concentrated were treated with B[a]P and the expression levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A [CDKN1A (P21(WAF1/CIP1))], B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), and Bcl-2-associated X levels were determined. Levels of DNA damage were measured as DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay or as DNA adducts by (32)P-postlabelling analysis. B[a]P-induced up-regulation of CYP1A1 was >100-fold in S-phase-concentrated cells, but in G(0)/G(1)-phase- or G(2)/M-phase-concentrated cultures up-regulation occurred to a significantly lower extent. Consistent with this, B[a]P-treated S-phase-concentrated cultures exhibited markedly up-regulated P21(WAF1/CIP1), higher levels of dose-related increases in DNA SSBs, and increased DNA adduct levels presumably as a result of CYP1A1-mediated activation of B[a]P to B[a]P-diol-epoxide compared with the cultures enriched for the other cell cycle phases. Growth kinetics in vitro may be an important predeterminant of susceptibility to an exogenous pro-carcinogen in short-term test systems and these findings have important implications when extrapolating such results to a particular target-cell population in vivo.","['Jiao, Haiyan', 'Allinson, Sarah L', 'Walsh, Michael J', 'Hewitt, Rebecca', 'Cole, Kathy J', 'Phillips, David H', 'Martin, Francis L']","['Jiao H', 'Allinson SL', 'Walsh MJ', 'Hewitt R', 'Cole KJ', 'Phillips DH', 'Martin FL']","['Biomedical Sciences Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",IM,"['Benzo(a)pyrene/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comet Assay', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Adducts/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2007/01/24 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2007/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['gel060 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gel060 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2007 Mar;22(2):111-6. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gel060.

Colony formation assays indicated that a 24 h exposure of L1210 cells to XK469 or SH80 inhibited clonogenic growth with CI(90) values of 10 and 13 micromol/L, respectively. This effect was associated with G(2)-M arrest and the absence of any detectable markers of apoptosis (i.e., plasma membrane blebbing, procaspase 3 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and formation of condensed chromatin). Drug-treated cells increased in size and eventually exhibited the characteristics of autophagy (i.e., appearance of autophagosomes and conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I to 3-II). The absence of apoptosis was not related to an inhibition of the apoptotic program. Cultures treated with XK469 or SH80 readily underwent apoptosis upon exposure to the Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonist ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate. Continued incubation of drug-treated cells led to a reciprocal loss of large autophagic cells and the appearance of smaller cells that could not be stained with Hoechst dye HO33342, had a chaotic morphology, were trypan blue-permeable, and lacked mitochondrial membrane potential. L1210 cells cotreated with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, or having reduced Atg7 protein content, underwent G(2)-M arrest, but not autophagy, following XK469 treatment.

Here, we showed that phytosphingosine treatment in combination with arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) enhanced cell death of naturally As(2)O(3)-resistant human myeloid leukemia cells. The combination treatment induced an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species level, mitochondrial relocalization of Bax, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a thiol-containing antioxidant, completely blocked Bax relocalization, PARP-1 activation, and cytochrome c release. Pretreatment of 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone, a PARP-1 inhibitor, or PARP-1/small interfering RNA partially attenuated cytochrome c release, whereas the same treatment did not affect Bax relocalization. The combination treatment induced selective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Inhibition of p38 MAPK by treatment of SB203580 or expression of dominant-negative forms of p38 MAPK suppressed the combination treatment-induced Bax relocalization but did not affect PARP-1 activation. In addition, antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine completely blocked p38 MAPK activation. These results indicate that phytosphingosine in combination with As(2)O(3) induces synergistic apoptosis in As(2)O(3)-resistant leukemia cells through the p38 MAPK-mediated mitochondrial translocation of Bax and the PARP-1 activation, and that p38 MAPK and PARP-1 activations are reactive oxygen species dependent.

A Phase II study was performed on low-dose decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, in combination with imatinib in patients with CML in accelerated phase (AP) and myeloid blastic phase (BP). METHODS: Patients received decitabine 15 mg/m(2) intravenously daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, and imatinib 600 mg orally daily. Global DNA methylation was measured by long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) bisulfite/pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled (25 with imatinib resistance; 18 in AP, 10 in BP). A total of 91 cycles (median, 2.5 cycles per patient) was administered. Complete hematologic responses, partial hematologic responses, and hematologic improvement were observed in 9 (32%), 1 (4%), and 2 (7%) patients. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 5 (18%) and 3 (11%) patients. The hematologic response rate was higher in patients without BCR-ABL kinase mutations (10 of 19, 53%) than in those with mutations (1 of 7, 14%). Median duration of hematologic response was 18 (range, 4 to 107+) weeks. Myelosuppression was the major adverse effect, with neutropenic fever in 9 patients (32%). LINE methylation decreased from 71.6% +/- 0.9% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 60.4% +/- 2.0% on Day 5, 60.5% +/- 1.8% on Day 12, and returned to 68.8% +/- 1.4% at peripheral blood recovery. A decrease in LINE methylation tended to be greater in nonresponders than in responders on Days 5 and 12. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with decitabine and imatinib is well tolerated and active in advanced phase CML without BCR-ABL kinase mutations.","['Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Gharibyan, Vazganush', 'Jones, Dan', ""O'brien, Susan"", 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Morris, Gail M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Oki Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Gharibyan V', 'Jones D', ""O'brien S"", 'Verstovsek S', 'Cortes J', 'Morris GM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

We constructed two packaging cell lines based on the human suspension T-cell lymphoma line Deltabeta-Jurkat, which lacks endogenous TCRbeta-chains and is therefore unable to express CD3 complexes on the cell surface. After supply of gag-pol (murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV)) and env (GALV or MLV-10A1) genes, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding retrovirus vector was transduced into both packaging cell clones, which then stably produced GFP-retroviruses with titers of up to 4 x 10(5) infectious particles (IP)/ml. After transfer of a TCRalpha/beta-encoding retrovirus vector, Deltabeta-Jurkat/GALV and Deltabeta-Jurkat/10A1 cells expressed CD3 molecules on the cell surface. CD3-high expressing packaging cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting. In these cells, the CD3 expression level directly correlated with the titer of vector particles.

We investigated the role of interleukin (IL)-8 and growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)-alpha in the chemotactic transmigration of ATRA-treated NB4 (ATRA-NB4) APL cells toward A549 alveolar epithelial cells. DESIGN: An in vitro human cell culture study. SETTING: University hospital research laboratories. SUBJECTS: NB4 and A549 cells. INTERVENTIONS: NB4 and A549 cells were separately cultured with ATRA and/or dexamethasone for 1-3 days. NB4 or ATRA-NB4 cells were then placed in an upper insert and co-incubated with A549 cells or their conditioned medium located in a lower plate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ATRA stimulated NB4 cells to transmigrate toward the A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Replacement of A459 condition medium by its original medium abrogated this transmigration. Only A549 cells constitutively secreted GRO-alpha, and both A549 and NB4 cells constitutively secreted IL-8, which was enhanced by ATRA. Exogenous administration of IL-8 or GRO-alpha also promoted the ATRA-NB4 transmigration. The binding assay demonstrated that ATRA-NB4 cells bound IL-8, but not GRO-alpha, more avidly. Pretreatment with antibodies directed against IL-8 and GRO-alpha receptors reduced ATRA-NB4 transmigration by about 60%. Dexamethasone did not suppress their IL-8 secretion and transmigration in ATRA-NB4 cells, but when applied to A549 cells, IL-8 secretion was suppressed but not GRO-alpha secretion, and there was attenuation of ATRA-NB4 transmigration. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and GRO-alpha secreted from alveolar epithelial cells play an important role in the cell-cell interaction involved in the chemotactic transmigration of ATRA-treated APL cells toward alveolar epithelial cells.","['Tsai, Wen-Hui', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi', 'Lin, Chiou-Chyn', 'Ho, Chi-Kuan', 'Kou, Yu Ru']","['Tsai WH', 'Hsu HC', 'Lin CC', 'Ho CK', 'Kou YR']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL1', 'Chemokines, CXC/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-8/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*drug effects/immunology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*toxicity']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.CCM.0000256844.38259.27 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2007 Mar;35(3):879-85. doi: 10.1097/01.CCM.0000256844.38259.27.,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2007 Mar;35(3):974-5.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between statin use and various types of cancer in our hospital-based case-control surveillance study. METHODS: Data were collected from patients ages 40-79 years who were admitted to participating hospitals in 3 centers in Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore from 1991 to 2005. Nurses administered questionnaires to obtain information on medication use and other factors. We compared patients who had any of 10 types of cancer (a total of 4913 patients) with controls admitted for noncancer diagnoses (3900 patients). The following cancers were examined individually: female breast (n = 1185), prostate (n = 1226), colorectal (n = 734), lung (n = 464), bladder (n = 240), leukemia (n = 254), pancreas (n = 220), kidney (n = 226), endometrial (n = 220), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 144). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals among regular statin users compared with never-users. RESULTS: Odds ratios were compatible with 1.0 for all cancer types. For the 4 largest cancer sites (breast, prostate, colorectum, and lung), odds ratios did not vary significantly by duration of statin use. CONCLUSIONS: Statins are among the most commonly used medications, and durations of use are increasing. The present data do not support either positive or negative associations between statin use and the occurrence of 10 cancer types. Cancer incidence should continue to be monitored among statin users.","['Coogan, Patricia F', 'Rosenberg, Lynn', 'Strom, Brian L']","['Coogan PF', 'Rosenberg L', 'Strom BL']","['Slone Epidemiology Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. pcoogan@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.ede.0000254694.03027.a1 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2007 Mar;18(2):213-9. doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000254694.03027.a1.,['R01 CA45762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Epidemiology. 2007 Mar;18(2):194-6.

Serum samples from up to 30 randomly selected cows from 342 herds on monthly milk testing were tested for antibodies against BLV (IDEXX ELISA; IDEXX Corporation, Westbrook, ME), MAP (IDEXX or Biocor ELISA; Biocor Animal Health, Inc., Omaha, NE), and NC (IDEXX or Biovet ELISA; Biovet Inc., St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada). Up to 5 unvaccinated cattle over 6 mo of age were tested for virus-neutralizing antibodies to the Singer strain of type 1 BVDV. Dairy Herd Improvement records were obtained electronically for all sampled cows. Linear mixed models with herd and cow as random variables were fit, with significant restricted maximum likelihood estimates of outcome effects being obtained, while controlling for potential confounding variables. Bovine leukemia virus seropositivity was not associated with 305-d milk, 305-d fat, or 305-d protein production. Cows in BVDV-seropositive herds (at least one unvaccinated animal with a titer > or =1:64) had reductions in 305-d milk, fat, and protein of 368, 10.2, and 9.5 kg, respectively, compared with cows in BVDV-seronegative herds. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis seropositivity was associated with lower 305-d milk of 212 kg in 4+-lactation cows compared with MAP-seronegative 4+-lactation cows. Neospora caninum seropositivity in primiparous cows was associated with lower 305-d milk, fat, and protein of 158, 5.5, and 3.3 kg, respectively, compared with NC-seronegative primiparous cows. There were no interactions among seropositivity for any of the pathogens and their effects on any of the outcomes examined, although the low MAP seroprevalence limited this analysis. Results from this research will contribute to understanding the economic impacts of these pathogens and justify their control.","['Tiwari, A', 'Vanleeuwen, J A', 'Dohoo, I R', 'Keefe, G P', 'Haddad, J P', 'Tremblay, R', 'Scott, H M', 'Whiting, T']","['Tiwari A', 'Vanleeuwen JA', 'Dohoo IR', 'Keefe GP', 'Haddad JP', 'Tremblay R', 'Scott HM', 'Whiting T']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, Canada C1A 4P3. atiwari@upei.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Milk Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease/microbiology/*physiopathology', 'Canada', 'Cattle', 'Coccidiosis/parasitology/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/immunology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/microbiology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Lactation/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Milk/chemistry', 'Milk Proteins/analysis', 'Mycobacterium/immunology', 'Neospora/immunology', 'Paratuberculosis/microbiology/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-0302(07)71548-5 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(07)71548-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2007 Feb;90(2):659-69. doi: 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(07)71548-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we constructed a full-length XMRV genome from prostate tissue RNA and showed that the molecular viral clone is replication-competent. XMRV replication in the prostate cancer cell line DU145 was sensitive to inhibition by IFN-beta. However, LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which are deficient in JAK1 and RNase L, were resistant to the effects of IFN-beta against XMRV. Furthermore, DU145 cells rendered deficient in RNase L with siRNA were partially resistant to IFN inhibition of XMRV. Expression in hamster cells of the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 allowed these cells to be infected by XMRV. XMRV provirus integration sites were mapped in DNA isolated from human prostate tumor tissue to genes for two transcription factors (NFATc3 and CREB5) and to a gene encoding a suppressor of androgen receptor transactivation (APPBP2/PAT1/ARA67).

Here, we show that Mcl-1 down-regulation by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine or Mcl-1-shRNA dramatically increases ABT-737 lethality in human leukemia cells. ABT-737 induces Bax conformational change but fails to activate Bak or trigger Bax translocation. Coadministration of roscovitine and ABT-737 untethers Bak from Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, respectively, triggering Bak activation and Bax translocation. Studies employing Bax and/or Bak knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) confirm that Bax is required for ABT-737+/-roscovitine lethality, whereas Bak is primarily involved in potentiation of ABT-737-induced apoptosis by Mcl-1 down-regulation. Ectopic Mcl-1 expression attenuates Bak activation and apoptosis by ABT-737+roscovitine, whereas cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL remain fully sensitive. Finally, Mcl-1 knockout MEFs are extremely sensitive to Bak conformational change and apoptosis induced by ABT-737, effects that are not potentiated by roscovitine. Collectively, these findings suggest down-regulation of Mcl-1 by either CDK inhibitors or genetic approaches dramatically potentiate ABT-737 lethality through cooperative interactions at two distinct levels: unleashing of Bak from both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 and simultaneous induction of Bak activation and Bax translocation. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for simultaneously targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in leukemia.","['Chen, Shuang', 'Dai, Yun', 'Harada, Hisashi', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Chen S', 'Dai Y', 'Harada H', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Purines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Roscovitine', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/2/782 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3964 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;67(2):782-91. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3964.,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the functional role of ILK activation in leukemic and bone marrow stromal cells on their direct contact. Coculture of leukemic NB4 cells with bone marrow-derived stromal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) resulted in robust activation of multiple signaling pathways, including ILK/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Notch1/Hes. Blockade of PI3K or ILK signaling with pharmacologic inhibitors LY294002 or QLT0267 specifically inhibited stroma-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, suppressed STAT3 and ERK1/2 activation, and decreased Notch1 and Hes1 expression in leukemic cells. This resulted in induction of apoptosis in both leukemic cell lines and in primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples that was not abrogated by MSC coculture. In turn, leukemic cells growing in direct contact with bone marrow stromal elements induce activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3 signaling in MSC, accompanied by significant increase in Hes1 and Bcl-2 proteins, which were all suppressed by QLT0267 and LY294002. In summary, our results indicate reciprocal activation of ILK/Akt in both leukemic and bone marrow stromal cells. We propose that ILK/Akt is a proximal signaling pathway critical for survival of leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Hence, disruption of these interactions by ILK inhibitors represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy to eradicate leukemia in the bone marrow microenvironment by simultaneous targeting of both leukemic cells and activated bone marrow stromal cells.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Jin, Linhua', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii, Yuko', 'Xu, Yuanyuan', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Nagaoka, Isao', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Tabe Y', 'Jin L', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii Y', 'Xu Y', 'McQueen T', 'Priebe W', 'Mills GB', 'Ohsaka A', 'Nagaoka I', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (integrin-linked kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/2/684 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3166 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;67(2):684-94. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3166.,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to null mutations, many of the mutations generate Runx1 DNA-binding (RDB) mutants. To determine if these mutants antagonize wild-type protein activity, cDNAs were transduced into murine bone marrow or human cord blood cells using retroviral vectors. Significantly, the RDB mutants did not act in a transdominant fashion in vivo to disrupt Runx1 activity in either T-cell or platelet development, which are highly sensitive to Runx1 dosage. However, RDB mutant expression impaired expansion and differentiation of the erythroid compartment in which Runx1 expression is normally down-regulated, showing that a RDB-independent function is incompatible with erythroid differentiation. Significantly, both bone marrow progenitors expressing RDB mutants or deficient for Runx1 showed increased replating efficiencies in vitro, accompanied by the accumulation of myeloblasts and dysplastic progenitors, but the effect was more pronounced in RDB cultures. Disruption of the interface that binds CBFbeta, an important cofactor of Runx1, did not impair RDB mutant replating activity, arguing against inactivation of Runx1 function by CBFbeta sequestration. We propose that RDB mutants antagonize Runx1 function in early progenitors by disrupting a critical balance between DNA-binding-independent and DNA-binding-dependent signaling.","['Cammenga, Jorg', 'Niebuhr, Birte', 'Horn, Stefan', 'Bergholz, Ulla', 'Putz, Gabriele', 'Buchholz, Frank', 'Lohler, Jurgen', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Cammenga J', 'Niebuhr B', 'Horn S', 'Bergholz U', 'Putz G', 'Buchholz F', 'Lohler J', 'Stocking C']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/2/537 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1903 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 15;67(2):537-45. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study shows that the absence of TC-PTP leads to an early bone marrow B-cell deficiency characterized by hindered transition from the pre-B cell to immature B-cell stage. This phenotype is intrinsic to the B cells but most importantly due to bone marrow stroma abnormalities. We found that bone marrow stromal cells from TC-PTP(-/-) mice have the unique property of secreting 232-890 pg/mL IFN-gamma. These high levels of IFN-gamma result in 2-fold reduction in mitotic index on IL-7 stimulation of TC-PTP(-/-) pre-B cells and lower responsiveness of IL-7 receptor downstream Jak/Stat signaling molecules. Moreover, we noted constitutive phosphorylation of Stat1 in those pre-B cells and demonstrated that this was due to soluble IFN-gamma secreted by TC-PTP(-/-) bone marrow stromal cells. Interestingly, culturing murine early pre-B leukemic cells within a TC-PTP-deficient bone marrow stroma environment leads to a 40% increase in apoptosis in these malignant cells. Our results unraveled a new role for TC-PTP in normal B lymphopoiesis and suggest that modulation of bone marrow microenvironment is a potential therapeutic approach for selected B-cell leukemia.","['Bourdeau, Annie', 'Dube, Nadia', 'Heinonen, Krista M', 'Theberge, Jean-Francois', 'Doody, Karen M', 'Tremblay, Michel L']","['Bourdeau A', 'Dube N', 'Heinonen KM', 'Theberge JF', 'Doody KM', 'Tremblay ML']","['McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41542-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-044370 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4220-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-044370.

In transgenic mice we show that the expression of HOXA10 is tightly regulated by doxycycline. Intermediate concentrations of HOXA10 induced a 15-fold increase in the repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) after 13 days of in vitro culture. Notably, the proliferation induction of HSC by HOXA10 was dependent on the HOXA10 concentration, because high levels of HOXA10 had no effect on HSC proliferation. Furthermore, high levels of HOXA10 blocked erythroid and megakaryocyte development, demonstrating that tight regulation of HOXA10 is critical for normal development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. The HOXA10-mediated effects on hematopoietic cells were associated with altered expression of genes that govern stem-cell self-renewal and lineage commitment (eg, hepatic leukemia factor [HlF], Dickkopf-1 [Dkk-1], growth factor independent-1 [Gfi-1], and Gata-1). Interestingly, binding sites for HOXA10 were found in HLF, Dkk-1, and Gata-1, and Dkk-1 and Gfi-1 were transcriptionally activated by HOXA10.

We studied 590 patients who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HSCT at our institution, and on whom a pretransplantation serum ferritin was available. An elevated pretransplantation serum ferritin level was strongly associated with lower overall and disease-free survival. Subgroup multivariable analyses demonstrated that this association was restricted to patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); in the latter group, the inferior survival was attributable to a significant increase in TRM. There was also a trend toward an increased risk of veno-occlusive disease in patients with high ferritin. Our results argue that iron overload plays an important role in transplantation outcome for patients with acute leukemia or MDS, as it does in thalassemia.

To identify methylation-silenced genes in AML, we performed microarray analyses in U937 cells exposed to the demethylating agent 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine. Overall, 274 transcripts were significantly induced. Interestingly, C/EBPdelta expression was significantly induced (more than 10-fold) by demethylation whereas expression of all other C/EBP family members remained unchanged. The C/EBPdelta promoter was strongly methylated in different leukemic cell lines and showed signs of a repressed chromatin state. Analyses of the promoter regions of the entire C/EBP family (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta) in bone marrow samples from AML patients (n = 80) and controls (n = 15) by mass spectrometry revealed that C/EBPdelta is the most commonly hypermethylated C/EBP gene in AML. Hypermethylation occurred in more than 35% of AML patients at primary diagnosis. A significant correlation (P = .016) was observed between hypermethylation of the C/EBPdelta promoter and low expression of C/EBPdelta in AML patients. C/EBPdelta promoter activity was strongly repressed by methylation in vitro, and transcriptional repression partially depended on MeCP2 activity. C/EBPdelta exhibited growth-inhibitory properties in primary progenitor cells as well as in Flt3-ITD-transformed cells. Taken together, C/EBPdelta is a novel tumor suppressor gene in AML that is silenced by promoter methylation.","['Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Tidow, Nicola', 'Ehrich, Mathias', 'van den Boom, Dirk', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Agrawal S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Tidow N', 'Ehrich M', 'van den Boom D', 'Koschmieder S', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Domagkstrasse 3, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects/genetics', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41638-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-040147 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 1;109(9):3895-905. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-040147.

We used gene expression profiling over time to build temporal models of gene transcription after B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in healthy and malignant B cells and chose this as a model since BCR cross-linking induces both cell proliferation and apoptosis, with increased apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to healthy B cells. To determine the basis for this, we examined the global temporal gene expression profile for BCR stimulation and developed a linear combination method to summarize the effect of BCR simulation over all the time points for all patients. Functional learning identified common early events in healthy B cells and CLL cells. Although healthy and malignant B cells share a common genetic pattern early after BCR signaling, a specific genetic program is engaged by the malignant cells at later time points after BCR stimulation. These findings identify the molecular basis for the different functional consequences of BCR cross-linking in healthy and malignant B cells.

We examined whether rat HO-1 cDNA transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells have altered cytokine production in response to stimulation with anti-ovalbumin (OA) serum/OA compared to Mock transfected RBL-2H3 cells. HO-1 inhibited anti-OA serum/OA-induced IL-3 and TNF-alpha production. Inhibition of HO-1 activity by Zn (II) protoporphyrin IX, a specific HO-1 inhibitor, prevented the suppression of TNF-alpha production. The cytokine inhibition by HO-1 was associated with selective suppression of the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 transcription factors. The suppression of mast cell cytokine production by HO-1 may be an important aspect of the processes that lead to resolution of allergic inflammation.","['Yasui, Yumiko', 'Nakamura, Mao', 'Onda, Toshihiro', 'Uehara, Tomohiro', 'Murata, Saori', 'Matsui, Nobuaki', 'Fukuishi, Nobuyuki', 'Akagi, Reiko', 'Suematsu, Makoto', 'Akagi, Masaaki']","['Yasui Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Onda T', 'Uehara T', 'Murata S', 'Matsui N', 'Fukuishi N', 'Akagi R', 'Suematsu M', 'Akagi M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, 180 Nishihama-bouji, Tokushima-shi, Tokushima 770-8514, Japan. yumikoy@ph.bunri-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Hypersensitivity/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Inflammation/enzymology/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/04/11 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)00015-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.228 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Mar 9;354(2):485-90. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.228.

There are four major types of leukemia: acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There is a growing amount of literature of the health economic aspects of leukemia. However, no comprehensive review is yet performed on the health economic evidence for the disease. Hence, our aim was to review and analyze the existing literature on economic evaluations of the different types of leukemia. METHODS: A systematic literature search used electronic databases to identify published cost analyses and economic evaluations of leukemia treatments. After reviewing all identified studies, sixty studies were considered relevant for the purpose of the review. RESULTS: The identified studies were published after 1990, with a few exceptions. Many of the identified economic evaluations in leukemia, particularly for ALL and AML, may be defined as cost-minimization analyses, where only the costs of different treatment strategies are compared. In CML, a new treatment, imatinib, was introduced in 2001 and several cost-effectiveness analyses have since then been conducted comparing imatinib with previous first line treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that there is a shortage of cost-effectiveness information in leukemia. The introduction of new therapies will stress the need for new economic evaluations in this group of diseases. More information about the total costs, that is, including indirect costs, and quality of life effects would be valuable in future evaluations in leukemia.","['Kasteng, Frida', 'Sobocki, Patrik', 'Svedman, Christer', 'Lundkvist, Jonas']","['Kasteng F', 'Sobocki P', 'Svedman C', 'Lundkvist J']","['European Health Economics, Vasagatan 38, Stockholm 111 20, Sweden. frida.k@healtheconomics.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,International journal of technology assessment in health care,8508113,,IM,"['*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*economics/therapy', 'United States']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0266462307051562 [pii]', '10.1017/S0266462307051562 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2007 Winter;23(1):43-53. doi: 10.1017/S0266462307051562.,,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we propose and evaluate an approach to find functional associations between large numbers of genes and other biomedical concepts from free-text literature. For each gene, a profile of related concepts is constructed that summarizes the context in which the gene is mentioned in literature. We assign a weight to each concept in the profile based on a likelihood ratio measure. Gene concept profiles can then be clustered to find related genes and other concepts. RESULTS: The experimental validation was done in two steps. We first applied our method on a controlled test set. After this proved to be successful the datasets from two DNA microarray experiments were analyzed in the same way and the results were evaluated by domain experts. The first dataset was a gene-expression profile that characterizes the cancer cells of a group of acute myeloid leukemia patients. For this group of patients the biological background of the cancer cells is largely unknown. Using our methodology we found an association of these cells to monocytes, which agreed with other experimental evidence. The second data set consisted of differentially expressed genes following androgen receptor stimulation in a prostate cancer cell line. Based on the analysis we put forward a hypothesis about the biological processes induced in these studied cells: secretory lysosomes are involved in the production of prostatic fluid and their development and/or secretion are androgen-regulated processes. CONCLUSION: Our method can be used to analyze DNA microarray datasets based on information explicitly and implicitly available in the literature. We provide a publicly available tool, dubbed Anni, for this purpose.","['Jelier, Rob', 'Jenster, Guido', 'Dorssers, Lambert C J', 'Wouters, Bas J', 'Hendriksen, Peter J M', 'Mons, Barend', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Kors, Jan A']","['Jelier R', 'Jenster G', 'Dorssers LC', 'Wouters BJ', 'Hendriksen PJ', 'Mons B', 'Delwel R', 'Kors JA']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus MC--University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. r.jelier@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/*analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-8-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-8-14 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 Jan 18;8:14. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-8-14.,,PMC1784107,,,,20070118,,"['GEO/GSE1159', 'GEO/GSE4027']",,,,,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) is a fatal T-cell malignancy caused by infection with human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I), and remains incurable. ATL is associated with osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcaemia, both of which are major factors in the morbidity of ATL. Thus, the search for anti-ATL agents that have both anti-tumour and anti-resorptive activity is warranted. The bisphosphonate agent, incadronate, prevented cell growth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells, but not of non-infected T-cell lines or normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Incadronate induced S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, and treatment of these cells with substrates of the mevalonate pathway blocked the incadronate-mediated growth suppression. Incadronate also prevented the prenylation of Rap1A protein. These results demonstrated that incadronate-induced growth suppression occurs by interfering with the mevalonate pathway. Importantly, treatment with incadronate reduced tumour formation from an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line when these cells were inoculated subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficient mice. These findings suggest that incadronate could be potentially useful for the treatment of ATL.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Tomita, Mariko', 'Kawakami, Hirochika', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Ohta, Takao', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Matsuda T', 'Okudaira T', 'Tomita M', 'Kawakami H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Masuda M', 'Ohshiro K', 'Ohta T', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '138330-18-4 (cimadronate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6445 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06445.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(3):424-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06445.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, it was previously reported that adhesion of haematopoietic tumour cells to fibronectin (FN) via beta1 integrins confers a multi-drug resistance phenotype commonly referred to as cell adhesion mediated drug resistance. The present study showed that the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member Bim was reduced when leukaemia cells were adherent to FN via beta1 integrins. beta1 integrin-mediated regulation of Bim in K562 cells was demonstrated to be partly a result of increased proteasomal-mediated degradation of Bim protein levels, and proteasome inhibitors prevent Bim degradation. Increased degradation of Bim was not related to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as adhesion of K562 cells caused a reduction in phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 levels. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of MAP/ERK (MEK) with PD98059 did not increase Bim levels. Reducing Bim levels by short hairpin RNA targeting inhibited imatinib and mitoxantrone-induced cell death. These results showed that beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion regulates Bim degradation and may contribute to the minimal residual disease associated with many haematopoietic malignancies. Together our data indicate that disrupting beta1 integrin-mediated regulation of Bim degradation may increase the efficacy of drugs, including imatinib, used to treat haematopoietic malignancies.","['Hazlehurst, L A', 'Argilagos, R F', 'Dalton, W S']","['Hazlehurst LA', 'Argilagos RF', 'Dalton WS']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology and Experimental Therapeutics Program, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. hazlehla@moffitt.usf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Integrin beta1/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6435 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06435.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jan;136(2):269-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06435.x.,['CA76292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of patients from the Czech Acute Leukemia Clinical Register (ALERT).,89-94,"To assess the prognostic relevance of activating mutations of FLT3 gene on outcome of allogeneic transplantations in AML patients, we performed an analysis of all patients with FLT3 mutations registered in the Czech Acute Leukemia Clinical Register (ALERT) from 2003 till the end of 2005. Within the mentioned period 170 patients with AML of median age 56 years (23-77) were investigated for FLT3 mutation, within them 36 cases (21%) with FLT3 mutations (32 FLT3 ITD and 4 FLT3 D835) were found. Out of FLT3 ITD positive patients 13 had allogeneic transplantation, 20 patients with mutations of FLT3 were treated with chemotherapy without transplantation. Results of the treatment of these patients were compared with the results of the group of patients without FLT3 mutation, which was according to other characteristics identical with the group of patients with FLT3 mutations (n=134). Median overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter for patients with FLT3 ITD (34.8 weeks) than for those without FLT3 mutations (67.7 weeks; P=0.028). Median OS of patients with FLT3 ITD who had allogeneic transplantation was 42.5 weeks; median OS of patients with FLT3 ITD treated only with chemotherapy was 29.6 weeks (P=0.362). After allogeneic transplantation, median OS of FLT3 mutations negative patients was similar to FLT3 ITD positive patients (46.7 versus 42.5 weeks; P=0.443). Our results suggest that at present there is no strong evidence that FLT3 status alone should influence the decision to proceed to allogeneic transplantation in AML patients. Decision to proceed to alogeneic transplantation should not be based on the FLT3 status only, but it should also consider other prognostic factors.","['Doubek, M', 'Muzik, J', 'Szotkowski, T', 'Koza, V', 'Cetkovsky, P', 'Kozak, T', 'Zak, P', 'Voglova, J', 'Struncova, S', 'Dusek, L', 'Indrak, K']","['Doubek M', 'Muzik J', 'Szotkowski T', 'Koza V', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Kozak T', 'Zak P', 'Voglova J', 'Struncova S', 'Dusek L', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematooncology, Masaryk University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic. mdoubek@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Czech Republic', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2007/01/20 09:00,2007/06/28 09:00,['2007/01/20 09:00'],"['2007/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(1):89-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG is currently tested in clinical trials and known to inhibit the function of Hsp90 and promote the proteasomal degradation of its misfolded client proteins. ATL is a fatal malignancy of T lymphocytes caused by HTLV-I infection and remains incurable. Since Hsp90 is overexpressed in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells, we analyzed the effects of 17-AAG on cell survival, apoptosis and expression of signal transduction proteins. HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells were significantly more sensitive to 17-AAG in cell survival assays than normal PBMCs. 17-AAG induced the inhibition of cell cycle and apoptosis. These effects could be mediated by inactivation of NF-kappaB, AP-1 and PI3K/Akt pathways, as well as reduction of expression of proteins involved in the G1-S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition interfered with 17-AAG-mediated signaling proteins depletion.

In this study, we determined the DNA methylation status of 13 cancer-related genes in the context of JAK2 mutations in 39 patients with MPD. Genes analyzed for hypermethylation were SOCS-1, SHP-1, E-cadherin, MGMT, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, p15, p16, p73, DAPK1, RASSF1A, RARbeta2 and hMLH1. We found at least one hypermethylated gene in 15/39 MPD patient specimens, and in 6/39 samples aberrant methylation of the negative cytokine regulator SOCS-1 was present. The JAK2V617F mutation was found in 21/39 patients as determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Hypermethylation of SOCS-1 was observed in 3/21 patients with an autoactivating JAK2 mutation and in 3/18 patients with wild-type JAK2. Our results suggest that epigenetic inactivation of SOCS-1 may be a complementary mechanism to the JAK2V617F mutation in the pathogenesis of MPD that leads to dysregulation of JAK-STAT signal transduction and thus contributes to growth factor hypersensitivity.","['Jost, E', 'do O, N', 'Dahl, E', 'Maintz, C E', 'Jousten, P', 'Habets, L', 'Wilop, S', 'Herman, J G', 'Osieka, R', 'Galm, O']","['Jost E', 'do O N', 'Dahl E', 'Maintz CE', 'Jousten P', 'Habets L', 'Wilop S', 'Herman JG', 'Osieka R', 'Galm O']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/physiology']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404513 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404513 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):505-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404513.

Indeed, as in acute leukemias and non-hodgkins lymphoma, we believe it is no longer acceptable to consider MM a single disease entity. As such, the accurate diagnosis of MM subtypes and the adoption of common criteria for the identification and stratification of MM patients has become critical. Herein, we provide a consensus high-risk definition and offer practical guidelines for the adoption of routine diagnostic testing. Although acknowledging that more refined classifications will continue to be developed, we propose that the definition of high-risk disease (any of the t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), deletion 17q13, aneuploidy or deletion chromosome 13 by metaphase cytogenetics, or plasma cell labeling index >3.0) be adopted. This classification will identify most of the 25% of MM patients for whom current therapies are inadequate and for whom investigational regimens should be vigorously pursued. Conversely, the 75% of patients remaining have more favorable outcomes using existing - albeit non-curative - therapeutic options.","['Stewart, A K', 'Bergsagel, P L', 'Greipp, P R', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Gertz, M A', 'Hayman, S R', 'Kumar, S', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Lust, J A', 'Russell, S J', 'Witzig, T E', 'Zeldenrust, S R', 'Dingli, D', 'Reeder, C B', 'Roy, V', 'Kyle, R A', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Fonseca, R']","['Stewart AK', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Greipp PR', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Gertz MA', 'Hayman SR', 'Kumar S', 'Lacy MQ', 'Lust JA', 'Russell SJ', 'Witzig TE', 'Zeldenrust SR', 'Dingli D', 'Reeder CB', 'Roy V', 'Kyle RA', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Fonseca R']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA. stewart.keith@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Counseling', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*classification/genetics/therapy', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404516 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404516 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):529-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404516.

In this study, 8q24 breakpoints from 17 B-cell lymphomas involving non-IG loci were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In seven cases the breakpoint was inside a small region encompassing MYC: in one t(7;8)(p12;q24) and two t(3;8)(q27;q24), it was telomeric to MYC whereas in four cases, one t(2;8)(p15;q24) and three t(8;9)(q24;p13) it was located in a 85 kb region encompassing MYC. In these seven cases, partner regions identified by FISH contained genes known to be involved in lymphomagenesis, namely BCL6, BCL11A, PAX5 and IKAROS. Breakpoints were cloned in two t(8;9)(q24;p13), 2.5 and 7 kb downstream from MYC and several hundred kb 5' to PAX5 on chromosome 9, joining MYC to ZCCHC7 and to ZBTB5 exon 2, two genes encoding zinc-finger proteins. In these seven cases, MYC expression measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was significantly higher when compared to that of patients without 8q24 rearrangement (P=0.006). These results suggest that these rearrangements are the consequence of a non-random process targeting MYC together with non-IG genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation and lymphoma progression.","['Bertrand, P', 'Bastard, C', 'Maingonnat, C', 'Jardin, F', 'Maisonneuve, C', 'Courel, M-N', 'Ruminy, P', 'Picquenot, J-M', 'Tilly, H']","['Bertrand P', 'Bastard C', 'Maingonnat C', 'Jardin F', 'Maisonneuve C', 'Courel MN', 'Ruminy P', 'Picquenot JM', 'Tilly H']","[""Groupe d'Etude des Proliferations Lymphoides, Centre Henri Becquerel, INSERM U614, IFRMP23, Rouen, France. pbertrand@rouen.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404529 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404529 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):515-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404529.

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of FLT3 (FLT3/ITD) is the most frequent mutation in human adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3/ITD contributes to the constitutive activation of FLT3 itself and its downstream signal components, mitogen-activated protein kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5), and enables interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell lines to grow autonomously. In the present study, we showed the specific association of FLT3/ITD with Lyn, which led to the phosphorylation of Lyn in vivo. We also demonstrated that FLT3/ITD receptors displayed a higher affinity to bind to Lyn than wild-type FLT3 receptors in vitro and that this affinity was relative to the intensity of tyrosil phosphorylation of the receptor. Both treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Lyn and the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 suppressed the IL-3-independent growth of FLT3/ITD-expressing 32D cells (FLT3/ITD-32D), reducing the constitutive phosphorylation of Lyn and STAT5. PP2 treatment of mice transplanted with FLT3/ITD-32D cells blocked the onset of tumors and decreased the size of established tumors. These results demonstrate that Lyn is an important component of the signal transduction pathway specific to FLT3/ITD and can be a therapeutic target in the treatment of AML with FLT3/ITD.","['Okamoto, M', 'Hayakawa, F', 'Miyata, Y', 'Watamoto, K', 'Emi, N', 'Abe, A', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Towatari, M', 'Naoe, T']","['Okamoto M', 'Hayakawa F', 'Miyata Y', 'Watamoto K', 'Emi N', 'Abe A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Towatari M', 'Naoe T']","['1Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AG 1879)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line/drug effects/transplantation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404547 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404547 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):403-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404547.

Although racial differences in frequency of different types of childhood ALL have been reported, many are confounded by selected or limited population samples. The Malaysia-Singapore (MA-SPORE) Leukemia Study Group provided a unique platform for the study of the frequency of major subgroups of childhood ALL in a large cohort of unselected multiethnic Asian children. Screening for the prognostically important chromosome abnormalities (TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, and MLL) using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on 299 consecutive patients with ALL at 3 study centers (236 de novo, 63 at relapse), with the ethnic composition predominantly Chinese (51.8%) and Malay (34.8%). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was successful in 278 (93%) of cases screened. The commonest fusion transcript was TEL-AML1 (19.1%) followed by BCR-ABL (7.8%), MLL rearrangements (4.2%), and E2A-PBX1 (3.1%). Chinese have a significantly lower frequency of TEL-AML1 (13.3% in de novo patients) compared with Malays (22.2%) and Indians (21.7%) (P=0.04). Malays have a lower frequency of T-ALL (6.2%) compared with the Chinese and Indians (9.8%). Both Malays (7.4%) and Chinese (5.0%) have significantly higher frequency of BCR-ABL compared with the Indian population (P<0.05) despite a similar median age at presentation.

Dysregulation of apoptosis plays an important role in the development of a variety of human pathologies, including cancer, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Particularly, studies carried out in the last years have shown that leukemia cells invariably have abnormalities in one or more apoptotic pathways, determining a survival advantage of these cells over their normal counterpart. Furthermore, abnormalities in the apoptotic response also play a role in the development of drug resistance by leukemic cells. The identification of the different components of the apoptotic pathways has enabled the detection of various biochemical defects present in leukemic cells compared to their normal counterpart. These defects contribute to the survival advantage of the leukemic clone over the normal hematopoietic cells and are also frequently associated with a low rate of response to standard chemotherapy treatment and with poor survival. Furthermore, these findings have also lead to the identification of many potential apoptotic targets for the development of new drugs targeting anti-apoptotic molecules abnormally expressed or regulated in leukemic cells. Many of these drugs restore the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptotic stimuli and some of them are under investigation at a clinical level.","['Testa, Ugo', 'Riccioni, Roberta']","['Testa U', 'Riccioni R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. u.testa@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.10279 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jan;92(1):81-94. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10279.,,,,,,,122,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study phase I/II study was to assess the feasibility of large-scale in vitro generation of leukemia-reactive CTL for clinical use. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a modified limiting dilution culture system donor T cells were stimulated with HLA-identical leukemic antigen presenting cells. Feasibility experiments demonstrated that in 16 of 27 donor-recipient pairs tested a CTL line could be generated. Twelve of these 16 patients developed a relapse and for 11 of these 12 patients a CTL line was generated under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. RESULTS: The CTL lines showed moderate to high cytotoxic activity against original recipient leukemic cells in vitro. Eight patients with a relapse received from one to seven CTL lines. One patient entered a complete remission after CTL infusion only, one entered a complete remission after combined CTL infusion and donor lymphocyte infusion, two patients had temporarily stable disease, and in four patients no response was observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although the current procedure to generate these CTL lines is feasible, the strategy is logistically complex and time-consuming, and needs further improvement.

Sorafenib (BAY43-9006, Nexavar) is a small molecule B-RAF inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) families. We investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRbeta, KIT, and FLT3, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by ETV6-PDGFRbeta, FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication or D835Y point mutation, and the KIT(D816V) mutant. The direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies. RESULTS: We show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of ETV6-PDGFRbeta and FLT3 mutants, including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other FLT3 inhibitors. Sorafenib induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13, both expressing FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The imatinib-resistant KIT(D816V) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to sorafenib. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of PDGFRbeta and FLT3.","['Lierman, Els', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Van Miegroet, Helen', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Cools, Jan']","['Lierman E', 'Lahortiga I', 'Van Miegroet H', 'Mentens N', 'Marynen P', 'Cools J']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sorafenib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*biosynthesis/*genetics']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.10692 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jan;92(1):27-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10692.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous mortality studies of over 17,000 male synthetic rubber workers found an excess of leukemia that may be due to BD or BD plus other chemicals. Experimental studies have shown that BD produces mammary tumors in female mice and rats and ovarian tumors in female mice. AIM: This paper presents the methods of a follow-up study that evaluates the mortality experience of women employed in the North American synthetic rubber industry. METHODS: Women employed for at least 1 day at any of eight North American styrene-butadiene rubber plants were followed up from 1943 to 2002. Identifying and work history information were obtained from personnel records. Estimated quantitative exposure to BD, styrene and DMDTC, developed for our previous study of men, were used in this study. External analyses use the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare the cohort's cause-specific mortality rates to the rates of the female general population of the states or the province where the plants are located. Internal analyses use the Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models to examine specific cancer mortality rates in relation to BD, styrene and DMDTC exposure, by comparing an exposed cohort subgroup with the rate of unexposed cohort members.","['Sathiakumar, Nalini', 'Delzell, Elizabeth']","['Sathiakumar N', 'Delzell E']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA. nalini@uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,['9006-04-6 (Rubber)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Rats', 'Rubber/adverse effects/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Vital Statistics']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(06)00337-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2006.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2007 Mar 20;166(1-3):25-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.11.005.

Although the use of arsenic to treat hematologic cancers has been documented since the 19th century, widespread use of arsenic compounds in patients with hematologic malignancies did not occur until the 1990s, when several groups in China reported impressive clinical response rates in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who had received arsenic trioxide. Subsequently, clinical studies conducted in the United States confirmed earlier reports, and arsenic trioxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. The use of arsenic compounds in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) is supported by the proposed mechanisms of action underlying the antitumor activity of arsenic and by preclinical studies showing antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities in cell culture and animal models. Moreover, clinical studies of arsenic compounds, particularly arsenic trioxide-based regimens, have shown that this drug is clinically active in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Combination studies with other antimyeloma agents have shown evidence of synergy with arsenic trioxide. Furthermore, arsenic trioxide-based regimens in MM appear to be well tolerated, particularly with regard to cardiac toxicity. The activity and tolerability observed in clinical studies promise to make arsenic-based chemotherapy a viable treatment option for patients whose disease does not respond to or who cannot tolerate other chemotherapy regimens.","['Berenson, James R', 'Yeh, Howard S']","['Berenson JR', 'Yeh HS']","['Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA. jberenson@imbcr.org']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'History, 18th Century', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/*history', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use']",2007/01/19 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1557-9190(11)70325-0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2006.n.058 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2006 Nov;7(3):192-8. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2006.n.058.,,,,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesis utilizes a regioselective C-acylation of a dilithium dianion derived from a substituted o-hydroxyactophenone to afford a beta-diketone intermediate that can be cyclized to zapotin in good overall yield, thus avoiding the inefficient Baker-Venkataraman rearrangement pathway. Zapotin was found to induce both cell differentiation and apoptosis with cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells). In addition, the compound inhibits 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity with human bladder carcinoma cells (T24 cells), and TPA-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity with human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells).

In recent studies, it was determined that the extracts of this plant are effective to treat some types of cancer, but these studies are limited and do not include human leukemia. In the present study, firstly we aimed to investigate in vitro the cytotoxic effects of No on the HL60 and K562 leukemia cell lines. The cells were incubated with six different concentrations of each three extracts. MTT assay was employed as a cytotoxicity test. It was observed that concentrations of 1000, 500 and 50 microg/ml from each extract possess marked antileukemic effects. No leaf and root extracts were seen to be more cytotoxic than the stem extract according to LC50. Secondly, in order to understand the role of P-gp in cytotoxicity, P-gp levels of K562 resistant and sensitive cells were measured by flow cytometry before treatment extracts, and then, the cells were incubated with No leaf, stem and root extracts in 500 microg/ml concentrations overnight. After incubation, measurements showed decreased levels of P-gp in the cells.

The Bcl-2 pathway is deregulated in these tumors and may represent an interesting target for new therapeutic strategies. The new small-molecule pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor GX15-070 mimics BH3-only proteins by binding to multiple antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members. Here we show that GX15-070 induced apoptosis in vitro in MCL cell lines and primary cells from patients with MCL by releasing Bak from Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) at short incubation times and low micromolar doses. GX15-070 was effective in cells bearing defective DNA damage-sensor genes or cell-cycle regulators, inducing Bax and Bak conformational changes, mitochondrial depolarization, phosphatidylserine exposure, and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, GX15-070 synergized with bortezomib, sensitizing MCL cells to low doses of this proteasome inhibitor, by neutralizing bortezomib-induced Mcl-1 accumulation and cooperating with Noxa to induce Bak displacement from this protein. These events led to an increased activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Importantly, GX15-070 alone or in combination with bortezomib showed no significant cytotoxic effect in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. All these findings suggest that GX15-070 alone or in combination with bortezomib represents a new attractive therapeutic approach for MCL treatment.","['Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Roue, Gael', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Perez-Galan P', 'Roue G', 'Villamor N', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41570-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-034173 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4441-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-034173.

The mice that received Hoxa9/Meis1-transduced bone marrow cells developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and Trib1, Evi1, Ahi1, Raralpha, Pitpnb, and AK039950 were identified as candidate cooperative genes located near common retroviral integration sites. Trib1 and Evi1 were up-regulated due to retroviral insertions, and coexpression of these genes significantly accelerated the onset of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML, suggesting that Trib1 and Evi1 are the key collaborators. Furthermore, Trib1 by itself is a novel myeloid oncogene, enhancing phosphorylation of ERK, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis.

While recent in vitro data demonstrated a quantitative relationship between CD33 expression and GO cytotoxicity, previous correlative studies failed to identify a significant association between CD33 expression and clinical outcome. Studying patients undergoing GO monotherapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we now find that AML blasts of responders have a significantly higher mean CD33 level and lower P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity compared with nonresponders. CD33 expression and Pgp activity are inversely correlated. While both variables are associated with outcome, Pgp remains significantly associated with outcome even after adjusting for CD33, whereas CD33 does not show such an association after adjusting for Pgp.

We demonstrate here that established mixed chimerism influences the potency of DLI-mediated alloreactivity only in the MHC-mismatched but not MHC-matched setting. In the MHC-matched setting, high levels (>or= 40%) of residual host chimerism correlated negatively with DLI-mediated alloreactivity irrespective of the timing of their administration, the donor's previous sensitization to host antigens, or the level of residual host APCs. In vivo administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands was required to maximize DLI-mediated LH-GVH and GVL reactivities in chimeras with low levels (<or= 15%) of residual host chimerism. In contrast, coadministration of DLI with antigen-presenting cell (APC) activators was insufficient to augment their LH-GVH response in the presence of high levels of host chimerism unless the host's T cells were transiently depleted. Together, these results show the cardinal influence of donor-host incompatibility on DLI-mediated GVH responses and suggest that in MHC-matched chimeras, the induction of optimal alloreactivity requires not only donor T cells and host APCs but also TLR ligands and in the presence of high levels of host chimerism depletion of host T cells.","['Durakovic, Nadira', 'Radojcic, Vedran', 'Skarica, Mario', 'Bezak, Karl B', 'Powell, Jonathan D', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Luznik, Leo']","['Durakovic N', 'Radojcic V', 'Skarica M', 'Bezak KB', 'Powell JD', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Luznik L']","['Divisions of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41584-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-048124 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4564-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-048124.

Elucidating the role of vaccination in the aetiology of childhood acute leukaemia (AL) was therefore included in the objectives of an ongoing national study. METHODS: The ESCALE study was a French national population-based case-control study conducted in France in 2003 and 2004 in order to investigate the role of infectious, environmental and genetic factors in four childhood neoplastic diseases (leukaemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and brain tumour). The controls were randomly selected from the French population and age and gender frequency matched with the cases. A total of 776 cases of AL (91% of the eligible cases) and 1681 controls (71% of the eligible controls) were included. In a specific standardized telephone interview, which was the same for both the cases and controls, each mother was asked to read out her child's complete vaccination record. RESULTS: No association between vaccination and the risk of childhood AL: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloblastic leukaemia was observed. No relationship between the risk of leukaemia and the type of vaccine, number of doses of each vaccine, total number of injections, total number of vaccine doses or number of early vaccinations was evidenced. No confounding factor was observed. CONCLUSION: The study did not show any evidence of a role of vaccination in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia.","['Mallol-Mesnard, Nathalie', 'Menegaux, Florence', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Robert, Alain', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Margueritte, Genevieve', 'Perel, Yves', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Mallol-Mesnard N', 'Menegaux F', 'Auvrignon A', 'Auclerc MF', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Robert A', 'Michel G', 'Margueritte G', 'Perel Y', 'Mechinaud F', 'Bordigoni P', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM U754, IFR69, 16 avenue Paul Vaillant-Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,['0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*immunology/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology/virology', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Sex Distribution', 'Vaccination/adverse effects']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyl270 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyl270 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2007 Feb;36(1):110-6. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyl270.

The cytotoxic activity of these endoperoxides toward rapidly dividing human carcinoma cells and cell lines has been reported, and it is hypothesized that activation of the endoperoxide bridge by an iron(II) species, to form C-centered radicals, is essential for cytotoxicity. The studies described here have utilized artemisinin derivatives, dihydroartemisinin, 10beta-(p-bromophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, and 10beta-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, to determine the chemistry of endoperoxide bridge activation to reactive intermediates responsible for initiating cell death and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of cell death. These studies have demonstrated the selective cytotoxic activity of the endoperoxides toward leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and Jurkat) over quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Deoxy-10beta-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, which lacks the endoperoxide bridge, was 50- and 130-fold less active in HL-60 and Jurkat cells, respectively, confirming the importance of this functional group for cytotoxicity. We have shown that chemical activation is responsible for cytotoxicity by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to monitor endoperoxide activation by measurement of a stable rearrangement product of endoperoxide-derived radicals, which was formed in sensitive HL-60 cells but not in insensitive peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In HL-60 cells the endoperoxides induce caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death characterized by concentration- and time-dependent mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of caspases-3 and -7, sub-G(0)/G(1) DNA formation, and attenuation by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a caspase inhibitor. Overall, these results indicate that endoperoxide-induced cell death is a consequence of activation of the endoperoxide bridge to radical species, which triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis.","['Mercer, Amy E', 'Maggs, James L', 'Sun, Xiao-Ming', 'Cohen, Gerald M', 'Chadwick, James', ""O'Neill, Paul M"", 'Park, B Kevin']","['Mercer AE', 'Maggs JL', 'Sun XM', 'Cohen GM', 'Chadwick J', ""O'Neill PM"", 'Park BK']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE.', 'Department of Chemistry, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE.

Altered expression and/or mutations in PTKs are linked to many forms of cancer, yet until recently little was known about the roles of PTPs in normal cells or in cancer. Earlier work established that a member of the PTP superfamily, PTEN, is an important tumor suppressor gene. We now know that at least one other PTP, the SH2 domain-containing phosphatase Shp2, is a bona fide oncogene that is mutated in several types of leukemia and hyperactivated by other mechanisms in some solid tumors. Understanding how Shp2 and other PTPs contribute to oncogenesis should provide new insights into pathogenesis and might suggest new targets for anti-neoplastic drugs.","['Mohi, M Golam', 'Neel, Benjamin G']","['Mohi MG', 'Neel BG']","['Department of Pharmacology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, WHA #3319, 750 East Adams Street, Syracuse, NY 13020, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Genet Dev,Current opinion in genetics & development,9111375,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/03/10 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-437X(06)00246-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gde.2006.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Genet Dev. 2007 Feb;17(1):23-30. doi: 10.1016/j.gde.2006.12.011.

Leukaemia and neurological manifestations are associated with HTLV-I/II infections, and treatment is usually based on anti-inflammatory drugs including glucocorticoids. Although steroid resistance has been reported, it is unknown whether this condition is related to the infection itself or to the treatment. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether spontaneous cell proliferation is associated with T-cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight HTLV-I/II patients and 11 healthy age-matched controls took part in this study. Lymphocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro to measure spontaneous and mitogen-induced proliferation as well as cellular sensitivity to dexamethasone. RESULTS: Patients with HTLV-I/II infection showed similar stimulated and unstimulated T-cell proliferation as well as comparable sensitivity to dexamethasone in vitro. There were no group differences in the frequency of glucocorticoid responders versus non-responders. However, T cells of patients with spontaneous proliferation were unresponsive to mitogenic stimulation and were remarkably more resistant to dexamethasone than cells of patients with normal proliferation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the poor clinical response to steroids may be associated with spontaneous cell proliferation during HTLV infection.","['Lopes, R P', 'Menna-Barreto, M', 'Bauer, M E']","['Lopes RP', 'Menna-Barreto M', 'Bauer ME']","['Instituto de Pesquisas Biomedicas, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*blood', 'HTLV-II Infections/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology/virology']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR419 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00419.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2007 Feb;40(1):64-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00419.x.,,PMC6495856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has become important to include ZAP-70 in the immunophenotyping panel used to diagnose CLL, commonly performed by flow cytometry (FC). Nevertheless, the methodology used to detect ZAP-70 by FC has not been extensively evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To describe our FC method for detecting ZAP-70 in CLL and assess whether this assay is useful in estimating the ZAP-70 protein level in CLL cells. DESIGN: ZAP-70 expression was assessed by FC in 45 consecutive newly diagnosed CLL patients, and the results were correlated with those of immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: With >25% ZAP-70-positive B cells as the cutoff, the FC results had a perfect concordance with those of immunocytochemistry (39/39, 100%) and Western blot analysis (7/7, 100%). The use of autofluorescence controls was found to be superior to other alternatives. Overall, 19 (42%) of 45 cases were ZAP-70 positive in our series. Since only 7 cases (16%) had >20% to 30% ZAP-70-positive B cells, the cutoff of >25% readily separated CLL into positive and negative groups in most cases. ZAP-70 positivity was significantly associated with atypical morphology but not other laboratory parameters evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: With proper specimen processing and the use of directly fluorescence-conjugated anti-ZAP-70 antibody, one can readily incorporate ZAP-70 into the routine FC study panel for CLL. Our data suggest that FC is a rapid and useful method to estimate the ZAP-70 protein expression level in CLL.","['Slack, Graham W', 'Wizniak, Juanita', 'Dabbagh, Laith', 'Shi, Xinzhe', 'Gelebart, Pascal', 'Lai, Raymond']","['Slack GW', 'Wizniak J', 'Dabbagh L', 'Shi X', 'Gelebart P', 'Lai R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Blotting, Western/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Specimen Handling', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/immunology/*metabolism']",2007/01/18 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2007/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['OA5-1160 [pii]', '10.5858/2007-131-50-FCDOZI [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007 Jan;131(1):50-6. doi: 10.5858/2007-131-50-FCDOZI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be highly desirable to develop a personalized therapeutic strategy for selection of appropriate drugs or regimens based on the drug sensitivity profiles of leukemic cells from individuals. METHODS: We applied a multiparameter flow cytometric drug cytotoxicity assay to evaluate drug effects specifically on B-CLL cells from 43 individuals after leukemic cells were incubated in vitro with fludarabine, chlorambucil, cladribine, or prednisolone. RESULTS: We demonstrated that different B-CLL cell populations from 43 individuals showed a marked variability in drug sensitivity. In vitro resistance to fludarabine was greatest in B-CLL cells with deletions of p53, a cytogenetic abnormality that is almost invariably associated with a poor therapeutic response clinically.

A model system was therefore developed using synthetic glycoconjugates as tools to modify the carbohydrate pattern on NK target cell surfaces. NK cells were then assessed for function in response to synthetic glycoconjugates, using both cytolysis-associated caspase 6 activation measured by flow cytometry and IFN-gamma production. Lipophilic neoglycoconjugates were synthesized to provide their easy incorporation into the target cell membranes and to make carbohydrate residues available for cell-cell interactions. While incorporation was successful based on fluorescence monitoring, glycoconjugate incorporation did not evoke artifactual changes in surface antigen expression, and had no negative effect on cell viability. Glycoconjugates contained Le(x), sulfated Le(x), and Le(y) sharing the common structure motif trisaccharide Le(x) were revealed to enhance cytotoxicity mediated specifically by CD16 +CD56+NK cells. The glycoconjugate effects were dependent on saccharide presentation in a polymeric form. Only polymeric, or clustered, but not monomeric glycoconjugates resulted in alteration of cytotoxicity in our system, suggesting that appropriate presentation is critical for carbohydrate recognition and subsequent biological effects.","['Kovalenko, Elena I', 'Abakushina, Elena', 'Telford, William', 'Kapoor, Veena', 'Korchagina, Elena', 'Khaidukov, Sergei', 'Molotkovskaya, Irina', 'Sapozhnikov, Alexander', 'Vlaskin, Pavel', 'Bovin, Nicolai']","['Kovalenko EI', 'Abakushina E', 'Telford W', 'Kapoor V', 'Korchagina E', 'Khaidukov S', 'Molotkovskaya I', 'Sapozhnikov A', 'Vlaskin P', 'Bovin N']","['Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, ul.

Dysregulated hematopoiesis occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), being caused at least in part by abnormalities in the hematopoietic progenitors. However, the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in CML has not been well characterized. The objectives of the present study were to observe the biological characteristics of MSCs from CML patients and to determine if MSCs originate in part from donors in CML patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We analyzed MSCs from 5 untreated patients and from 3 CML patients after sex-mismatched allogeneic BMT. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the typical MSC phenotype and in vitro assays showed ability to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Moreover, although some RT-PCR data were contradictory, combined fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that MSCs from CML patients do not express the bcr-abl gene. Regarding MSCs of donor origin, although it is possible to detect Y target sequence by nested PCR, the low frequency (0.14 and 0.34%) of XY cells in 2 MSC CML patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis suggests the presence of contaminant hematopoietic cells and the absence of host-derived MSCs in CML patients. Therefore, we conclude that MSCs from CML patients express the typical MSC phenotype, can differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages and do not express the bcr-abl gene. MSCs cannot be found in recipients 12 to 20 months after BMT. The influence of MSCs on the dysregulation of hematopoiesis in CML patients deserves further investigation.","['Carrara, R C V', 'Orellana, M D', 'Fontes, A M', 'Palma, P V B', 'Kashima, S', 'Mendes, M R', 'Coutinho, M A', 'Voltarelli, J C', 'Covas, D T']","['Carrara RC', 'Orellana MD', 'Fontes AM', 'Palma PV', 'Kashima S', 'Mendes MR', 'Coutinho MA', 'Voltarelli JC', 'Covas DT']","['Centro Regional de Hemoterapia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*chemistry/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2007/01/17 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/01/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2007000100008 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2007000100008 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2007 Jan;40(1):57-67. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2007000100008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article will give an update on the genetic basis of variable therapeutic responses to anticancer agents in children. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of recent findings concern the pharmacogenetics of key components of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate. This is not surprising given that leukemia is the most common cancer affecting children, accounting for 25-35% of childhood malignancies worldwide with acute lymphoblastic leukemia comprising 80% of leukemia cases. In certain patients treatment fails due to drug resistance, rendering acute lymphoblastic leukemia the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Most of the studies use a candidate gene approach adding a new body of evidence to existing knowledge. Recent findings relating to other childhood tumors and the potential to optimize treatment of these malignancies are briefly discussed. SUMMARY: Interindividual differences in drug responses are an important cause of resistance to treatment and adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetics tends to identify the genetic basis of these suboptimal responses allowing traditional treatment to be complemented by genotype-based drug dose adjustment.","['Ansari, Marc', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Ansari M', 'Krajinovic M']","['Research Center Charles Bruneau, CHU Sainte-Justine, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2007/01/17 09:00,2007/06/20 09:00,['2007/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0b013e3280140613 [doi]', '00008480-200702000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Feb;19(1):15-22. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3280140613.,,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies within the past year, described within this review, have provided tremendous insights into the role of GATA1 mutations in these malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past year, our understanding of the molecular and cellular consequences of GATA1 mutations has been greatly enhanced. Most importantly, we have learned that these mutations, which result in the exclusive production of the short GATA1 isoform named GATA1s, have a distinct effect on fetal liver progenitors. In addition, multiple studies have shown that GATA1s can substitute for GATA1 in many aspects of megakaryocytic maturation. Finally, an important clinical study has revealed that GATA1 mutations alone are insufficient for leukemia. SUMMARY: Leukemia in children with Down syndrome requires at least three cooperating events--trisomy 21, a GATA1 mutation, and a third, as yet undefined, genetic alteration. Recent studies have provided tremendous insights into the GATA1 side of the story. Future experiments with human patient samples and mouse models will likely increase our awareness of the role of trisomy 21 in transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryocytic leukemia.","['Vyas, Paresh', 'Crispino, John D']","['Vyas P', 'Crispino JD']","['Department of Haematology, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype']",2007/01/17 09:00,2007/06/20 09:00,['2007/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0b013e328013e7b2 [doi]', '00008480-200702000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Feb;19(1):9-14. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e328013e7b2.,"['R01 CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101774-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,

The rarity of these disorders in children and the lack of a widely accepted classification have contributed to the paucity of reports on these malignancies in the pediatric literature. A number of significant advances have been achieved in recent years. The present review will focus on diagnostics and therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: International consensus has been achieved on classifying these disorders into three main groups; myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome (ML-DS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). In the last few years we have witnessed important advances, especially regarding the therapy of these disorders, and we have gained insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ML-DS and JMML. SUMMARY: Classification of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders has been facilitated.

Its importance during development has been clearly demonstrated by knocking out key genes in mouse. APAF1 is the core protein of the apoptosome and its dosage is also critical in various cancer types, i.e., melanoma, germ line tumor, gastrointestinal cancer and B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is generally due to inactivation of the APAF1 locus by epigenetic phenomena or by activity of promoter regulators. We investigated the putative roles of the apoptosome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We found that both APAF1 mRNA and protein are dysregulated in human PDAC samples. Similarly, several PDAC cell lines exhibited variable levels of both APAF1 protein and mRNA. The response to cell death induction and its biochemical features were assessed by treatment of each line with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. We found that the apoptosome pathway was not functional in most cell lines upon cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In addition, we restored APAF1 and Caspase-9 dosage in Panc-1 cells, where the apoptosome is downregulated, by overexpressing the murine cDNA of the two molecules, and we improved the death response to chemotherapeutic agents.","['Corvaro, Marco', 'Fuoco, Claudia', 'Wagner, Martin', 'Cecconi, Francesco']","['Corvaro M', 'Fuoco C', 'Wagner M', 'Cecconi F']","['Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Department of Biology, University of Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome 00133, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism']",2007/01/17 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['3622 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.6.2.3622 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Feb;6(2):209-17. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.2.3622.

Evidence for similarities in store-operated and calcium release-activated calcium channel components.,9105-16,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a ubiquitous mechanism that is mediated by distinct SOC channels, ranging from the highly selective calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel in rat basophilic leukemia and other hematopoietic cells to relatively Ca2+-selective or non-selective SOC channels in other cells. Although the exact composition of these channels is not yet established, TRPC1 contributes to SOC channels and regulation of physiological function of a variety of cell types. Recently, Orai1 and STIM1 have been suggested to be sufficient for generating CRAC channels. Here we show that Orai1 and STIM1 are also required for TRPC1-SOC channels. Knockdown of TRPC1, Orai1, or STIM1 attenuated, whereas overexpression of TRPC1, but not Orai1 or STIM1, induced an increase in SOC entry and I(SOC) in human salivary gland cells. All three proteins were co-localized in the plasma membrane region of cells, and thapsigargin increased co-immunoprecipitation of TRPC1 with STIM1, and Orai1 in human salivary gland cells as well as dispersed mouse submandibular gland cells. In aggregate, the data presented here reveal that all three proteins are essential for generation of I(SOC) in these cells and that dynamic assembly of TRPC1-STIM1-Orai1 ternary complex is involved in activation of SOC channel in response to internal Ca2+ store depletion. Thus, these data suggest a common molecular basis for SOC and CRAC channels.","['Ong, Hwei Ling', 'Cheng, Kwong Tai', 'Liu, Xibao', 'Bandyopadhyay, Bidhan C', 'Paria, Biman C', 'Soboloff, Jonathan', 'Pani, Biswaranjan', 'Gwack, Yousang', 'Srikanth, Sonal', 'Singh, Brij B', 'Gill, Donald L', 'Ambudkar, Indu S']","['Ong HL', 'Cheng KT', 'Liu X', 'Bandyopadhyay BC', 'Paria BC', 'Soboloff J', 'Pani B', 'Gwack Y', 'Srikanth S', 'Singh BB', 'Gill DL', 'Ambudkar IS']","['Secretory Physiology Section, Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '0 (ORAI1 protein, human)', '0 (STIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Stim1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry', 'ORAI1 Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Salivary Glands/metabolism', 'Stromal Interaction Molecule 1', 'Submandibular Gland/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/chemistry/pharmacology']",2007/01/17 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)83496-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M608942200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Mar 23;282(12):9105-16. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M608942200.

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 25 cattle with enlarged peripheral lymph nodes. PROCEDURES: Antemortem biopsies of the selected lymph nodes were performed with an 18-gauge, 12-cm core needle biopsy instrument. Fine-needle aspirates were performed with a 20-gauge, 4-cm needle. Specimens were analyzed by pathologists who were unaware of clinical findings and final necropsy findings, and specimens were categorized as reactive, neoplastic, or nondiagnostic for comparison with necropsy results. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of core needle biopsy ranged from 38% to 67% and from 80% to 25%, respectively. Sensitivity of fine-needle aspiration ranged from 41% to 53%, and specificity was 100%. Predictive values for positive test results ranged from 77% to 89% for core needle biopsy and were 100% for fine-needle aspiration. Predictive values for negative test results were low for both core needle biopsy and fine-needle aspiration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that core needle biopsy and fine-needle aspiration can aid in the antemortem diagnosis of bovine enzootic lymphosarcoma.

The general opinion in favor of icosahedral symmetry based on electron microscopy observations was questioned when cryo-electron microscopy failed to provide convincing evidence in its favor. More recent studies by cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and in vitro assembly of the CA domain of Human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) threw new light on the organization of retroviral cores. In this communication we report how we produced a three-dimensional (3D) model of MuLV core using data from CA assembly on a lipid film [Ganser, B.K., Cheng, A., Sundquist, W.I., Yeager, M., 2003. Three-dimensional structure of the M-MuLV CA protein on a lipid monolayer: a general model for retroviral capsid assembly. EMBO J. 22, 2886-2892]. The resulting structure revealed that the molecular organization of the core shell is specific and the presence of a 5,3,2 rotational symmetry of the 3D model provides support for icosahedral shape of MuLV cores. The model made it possible to determine the diameter of the cores and calculate the number of CA copies as well as the molecular mass of a core of specific diameter. Thus MuLV cores 68 (or 81.6) nm in diameter consist of 1500 (or 2160) copies of CA. About 12% of molecules from fullerene-like Gag shells versus 71% of molecules of closely packed (core-like). Gag shells were not incorporated into the core shells (capsids). Our 3D models received support from X-ray data of MuLV CA NTD domain published by Mortuza et al.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and toxic effects of vincristine-dexamethasone pulses as an addition to the continuation-therapy phase in a large cohort of children with intermediate-risk disease who were treated with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) treatment strategy. METHODS: 3109 children, diagnosed with ALL and intermediate-risk features, were enrolled by eight participating organisations in eleven countries. All were treated with very similar protocols based on the BFM treatment strategy, which included induction, consolidation, reinduction, and continuation-therapy phases. At the beginning of the continuation-therapy phase, those patients in complete remission were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. Control patients were given conventional mercaptopurine and methotrexate chemotherapy only. Patients in the treatment arm were also given pulses of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 weekly for 2 weeks) and dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 daily for 7 days) every 10 weeks for six cycles. The primary outcome measure was disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT00411541. FINDINGS: 174 patients (5.6%) relapsed or died in complete remission before randomisation. Of the remaining 2935 patients, 2618 (89.2%) were randomly assigned: 1325 to the treatment group and 1293 to the control group. With median follow-up of 4.8 years, 240 children in the treatment group and 241 in the control group had relapses; 15 in the treatment group and 14 controls died in complete remission or developed second malignant neoplasms. The 5-year and 7-year disease-free survival estimates were 79.8% (SE 1.2) and 77.5% (1.5) in the treatment group and 79.2% (1.2) and 78.4% (1.3) in the control group, respectively. Treatment with pulses of vincristine and dexamethasone was associated with a non-significant 3% relative-risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.81-1.15; p=0.70).

The imatinib-resistant K562/R1, -R2 and -R3 cells showed profound declines of Bcr-Abl level and concurrently exhibited up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Ku70/80, and down-regulation of Bax, DNA-PKcs and BRCA1, suggesting that loss of Bcr-Abl after exposure to imatinib might be accompanied by other cell survival mechanism. K562/R3 cells were more sensitive to camptothecin (CPT)- and radiation-induced apoptosis than K562 cells, indicating hypersensitivity of imatinib-resistant cells to DNA damaging agents. Moreover, when K562 cells were treated with the combination of imatinib with CPT, the level of Bax and the cleavage of PARP-1 and DNA-PK were significantly increased in comparison with the effects of each drug. Therefore, our study suggests that CPT can be used to treat CML with loss of Bcr-Abl expression.","['Ju, Dong-Sik', 'Kim, Mi-Ju', 'Bae, Jae-Ho', 'Song, Hye-Soon', 'Chung, Byung-Seon', 'Lee, Min-Ki', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Lee, Hyun-Sun', 'Kim, Dong-Wan', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Ju DS', 'Kim MJ', 'Bae JH', 'Song HS', 'Chung BS', 'Lee MK', 'Kang CD', 'Lee HS', 'Kim DW', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan 602-739, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'BRCA1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Benzamides', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(06)00685-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2006.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2007 Jul 8;252(1):75-85. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.12.013.

As cytokines expressed by immune cells play an essential role during viral infection, we have studied the correlation between the expression of some Th1/Th2 cytokines, including IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, and immunological dynamics during primary and chronic HTLV-1 infection in this model. We first demonstrated that, during primary infection, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 are expressed at different times and levels. The expression of these cytokines is concomitant with the increase in the numbers of CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD16(+) cells and with the presence of tax/rex viral mRNA. These data indicate the involvement of various cell types in the antiviral immune response. Subsequently, we showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells freshly isolated from chronically infected monkeys express IFN-gamma and IL-6 at higher levels than those from uninfected animals. IFN-gamma expression is quantitatively correlated to the proviral load and to the presence of circulating effector T-cells against Tax peptide, as detected by Elispot. Further studies will be needed to determine the effective role of these cytokines and other immune system modulators in the control of viral replication during primary HTLV-1 infection or latency.","['Heraud, Jean-Michel', 'Merien, Fabrice', 'Mortreux, Frank', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Kazanji, Mirdad']","['Heraud JM', 'Merien F', 'Mortreux F', 'Mahieux R', 'Kazanji M']","['Laboratoire de Retrovirologie, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, BP6010, 97306 Cayenne, French Guiana, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saimiri', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'Viral Load']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00877-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.11.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 May 10;361(2):402-11. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.11.028.

We effectively modulated the cellular cholesterol content using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) and MbetaCD-cholesterol-inclusion complex. Pgp was not liberated from the plasma membrane during cholesterol modulation and functional inhibition of Pgp was related to varying cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that membrane fluidity does not solely account for cholesterol dependent modifications of Pgp-activity. Therefore, we isolated lipid rafts and examined distinct membrane microdomains. Both depletion and cholesterol enrichment induces a disassembly of lipid rafts. In cholesterol-depleted cell membranes a shift in the Pgp localisation to detergent soluble fractions was observed. Enrichment of membrane cholesterol changed lipid raft distribution but not the localisation of Pgp. From our data we conclude that Pgp-transport capacity depends on accurate lipid raft properties.","['Meyer dos Santos, Sascha', 'Weber, Claudia-Carolin', 'Franke, Cornelia', 'Muller, Walter E', 'Eckert, Gunter P']","['Meyer dos Santos S', 'Weber CC', 'Franke C', 'Muller WE', 'Eckert GP']","['Department of Pharmacology, ZAFES, Biocenter Niederursel, N260, Max-von-Laue Str. 9, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/04/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)02863-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.202 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Mar 2;354(1):216-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.202.

These studies utilized microarrays and quantitative PCR (QPCR), methodologies which do not permit direct, unamplified examination of mRNA expression. In addition, these studies generally only examined transcript expression in homogenates of gray matter. In the present study, we examined the expression of myelination-related genes previously implicated in schizophrenia by microarray or QPCR. Using in situ hybridization, we measured transcript expression of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), transferrin (TF), quaking (QKI), gelsolin, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3, erbb2 interacting protein, motility-related protein-1, SRY-box containing gene 10, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, peripheral myelin protein 22, and claudin-11 in both gray and white matter of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in subjects with schizophrenia (n=41) and a comparison group (n=34). We found decreased expression of MAG, QKI, TF, and CNP transcripts in white matter. We did not find any differences in expression of these transcripts between medicated (n=31) and unmedicated (n=10) schizophrenics, suggesting that these changes are not secondary to treatment with antipsychotics. Finally, we found significant positive correlations between QKI and MAG or CNP mRNA expression, suggesting that the transcription factor QKI regulates MAG and CNP expression.

The spectrum of cancers affecting this age group reflects a similar transition. The common malignant diseases of childhood - leukemias, lymphomas, tumors of the central nervous system and embryonal solid tumors (such as nephroblastoma and neuroblastoma) - are replaced in relative frequency by sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, and tumors of the male and female genital tracts. Moreover, the epithelial tumors (carcinomas), so prevalent in adults, occur (albeit at much lower frequencies) in adolescents. Within individual tumor types, biological features may be distinctive in this age group. Examples are the high prevalence of poor prognostic determinants in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and histologically higher grade forms of astrocytic/glial tumors. Particular challenges in addressing the common tumors of adolescence include the development of better categorization, especially of soft tissue sarcomas, and exploring these diseases in this age group within the developing world where most adolescents reside.","['Barr, Ronald D']",['Barr RD'],"['Health Sciences Centre, Room 3N27, McMaster University, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ont., Canada L8S 4J9. rbarr@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",2007/01/16 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0305-7372(06)00221-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2007 Nov;33(7):597-602. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.11.003.

Similar evidence is also provided using a DNase-like activity assay. In addition, the intact gelonin exhibits the highest cytotoxicity to cancer cells.

All of these disorders are clonal hematologic malignancies originating at the level of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell. Recently, activating mutations of the intracellular cytokine-signaling molecule JAK2 have been identified in > 90% of patients with PV and in 50% of those with IMF and ET. In addition, a mutation of the thrombopoietin receptor, MPLW515L, has been documented in some patients with IMF. Both mutations activate JAK-STAT signaling pathways and likely play a role in disease progression. Both ET and PV are associated with prolonged clinical courses associated with frequent thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, and progression to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. IMF has a much poorer prognosis and is associated with cytopenias, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and bone marrow fibrosis.

We report our single-institution experience on the management of relapsed acute leukemia after allogeneic transplantation. We aimed to describe the outcome of relapsed acute leukemia after allogeneic transplantation at our institution and investigate whether maneuvers intended to augment donor T cell allogeneic reactivity were associated with durable graft-versus-leukemia effects. We analyzed 310 patients with acute leukemia who received allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplants from HLA-matched donors between 1982 and 2005 (229 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 81 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Mean post-transplant follow-up was 5 years (range, 0.5-22 years). Factors associated with relapse incidence, therapy for relapse, response to treatment, and post-relapse survival were assessed. One hundred of 310 patients (32%) with acute leukemia relapsed after transplantation, including 28 of 81 patients (35%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 72 of 229 (31%) with acute myelogenous leukemia at a median of 136 days after transplantation. Median post-relapse survival periods were 51 days for the 69 patients who received chemotherapy/supportive care, 84 days for 11 recipients of donor lymphocyte infusions, 303 days for 13 recipients of second transplants, and 442 days for 7 patients treated with interferon-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. A multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that a longer time to relapse after transplantation, peripheral blood as source of stem cells, and initial post-relapse therapy with cytokines, donor lymphocyte infusions, or second transplants were associated with improved post-relapse survival (P <.001, <.001, and .025). The outlook for patients with post-transplant relapse of acute leukemia is extremely poor; currently, no single therapy consistently results in durable remissions. Our study highlights the need for clinical trials in this area. Therapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and interferon-alpha-2b is promising and will be pursued in a prospective trial at our center.","['Arellano, Martha L', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Winton, Elliott', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Waller, Edmund K']","['Arellano ML', 'Langston A', 'Winton E', 'Flowers CR', 'Waller EK']","['Emory University Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. marella@emory.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00642-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jan;13(1):116-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the infusion of HTLV-I-infected cells from HTLV-I-positive related donors could lead to the development of donor-derived ATLL under immunosuppressive conditions. Although most ATLL patients lack a suitable HLA-matched related donor and require an HTLV-I-negative unrelated donor, little information is currently available regarding the outcome of unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UBMT) for ATLL. To evaluate the role of UBMT in treating ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from 33 patients with ATLL treated by UBMT through the Japan Marrow Donor Program (JMDP). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and cumulative incidence of disease progression and progression-free mortality at 1 year after UBMT were 49.5%, 49.2%, 18.6%, and 32.3%, respectively.

We infused busulfan once daily at 130 mg/m2 for 4 days, performing pharmacokinetic analyses on plasma concentration-time data (n = 60 patients) on days 1, 3, and/or 4. Mean (percent coefficient of variation) maximum concentration, volume of distribution, half-life, and clearance were 3.6 microg/mL (13.8%), 22.6 L/m2 (20.2%), 2.73 hours (27.5%), and 109 mL/min/m2 (26%), respectively. The mean (percent coefficient of variation) and median daily areas under the curve were 4873 (21.8%) and 4871 microM x minute. Intrapatient variability in day-to-day estimated clearance was <20%, without day-to-day drug accumulation. The pharmokinetic parameters were compared with those from 47 patients given intravenous busulfan at approximately 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 32 mg/m2) every 6 hours. We conclude that there is (1) a dose proportionality based on mean and median areas under the curve, (2) unchanged estimated clearance with a 4-fold increase in dose and a 2.5-fold difference in dosing rate, (3) negligible variability in dose-to-dose pharmacokinetics and negligible interdose accumulation with once-daily administration, and (4) no change in pharmokinetic parameter(s) with concomitant use of imidazole antifungals, oral contraceptives, or phenytoin. In summary, intravenous busulfan has highly predictable, linear pharmacokinetics from 32 mg/m2 (approximately 0.8 mg/kg) to 130 mg/m2 (approximately 3.2 mg/kg).

Our laboratory has demonstrated in a murine model that vaccination of recipients after transplantation with recipient tumor vaccines does not exacerbate graft-versus-host disease but does induce meaningful graft-versus-tumor effects. We previously demonstrated that part of the reason for the lack of graft-versus-host disease from post-transplantation vaccination is due to gradual acquisition of tolerance or unresponsiveness to recipient immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigens that are ubiquitously expressed in the recipient. However, our prior studies have not critically addressed the question of whether a similar process of acquisition of unresponsiveness to or tolerance of antigens present on minimal residual disease also occurs. The present study tested the hypothesis that unresponsiveness to antigens present on minimal residual disease present at the time of HSCT would also occur. The answer to this question would have a significant effect on the potential efficacy of post-transplantation tumor vaccines. In a murine model of major histocompatibility complex matched, minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched HSCT (C3.SW female donors and C57BL/6 female recipients), we tested whether transplant recipients would acquire unresponsiveness to antigens present on small numbers of residual leukemia/lymphoma cells. We employed a male C57BL/6 lymphoid malignancy with an immunoglobulin/c-myc oncogene in these studies using as a model of tumor-restricted antigen the well-characterized male (HY) antigen system present only on the tumor but not present as ubiquitous minor antigens in the recipient. After HSCT, recipients did not mount immune responses to the ubiquitously distributed immunodominant recipient strain H7 minor histocompatibility antigen, but did retain the capacity to mount significant T cell responses to HY antigens present on small numbers of HY+ tumor cells present at transplantation. Additional studies using small numbers of nonmalignant recipient male B cells or dendritic cells as models of minimal residual disease also demonstrated that the transplant recipients retained their capacity to mount anti-HY T cell responses. After HSCT, recipients may retain the capacity to mount effective T cell responses to antigens present on minimal residual disease and still acquire relative tolerance to ubiquitously distributed immunodominant minor antigens that are related to graft-versus-host disease.","['Natzke, Amanda Martinelli', 'Shaw, Joanne L', 'McKeller, Morgan R', 'Emo, Kris Lambert', 'Mullen, Craig A']","['Natzke AM', 'Shaw JL', 'McKeller MR', 'Emo KL', 'Mullen CA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (H-Y Antigen)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'H-Y Antigen/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*immunology', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00646-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jan;13(1):34-45. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.09.008.,['1R01CA10628-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a pooled analysis of 9 trials performed by Cancer and Leukemia Group B was done to determine if men with metastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer who underwent prior prostatectomy had improved clinical outcomes, such as overall, prostate specific, progression-free and PSA progression-free survival, than men who did not undergo prior prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 9 multi-institutional trials performed by Cancer and Leukemia Group B were combined. Eligible patients had progressive prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate hematological, renal and hepatic functions. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic importance of radical prostatectomy for predicting clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1,238 men 310 (25%) underwent prostatectomy. Median survival was 14.7 (95% CI 12.9-16.7) and 14.5 months (95% CI 13.5-15.7) in men who did and did not undergo prostatectomy, respectively. The HR for death was 1.03 (95% CI 0.90-1.19, p = 0.65) in men with vs without prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Prior prostatectomy in men with metastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer who were subsequently enrolled on clinical trials for cancer treatment had similar survival compared to men who did not undergo prior prostatectomy. These data do not support another report suggesting that prior prostatectomy confers a subsequent survival advantage in men with castration recurrent prostate cancer.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Ou, San-San', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Ou SS', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,['0 (Androgen Antagonists)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Orchiectomy', '*Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5347(06)02491-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2006.09.050 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2007 Feb;177(2):531-4. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2006.09.050.,['CA 36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to explore the correlation of Flt-3/ITD mutation to the occurrence of pediatric leukemia, and analyze its clinical significance. METHODS: Flt-3/ITD mutation status in bone marrow samples from 302 children with leukemia, including 122 cases of AML, 124 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 17 cases of juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML), and 39 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 122 AML patients, 98 (80.32%) had Flt-3 gene products in bone marrow. Flt-3/ITD mutation was detected in 21 (17.21%) of the 122 patients; the mutation rates were 42.86% (3/7) in M0, 22.22% (2/9) in M1, 12.90% (4/31) in M2, 44.44% (8/18) in M4, and 15.38% (4/26) in M5. Of the 124 ALL patients, 72 (58.06%) had Flt-3 gene products in bone marrow. Flt-3/ITD mutation was found in 2 (1.61%) of the 72 patients. DNA sequencing and Blast alignment revealed that ITD within exon 11 existed in all samples, with various duplication regions and lengths (24-95 bp). No Flt-3/ITD mutation was found in MDS patients and JCML patients. Of the 19 AML patients with Flt3/ITD mutation, the median survival time was 13.5 months (0-47 months), which was significantly shorter than that of the patients without Flt-3/ITD mutation (P<0.05). The percentage of neutrophils in peripheral blood was similar in Flt-3/ITD-positive and Flt-3/ITD-negative patients (P>0.05). Chromosome karyotype analysis showed chromosome abnormity, including t(11; 12)(p15; q13), inv16(q21; q23), and t(6; 9)(p23; q23), in 3 AML patients with Flt-3/ITD. CONCLUSIONS: Flt-3/ITD mutations are usually detected in AML, seldom in ALL, not in MDS and JCML. Flt-3/ITD mutation is correlated to AML onset and progress. Flt-3/ITD is a significant marker to analyze AML prognosis.","['Wang, Jie', 'Wang, Tong', 'Li, Shu', 'Lin, Li', 'Gang, Yan']","['Wang J', 'Wang T', 'Li S', 'Lin L', 'Gang Y']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shenyang Medical College, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110034, P.

This study was to detect EBV infection in pediatric leukemia, and to explore its clinical significance. METHODS: EBV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 35 pediatric leukemia patients, including 26 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (24 received initial treatment and 2 received retreatment), 8 cases of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and 1 case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and in 14 healthy children was detected by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR). Its clinical significance was analyzed according to the clinical manifestations, prednisone sensitivity test, and complete remission (CR) rate after induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: EBV DNA was detected in 8 (22.86%) of the 35 pediatric leukemia patients. The positive rate of EBV DNA was 26.92% (7/26) in ALL with quantity of (5.144+/-6.91)x10(5) copies/ml, and 12.5% (1/8) in ANLL patients with quantity of 4.031x10(3) copies/ml. No EBV DNA was detected in CLL patients and healthy controls. The occurrence rates of peripheral leukocytosis and hepatosplenomegaly were significantly higher in the patients with EBV infection than in the patients without EBV infection (P <0.001). In ALL, the rate of no response to prednisone was significantly higher in the patients with EBV infection than in the patients without EBV infection (100% vs. 26.32%, P =0.001); CR rate after induction chemotherapy was significantly lower in the patients with EBV infection than in the patients without EBV infection (28.57% vs. 84.21%, P=0.003). In ANLL, the differences of CR rate and relapse rate were not significant between the patients with and without EBV infection (P=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric leukemia patients with EBV infection have higher incidence of peripheral leukocytosis and hepatosplenomegaly.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 376,825 1-year survivors of BC within 4 nationwide, population-based cancer registries in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway (1943-2001). Estimates of EAR (per 100,000 person-years) were modeled using Poisson regression methods and cumulative risks calculated using a competing risk model. RESULTS: A total of 687 non-chronic lymphocytic leukemias (EAR = 9.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.5-10.7) was reported. Significantly elevated risks were observed for the first time for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (EAR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.3-2.9) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (EAR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.2-1.1), in addition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (EAR = 5.00; 95% CI = 3.9-6.2). Excesses of CML, ALL, AML and all leukemias combined persisted over 25 years after BC diagnosis. For all leukemias, EAR decreased with increasing calendar year (P = 0.04) of BC diagnosis. Risk for all leukemia and AML by calendar year of BC diagnosis depended on age at diagnosis. For women diagnosed with BC after 1985, the 10-year cumulative risk of leukemia for those diagnosed before and after age 50 was small, 0.10% and 0.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although secondary leukemia is a rare event, BC survivors experience statistically significant excesses for at least 25 years after diagnosis, including CML and ALL. Decreasing leukemia risks in recent calendar years likely reflect changes in treatment.","['Howard, Regan A', 'Gilbert, Ethel S', 'Chen, Bingshu E', 'Hall, Per', 'Storm, Hans', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Langmark, Froydis', 'Kaijser, Magnus', 'Andersson, Michael', 'Joensuu, Heikki', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Howard RA', 'Gilbert ES', 'Chen BE', 'Hall P', 'Storm H', 'Pukkala E', 'Langmark F', 'Kaijser M', 'Andersson M', 'Joensuu H', 'Fossa SD', 'Travis LB']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Department of Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Executive Plaza South, Suite 7091, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. reganho@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2007/01/16 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-006-9460-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2007 Nov;105(3):359-68. doi: 10.1007/s10549-006-9460-0.

Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for quartile of birth weight, birth order, gestational age, maternal age at delivery, prior fetal loss, pre-pregnancy body mass index, and weight gain during pregnancy were obtained using unconditional logistic regression; P for linear trend was obtained by modeling continuous variables. There was a borderline significant linear trend of increasing birth weight with MLL(+) (P = 0.06), but not MLL(-) (P = 0.93), infant leukemia. Increasing birth order showed a significant inverse linear trend, independent of birth weight, with MLL(+) (P = 0.01), but not MLL(-) (P = 0.18), infant leukemia.

Patients have a short survival and often progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The diagnosis of MDS can be difficult; there is a paucity of molecular markers, and the pathophysiology is largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter study investigating whether serum proteome profiling may serve as a noninvasive platform to discover novel molecular markers for MDS. We generated serum proteome profiles from 218 individuals by MS and identified a profile that distinguishes MDS from non-MDS cytopenias in a learning sample set. This profile was validated by testing its ability to predict MDS in a first independent validation set and a second, prospectively collected, independent validation set run 5 months apart. Accuracy was 80.5% in the first and 79.0% in the second validation set. Peptide mass fingerprinting and quadrupole TOF MS identified two differential proteins: CXC chemokine ligands 4 (CXCL4) and 7 (CXCL7), both of which had significantly decreased serum levels in MDS, as confirmed with independent antibody assays. Western blot analyses of platelet lysates for these two platelet-derived molecules revealed a lack of CXCL4 and CXCL7 in MDS. Subtype analyses revealed that these two proteins have decreased serum levels in advanced MDS, suggesting the possibility of a concerted disturbance of transcription or translation of these chemokines in advanced MDS.","['Aivado, Manuel', 'Spentzos, Dimitrios', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Alterovitz, Gil', 'Meng, Xiao-Ying', 'Grall, Franck', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles A N', 'Klement, Giannoula', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Otu, Hasan H', 'Czibere, Akos', 'Prall, Wolf C', 'Iking-Konert, Christof', 'Shayne, Michelle', 'Ramoni, Marco F', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Mitsiades, Constantine S', 'Fung, Eric T', 'Libermann, Towia A']","['Aivado M', 'Spentzos D', 'Germing U', 'Alterovitz G', 'Meng XY', 'Grall F', 'Giagounidis AA', 'Klement G', 'Steidl U', 'Otu HH', 'Czibere A', 'Prall WC', 'Iking-Konert C', 'Shayne M', 'Ramoni MF', 'Gattermann N', 'Haas R', 'Mitsiades CS', 'Fung ET', 'Libermann TA']","['Proteomics Core and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/*chemistry', 'Chemokines, CXC/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', '*Proteome']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0610330104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0610330104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jan 23;104(4):1307-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0610330104.

The effect of TSA on the growth of Molt-4 cells was studied by MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle. The expression of HDAC8 was detected by using immunocytochemistry and Western blot. The results showed that proliferation of Molt-4 cells was inhibited in TSA-treated group in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of TSA exposures for 24 h and 36 h were 254.3236 and 199.257 microg/L respectively. The cell cycle analysis revealed that Molt-4 was mostly in G0/G1 phase, and after treatment with TSA from 50 to 400 microg/L for 24 h, the percents of G0/G1 cells were decreased and cells were arrested in G2/M phase. Treatment of TSA for 24 h could significantly inhibit the expression of HDAC8 protein in Molt-4 cells (P<0.01). It was concluded that TSA could decrease the expression of HDAC8 in Molt-4 cells, which contributed to the inhibition of proliferation and induction of cell cycle arrest in Molt-4 cells.","['He, Jing', 'Liu, Hongli', 'Chen, Yan']","['He J', 'Liu H', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Uncertainties still exist about other respiratory cancers. OBJECTIVES: We carried out a historical mortality study among workers ofa plant producing sulphuric acid in Tuscany, Italy. METHODS: We reconstructed a cohort of 1372 male and 37female workers with at least one year of employment at the plant in the period 1962-97; 46% ofthe workers had previously been working in pyrite mines in the area where rocks have a high silica content. Environmental measurements of sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide from the 1970's were generally below the TLVs. Mortality was investigated as of August 2000; Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) were calculated using Tuscany reference rates. RESULTS: Overall mortality was below expectation (SMR 77). In labourers, larynx cancer deaths were 4 vs 3.1 expected (SMR 130, 95% CI 35-333), while mortality from lung cancer was below expectation (27/32.8, SMR 82, 95% CI 54-120). An excess of myeloid leukaemia was observed mainly in workers without previous experience in mines (3/0.6, SMR 523, 95% CI 108-1527). Mortality from silicosis, but not from lung cancer, was remarkably high among workers with previous employment in mines. CONCLUSIONS: Among workers employed in sulphuric acid production, with or without previous experience in mines, we did not observe increased mortality from larynx or lung cancer. The increased mortality from myeloid leukaemia cannot be attributed to any of the exposures documented in the study plant and requires further investigation.","['Pesatori, Angela Cecilia', 'Consonni, D', 'Rubagotti, Maurizia', 'Bonzini, M', 'Catalano, P', 'Bertazzi, P A']","['Pesatori AC', 'Consonni D', 'Rubagotti M', 'Bonzini M', 'Catalano P', 'Bertazzi PA']","['Dipartimento di Medicina del Lavoro, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Clinica del Lavoro L Devoto, Milano.

Histological diagnoses of the primary tumor were as follows: non-Hodgkin diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3 patients), acute mycloid leukemia (3 patients), serous papillary adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated neoplasm, mesothelioma, and melanoma. The most common mammographic finding was a well-circumscribed mass with increased density but without speculation, calcifications or other signs that characterize the majority of primary carcinomas. Ultrasound revealed well-circumscribed masses without retrotumor acoustic shadowing. The interval between diagnosis of primary cancer and the appearance of breast metastasis ranged from 0 to 108 months (mean: 17, median: 1). Survival after the detection of the breast metastases ranged from 0.2 to 144 months (mean: 23, median: 9.5). In conclusion, metastasis can mimic either benign disease or primary malignancy and is often an unexpected diagnosis in a patient presenting with a breast mass. Thus, an accurate diagnosis is important to avoid unnecessary mutilating surgery. These masses generally indicate disseminated metastatic disease, with a very poor survival rate.","['Ribeiro-Silva, Alfredo', 'Mendes, Carina Fabricia', 'Costa, Igor Santos', 'de Moura, Heveline Becker', 'Tiezzi, Daniel Guimaraes', 'Andrade, Jurandyr Moreira']","['Ribeiro-Silva A', 'Mendes CF', 'Costa IS', 'de Moura HB', 'Tiezzi DG', 'Andrade JM']","['Department of Pathology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. arsilva@fmrp.usp.b']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Pathol,Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists,9437432,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*secondary', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/diagnostic imaging/secondary', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mammography', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Metastasis/diagnostic imaging', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol J Pathol. 2006;57(3):161-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here show that zebrafish fgf1 is involved in vivo in primitive hematopoiesis. Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) morpholino knockdown leads to abnormal accumulation of blood cells in the posterior intermediate cell mass at 32 hr postfertilization. Expression of the erythroid markers gata1 and ika, normally diminishing in differentiating erythrocytes at this stage, is maintained at abnormally high levels in primitive blood cells. The onset of erythrocyte differentiation as assessed by o-dianisidine staining is severely delayed. Most fgf1 morphants later recover to wild-type appearance, and primitive erythrocytes eventually differentiate. Zebrafish fgf1 is syntenic to human FGF1, which maps to a critically deleted region in human del(5q) syndrome posing an increased risk of leukemia to patients. As its knockdown in zebrafish changes expression of gata1, a gene involved in hematopoietic stem cell decisions, FGF1 should be considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of del(5q) syndrome.","['Songhet, Pascal', 'Adzic, Dejan', 'Reibe, Saskia', 'Rohr, Klaus B']","['Songhet P', 'Adzic D', 'Reibe S', 'Rohr KB']","['University of Cologne, Institute for Developmental Biology, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (ikzf1 protein, zebrafish)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/genetics/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics/physiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/08/02 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvdy.21056 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2007 Mar;236(3):633-43. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.21056.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that ASODN-2 targeting the 5' non-coding region of sites -62 to -46, and ASODN-3 targeting the 5' coding region of sites -1 to 16, both reduced apoptosis measured by gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry.

It causes infection in immunosuppressed hosts, especially those who are neutropaenic, on chemotherapy and broad spectrum antibiotics. Skin and soft tissue manifestations of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection are becoming an increasingly recognised entity; the clinical spectrum ranges from mucocutaneous, skin to soft tissue infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case of an 8-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukaemia who developed metastatic skin lesions secondary to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia. The authors reviewed a total of 24 reported cases of mucocutaneous, skin and soft tissue infections by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The presentations include metastatic cellulitis, primary cellulitis and infected mucocutaneous ulcers. RESULTS: This is the first locally reported case of metastatic nodular skin lesions caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia. This is also the first reported paediatric case of embolic skin lesions caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Of the 6 cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia seen in the paediatric oncology patients from year 2000 to 2004 at our hospital, only 1 case developed metastatic skin lesions. CONCLUSION: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia skin infection should be included into the list of differential diagnoses for metastatic skin lesions in neutropaenic patients, especially with an underlying haematologic malignancy who has received recent chemotherapy and broad spectrum antibiotics. Haematologic malignancy, transplantation, neutropaenic, immunosuppressive therapy and a high severity of illness score were important prognostic factors.","['Teo, Wan Yee', 'Chan, Mei Yoke', 'Lam, Ching Mei', 'Chong, Chia Yin']","['Teo WY', 'Chan MY', 'Lam CM', 'Chong CY']","[""Department of Paediatric Medicine, Kandang Kerbau Women's & Children's Hospital, Singapore.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Cellulitis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/*epidemiology', '*Stenotrophomonas maltophilia', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/therapeutic use']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2006 Dec;35(12):897-900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the cytotoxicity of highly purified jolkinolide B was tested in human chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) and 2 other cell lines (human esophageal carcinoma Eca-109 and human hepatoma HepG2). The results indicate a significant decrease in the proliferation of all the 3 cell lines when treated with jolkinolide B for 24 h; the IC50 value of cytotoxicity was 12.1 microg/mL (for K562 cells), >50.0 microg/mL (for HepG2 cells), and 23.7 microg/mL (for Eca-109 cells). Further study of K562 cells involving fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed characteristic apoptotic features, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, loss of microvilli, and nuclear condensation. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA showed a typical fragmentation pattern for apoptotic cells. A kinetic cell-cycle analysis demonstrated that the cell cycle was arrested in the G1 phase. All these results suggest that the anti-proliferation effect of jolkinolide B on K562 cells is achieved by arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase and subsequently inducing apoptosis.","['Luo, Huiying', 'Wang, Aiqin']","['Luo H', 'Wang A']","['Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, P.R.

METHODS: Seven children (four boys, three girls; age: 5.1 +/- 1.2 yr, body mass: 24.0 +/- 5.8 kg, height: 114.6 +/- 7.7 cm) in the maintenance phase of treatment against ALL performed three sessions per week for 16 wk of resistance (one set of 8-15 repetitions of 11 exercises) and aerobic training (30 min at > 70% HRmax) followed by 20 wk of detraining where no structured exercise program was performed. Before training, after training, and after detraining, a treadmill test determining .VO2peak and ventilator threshold (VT), muscular strength (6RM), functional mobility (timed up and down stairs test, time up and go 3-m and 10-m tests), passive and dynamic ankle range of motion, and self-reported quality of living were determined. RESULTS: After training, significant increases in .VO2peak, VT, upper- and lower-body muscular strength, and all measures of functional mobility were shown (P < 0.05). Muscular strength was well maintained (significantly greater than before training and no significant decrease from after training) during detraining, whereas .VO2peak, VT, and functional mobility (not significantly different from before training but no significant decrease from after training) were only partially retained. CONCLUSION: Young children in the maintenance phase of treatment against ALL can safely perform both aerobic and resistance training. Training results in significant increases in measures of aerobic fitness, strength, and functional mobility. During detraining, strength and functional mobility are well maintained, whereas .VO2peak and VT are partially maintained.","['San Juan, Alejandro F', 'Fleck, Steven J', 'Chamorro-Vina, Carolina', 'Mate-Munoz, Jose Luis', 'Moral, Susana', 'Perez, Margarita', 'Cardona, Claudia', 'Del Valle, Maria Fernandez', 'Hernandez, Mercedes', 'Ramirez, Manuel', 'Madero, Luis', 'Lucia, Alejandro']","['San Juan AF', 'Fleck SJ', 'Chamorro-Vina C', 'Mate-Munoz JL', 'Moral S', 'Perez M', 'Cardona C', 'Del Valle MF', 'Hernandez M', 'Ramirez M', 'Madero L', 'Lucia A']","['European University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,8005433,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', '*Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Program Evaluation', 'Quality of Life', 'Spain', 'Weight Lifting/*physiology']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/03/17 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1249/01.mss.0000240326.54147.fc [doi]', '00005768-200701000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2007 Jan;39(1):13-21. doi: 10.1249/01.mss.0000240326.54147.fc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fibrosis is characterized by the persistence of activated myofibroblasts, ineffective re-epithelialization, and variable degrees of inflammation within injured tissues. The protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), imatinib mesylate, has been proposed as a potential antifibrotic therapeutic agent. In this study, the efficacy of imatinib mesylate to modulate fibrogenic responses, both in vitro and in vivo, was examined. In an in vitro fibroblast culture model, imatinib inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation and fibroblast proliferation but not the stably differentiated myofibroblast phenotype. Furthermore, imatinib inhibits lung epithelial cell proliferation and survival but not the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Imatinib does not alter transforming growth factor-beta/SMAD3 signaling in either cell type. In a murine model of lung fibrosis, bleomycin-induced injury to the pulmonary epithelium provokes an early inflammatory response with more delayed fibrosis during the late reparative phase of lung injury. Imatinib mesylate (10 mg/kg/day by i.p. injection or oral gavage), administered during the postinjury repair phase, failed to significantly alter fibrogenic responses assessed by histopathology, collagen content, and the accumulation of myofibroblasts within the injured lung. These studies indicate that the capacity of a PKI to inhibit fibroblast proliferation may be insufficient to mediate significant antifibrotic effects in late stages of tissue injury repair. Pharmacologic agents that modulate the activities and fate of differentiated (myo)fibroblasts, without interfering with the regenerative capacity of epithelial cells, are likely to be more effective for treatment of nonresolving, progressive fibrotic disorders.","['Vittal, Ragini', 'Zhang, Hengmin', 'Han, Meilan K', 'Moore, Bethany B', 'Horowitz, Jeffrey C', 'Thannickal, Victor J']","['Vittal R', 'Zhang H', 'Han MK', 'Moore BB', 'Horowitz JC', 'Thannickal VJ']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, 6301 MSRB III, 1150 W.

We developed a system where small hairpin (sh)RNAs can be induced in embryonic stem (ES) cells from a defined locus following integration by Flp recombinase-mediated DNA recombination. To verify the system, the key transcription factor Stat3, which maintains pluripotency, was downregulated by shRNA, and the expected morphological and biochemical markers of differentiation were observed. Induction of shRNA specific for the post-transcriptional regulator Brf1 (Zfp36L1) amplified the cardiac markers with strong stimulation of cardiomyocyte formation within embryoid bodies. These findings identify Brf1 as a novel potential regulator of cardiomyocyte formation and suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms are of importance to early development and, possibly, to regenerative medicine.

The progression to accelerated phase and blast crisis is driven by activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and/or amplification of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which causes the chronic phase of the disease. The cell of origin of blast crisis is a subject of speculation. Here, I develop a simple mathematical model of CML blast crisis to investigate whether blasts arise from leukemic stem cells or more differentiated leukemic cells. I use data of patients treated with imatinib and previous agents to estimate the effects of therapy on the rate of progression. Imatinib reduces the progression rate 10-fold as compared with previous (ineffective) therapies. If blasts were produced by leukemic stem cells, there would be no difference in the rate of progression between patients treated with imatinib and previous therapies, because imatinib seems to be incapable of depleting leukemic stem cells. Imatinib does, however, deplete leukemic progenitors. Therefore, CML blasts are likely to arise from leukemic progenitors.

Although normally not expressed in myeloid progenitors, PAX5 has recently been shown to be frequently expressed in myeloid malignancies and to suppress expression of myeloid differentiation genes, compatible with an effect on the differentiation or maintenance of myeloid progenitors. However, previous studies in which PAX5 was ectopically expressed in normal myeloid progenitors in vivo and in vitro provided conflicting results as to the effect of PAX5 on myeloid development. Herein, we demonstrate that on ectopic expression of PAX5 in bone marrow multipotent stem/progenitor cells, cells with a biphenotypic B220(+)GR-1/MAC-1(+) phenotype are produced. These remain cytokine-dependent, but unlike control-transduced cells they sustain long-term generation of myeloid progenitors in vitro and remain capable of myeloid differentiation. Notably, PAX5(+)B220(+)GR-1/MAC-1(+) myeloid progenitors coexpress, at the single-cell level, myeloid genes and otherwise B-cell-specific PAX5 target genes. These findings establish that ectopic expression of PAX5 introduces extensive self-renewal properties in otherwise short-lived myeloid progenitors. Along with the established ectopic expression of PAX5 in acute myeloid leukemia, this motivates a careful investigation of the potential involvement of ectopic PAX5 expression in myeloid and biphenotypic leukemias.","['Anderson, Kristina', 'Rusterholz, Corinne', 'Mansson, Robert', 'Jensen, Christina T', 'Bacos, Karl', 'Zandi, Sasan', 'Sasaki, Yutaka', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W']","['Anderson K', 'Rusterholz C', 'Mansson R', 'Jensen CT', 'Bacos K', 'Zandi S', 'Sasaki Y', 'Nerlov C', 'Sigvardsson M', 'Jacobsen SE']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Lund Strategic Research Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Lund University, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gr-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41614-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-026021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 1;109(9):3697-705. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-026021.

TEL/PDGFbetaR activates multiple signal transduction pathways in cell-culture systems, and expression of the TEL-PDGFRB fusion gene induces myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in mice. We used gene-targeted mice to characterize the contribution of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) and Src family genes to TEL-PDGFRB-mediated transformation in methylcellulose colony and murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation assays. Fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells harboring targeted deletion of both Stat5a and Stat5b (Stat5ab(null/null)) genes were refractory to transformation by TEL-PDGFRB in methylcellulose colony assays. Notably, these cell populations were maintained in Stat5ab(null/null) fetal livers and succumbed to transformation by c-Myc. Surprisingly, targeted disruption of either Stat5a or Stat5b alone also impaired TEL-PDGFRB-mediated transformation. Survival of TPiGFP-->Stat5a(-/-) and TPiGFP-->Stat5a(+/-) mice was significantly prolonged, demonstrating significant sensitivity of TEL-PDGFRB-induced MPD to the dosage of Stat5a. TEL-PDGFRB-mediated MPD was incompletely penetrant in TPiGFP-->Stat5b(-/-) mice. In contrast, Src family kinases Lyn, Hck, and Fgr and the Stat family member Stat1 were dispensable for TEL-PDGFRB disease. Together, these data demonstrate that Stat5a and Stat5b are dose-limiting mediators of TEL-PDGFRB-induced myeloproliferation.","['Cain, Jennifer A', 'Xiang, Zhifu', ""O'Neal, Julie"", 'Kreisel, Friederike', 'Colson, AnnaLynn', 'Luo, Hui', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Tomasson, Michael H']","['Cain JA', 'Xiang Z', ""O'Neal J"", 'Kreisel F', 'Colson A', 'Luo H', 'Hennighausen L', 'Tomasson MH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University Siteman Cancer Center, 550 S.

Cotreatment of K562 or LAMA cells with subtoxic or marginally toxic concentrations of PD184352 (or U0126) and dasatinib synergistically potentiated mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were observed in CD34(+) cells from one CML patient-derived but not in a normal human CD34(+) bone marrow cell specimen. These interactions were associated with multiple perturbations in survival signaling pathways, including inactivation of Bcr/Abl, STAT5, and ERK1/2; down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1; and dephosphorylation/activation of Bim. They were also associated with BAX/BAK conformational change, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase activation. Bim knockdown by shRNA suppressed BAX and BAK conformational change and protected cells from dasatinib/PD184352 lethality. Conversely, K562 cells ectopically expressing Mcl-1 or Bcl-x(L) were significantly less susceptible to dasatinib/PD184352 toxicity. Notably, the dasatinib/PD184352 regimen was active against leukemic cells exhibiting various forms of imatinib mesylate resistance, including Bcr/Abl overexpression, Lyn activation, and several Bcr/Abl kinase domain mutations (eg, E255K, M351T), but not T315I.

Among the diagnostic parameters predicting relapse, heterogeneity in the in vitro differentiation rate of blasts is an independent factor. To identify biologic networks involved in resistance, we conducted pharmacogenomic studies in APL blasts displaying distinct ATRA sensitivities. Although the expression profiles of genes invested in differentiation were similarly modulated in low- and high-sensitive blasts, low-sensitive cells showed higher levels of transcription of ATRA-target genes, transcriptional regulators, chromatin remodelers, and transcription factors. In opposition, only high-sensitive blasts expressed the CYP26A1 gene, encoding the p450 cytochrome which is known to be involved in retinoic acid catabolism. In NB4 cells, ATRA treatment activates a novel signaling pathway, whereby interleukin-8 stimulates the expression of the homeobox transcription factor HOXA10v2, an effective enhancer of CYP26A1 transcription. These data were corroborated in primary APL cells, as maturation levels correlated with CYP26A1 expression. Treatment with a retinoic acid metabolism blocking agent (RAMBA) results in high-nucleoplasmic concentrations of retinoid and growth of NB4-resistant subclones. Hence, for APL blasts associated with poor prognosis, the low CYP26A1 expression may explain high risk of resistance installation, by increased retinoid pressure. Pharmacogenomic profiles of genes involved in retinoid acid metabolism may help to optimize anticancer therapies, including retinoids.","['Quere, Ronan', 'Baudet, Aurelie', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Bertrand, Gerald', 'Marti, Jacques', 'Manchon, Laurent', 'Piquemal, David', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Commes, Therese']","['Quere R', 'Baudet A', 'Cassinat B', 'Bertrand G', 'Marti J', 'Manchon L', 'Piquemal D', 'Chomienne C', 'Commes T']","[""Groupe d'Etude des Transcriptomes, Institut de genetique humaine, Unite Propre de Recherche, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Library', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41571-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-10-051086 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 May 15;109(10):4450-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-051086.

Following 3 hours of exposure no significant changes in gene expression could be identified. Following 8 hours of exposure, 51 genes were differentially expressed (P < .001 and false discovery rate < 10%) with 39 genes being up-regulated (median, 2.4-fold) and 12 genes were down-regulated (median, 1.7-fold).

Cytokines contribute to this process by negatively regulating steady-state levels of Bim mRNA. Here we present a molecular mechanism for cytokine-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of Bim mRNA by heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), which binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region of specific mRNAs and enhances their stability. The RNA binding potential of Hsc70 is regulated by cochaperones including Bag-4 (also SODD), CHIP, Hip, and Hsp40. Cytokines regulate the expression or function of these cochaperones by activating Ras pathways. Thus, exposure of cells to cytokines ultimately leads to destabilization of Bim mRNA and promotion of cell survival. This unanticipated role of a chaperone/cochaperone complex in mRNA stability appears to be critical for hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.","['Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Asou, Hiroya', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Matsui H', 'Asou H', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (HNRNPD protein, human)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (Hnrpd protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Protein I)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Poly(A)-Binding Protein I/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Stability/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/09 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(06)00843-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2007 Jan 12;25(1):99-112. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-2/DX100 also showed resistance to radiation. AML-2/DX100 characterized by down-regulated catalase expression was supersensitive to exogenous hydrogen peroxide whereas they increased defense mechanisms against endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) as compared with AML-2/WT. In AML-2/WT, radiation increased Bax expression and its translocation to mitochondria but had little effect on translocation of Bcl-2 and consequently induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria with the subsequent caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, in AML-2/DX100, radiation neither increased Bax expression nor its translocation to mitochondria while it increased Bcl-2 translocation to mitochondria. A specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 increased radioresistance in AML-2/WT but little in AML-2/DX100. It inhibited radiation-induced Bax translocation in AML-2/WT but not in AML-2/DX100, indicating that p38 MAPK is working after irradiation in AML-2/WT but not in AML-2/DX100. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis revealed that NF-kappaB in AML-2/DX100 was more activated with degradation of cytosolic IkappaBalpha than was that of AML-2/WT. cDNA microarray showed that Bfl-1/A1 and granzyme H in AML-2/DX100 were highly up-regulated (6.21-fold) and down-regulated (6.49-fold), respectively, as compared with each of AML-2/WT, which were confirmed by RT-PCR assay. Taken together, these results indicate that radioresistance mechanisms of AML-2/DX100 could be related to alterations in ROS-scavenging activity, in mitochondrial translocation of Bax and Bcl-2, and in expression of pro-apoptotic (granzyme H) and anti-apoptotic (Bfl-1/A1) genes. It has been shown that balance of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signals is a determinant in radiosensitivity of AML-2/WT and AML-2/DX100.","['Choi, Cheol-Hee', 'Xu, Haidong', 'Bark, Hyun', 'Lee, Tae-Bum', 'Yun, Jisoo', 'Kang, Sung-In', 'Oh, Yoon-Kyeong']","['Choi CH', 'Xu H', 'Bark H', 'Lee TB', 'Yun J', 'Kang SI', 'Oh YK']","['Research Center for Resistant Cells, Chosun University, Gwangju 501-759, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'X-Rays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00451-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Sep;31(9):1267-76. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.11.006.

METHODS: (1) Thirty patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The levels of donor CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell were compared in the patients with GVHD and those without GVHD with immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. (2) The donor BM expressions of FOXP(3) mRNA levels were analyzed by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: (1) All patients achieved engraftment. The median time for ANC > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L and PLT > or = 20 x 10(9)/L were attained at day 14 (range, 12-15) and day 18 (range, 15-25) respectively. With a median follow-up of 12.8 (8-16) months, acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurred in 15 of the 30 patients (50.0%) with grade II-IV aGVHD (40.0%). Chronic GVHD developed in 6 (extensive 2, limited 4) out of the 30 patients (20.0%). (2) The levels of donor CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell pre-and post-mobilization were (2.67 +/- 0.38)% and (5.01 +/- 1.33)% respectively; no difference was observed (P > 0.05). (3) Patients with I-II aGVHD demonstrated higher donor-type CD4+CD25+ immune regulatory T cell level than those with III-IV aGVHD. Patients with III-IV aGVHD showed much lower donor-type CD4+CD25+ immune regulatory T cell level than those without GVHD. No difference was observed between the patients withI-II aGVHD and those without aGVHD. (4) The transcripts of FOXP(3) donor BM were detected in seven donors for the thirty recipients who received allo-HSCT. Among the seven patients who received stem cells from these donors five had no GVHD after transplantation and the remaining two developed I aGVHD. Donor BM FOXP(3) transcripts were never detected in patients with II-IV aGVHD. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Donor-type CD4+CD25+ immune regulatory T cell level was related to recipient II-IV aGVHD.

In this study we investigated the mechanisms of H. pylori-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes, which could explain a mechanism of immune evasion facilitating chronic inflammation of the mucosa and gastric carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The supernatant of H. pylori culture was used to study the mechanism of apoptosis induction in human leukaemia T cell lines Jurkat and CEM and in primary T cells. The cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (Vac A) positive bacterial strain H. pylori 60190 (CagA(+), VacA(+)) and as a control the less toxic H. pylori strain Tx30a (CagA(-), VacA(-)) were used to produce the supernatant. Cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation and protein expression by Western blot. RESULTS: H. pylori 60190-induced apoptosis was neither blocked by inhibition of the death ligands TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), CD95L/FasL and TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-a) in wild type Jurkat cells nor in FADD(def) (Fas-associated death domain protein) and caspase-8(def) subclones of the Jurkat cell line. Yet, the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk could inhibit up to 90% of H. pylori-induced apoptosis. Stable transfection of Jurkat wild type cells with Bcl-x(L and) Bcl-2 resulted in marked reduction of H. pylori-induced apoptosis, showing that the mitochondrial pathway is the key regulator. This is supported by the finding that surviving primary human lymphocytes upregulate Bcl-2 when exposed to H. pylori supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori-induced apoptosis of T cells is mediated by the mitochondrial pathway and could create a local environment that facilitates life-long infection by immune evasion.","['Ganten, T M', 'Aravena, E', 'Sykora, J', 'Koschny, R', 'Mohr, J', 'Rudi, J', 'Stremmel, W', 'Walczak, H']","['Ganten TM', 'Aravena E', 'Sykora J', 'Koschny R', 'Mohr J', 'Rudi J', 'Stremmel W', 'Walczak H']","['University of Heidelberg, Germany.

Heightened interest in these entities stems from their ability to enhance cellular delivery of associated macromolecules, such as genes and proteins, suggesting that they may have widespread applications as drug-delivery vectors. Proposed uptake mechanisms include energy-independent plasma membrane translocation and energy-dependent vesicular uptake and internalization through endocytic pathways. In the present study, we investigated the effects of temperature, peptide concentration and plasma membrane cholesterol levels on the uptake of a model cell-penetrating peptide, L-octa-arginine (L-R8) and its D-enantiomer (D-R8) in CD34+ leukaemia cells. We found that, at 4-12 degrees C, L-R8 uniformly labels the cytoplasm and nucleus, but in cells incubated with D-R8 there is additional labelling of the nucleolus which is still prominent at 30 degrees C incubations. At temperatures between 12 and 30 degrees C, the peptides are also localized to endocytic vesicles which consequently appear as the only labelled structures in cells incubated at 37 degrees C. Small increases in the extracellular peptide concentration in 37 degrees C incubations result in a dramatic increase in the fraction of the peptide that is localized to the cytosol and promoted the binding of D-R8 to the nucleolus. Enhanced labelling of the cytosol, nucleus and nucleolus was also achieved by extraction of plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The data argue for two, temperature-dependent, uptake mechanism for these peptides and for the existence of a threshold concentration for endocytic uptake that when exceeded promotes direct translocation across the plasma membrane.","['Fretz, Marjan M', 'Penning, Neal A', 'Al-Taei, Saly', 'Futaki, Shiroh', 'Takeuchi, Toshihide', 'Nakase, Ikuhiko', 'Storm, Gert', 'Jones, Arwyn T']","['Fretz MM', 'Penning NA', 'Al-Taei S', 'Futaki S', 'Takeuchi T', 'Nakase I', 'Storm G', 'Jones AT']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3XF, Wales, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Peptides)', '25212-18-4 (polyarginine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides/*metabolism', '*Temperature']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20061808 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20061808 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2007 Apr 15;403(2):335-42. doi: 10.1042/BJ20061808.,,PMC1874247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all de novo APL patients undergo clinical remission when treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy or with the combinational selective therapy, ATRA plus As2O3. Combining ATRA with As2O3 as an induction followed by chemotherapy consolidation results in more profound clinical remissions compared to treatment with any agent alone or any of the other possible combinations. The mechanism of action of each of these agents differs. ATRA induces APL cell differentiation and PML-RARalpha proteolysis. As2O3 induces APL cell partial differentiation, PML-RARalpha proteolysis, and apoptosis. Chemotherapy, mainly using anthracyclines, induces APL cell death.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), aberrant transcription factors and their associated machinery play a central role in mediating the malignant phenotype. The mechanism of action of APL chimeric fusion proteins involves their ability to either self-associate or interact with different partner proteins. Thus, targeting protein-protein interactions could have a significant impact in blocking the activity of APL oncoproteins. As therapeutic targets, the interface between interacting proteins may not always be amenable to highly specific small molecule blockade. In contrast, peptides are well-suited to this purpose and can be reliably delivered when fused to cell-permeable peptide domains. Therapeutic peptides can be designed to directly target APL fusion proteins, their downstream effectors, or other potentially synergistic oncogenic mechanisms of importance in APL blasts.

These include, among others, improvements in early death rate, the role of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and maintenance treatment, and, finally, optimization of molecular monitoring to better identify patients at increased risk of relapse. The current consensus on the most appropriate induction therapy consists of the concomitant administration of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Although the antileukemic benefit provided by the addition of ATRA to consolidation therapy has not been demonstrated in randomized studies, historical comparisons of consecutive studies carried out by Spanish and Italian cooperative groups suggest that the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy for consolidation may also contribute to improving therapeutic results. While a variety of distinct treatments are being investigated for front-line therapy, most experts agree that a risk-adapted therapy represents the optimal approach, through the use of more intensive therapy in patients with initial hyperleukocytosis. Longitudinal RT-PCR of PML/RARalpha allows sensitive assessment of response to treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in APL. Achievement of negative PCR status or molecular remission at the end of consolidation is now universally accepted and recommended as a therapeutic objective in this disease. On the other hand, persistence of, or conversion to, PCR positive in the marrow during follow-up is associated with impending relapse. Preliminary studies on therapy of molecular relapse indicate a survival advantage as compared to administering salvage treatment at time of hematologic relapse. The more accurate and reproducible real-time PCR method to detect at quantitative levels the PML/RARalpha hybrid will likely provide better inter-laboratory standardization and trial results comparison in the near future.","['Lo-Coco, F', 'Ammatuna, E']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Ammatuna E']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Diagnostica per Immagini, Universita Tor Vergata via Montpellier, 1-00133 Rome, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2007;313:145-56. doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_9.,,,,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of ATRA and conventional anthracycline-ARA-C chemotherapy (CT) has clearly demonstrated its superiority over CT alone (in terms of relapse and survival) in newly diagnosed APL. Combination treatment probably also reduces the incidence of initial failures, and complete remission (CR) rates greater than 90% are now regularly reported in large multicenter trials. Some randomized studies strongly suggest that prolonged maintenance treatment (for 1 or 2 years) with ATRA and low-dose CT, and possibly very early introduction of anthracycline CT during induction treatment, may reduce the incidence of relapse. With those treatments, the relapse risk appears to be only 10%-15%, although it remains greater in patients who initially have high white blood cell counts (often associated with variant M3 morphology, short bcr3 isoform, etc.) and patients with residual disease detectable by RT-PCR at the end of consolidation courses. In those patients, addition of arsenic derivatives to induction or consolidation treatment (or both treatments together) may prove useful and is currently being tested. ATRA syndrome (now generally called APL differentiation syndrome, as it is also seen with arsenic derivatives) remains the major side effect of ATRA treatment. It occurs in 10%-15% of patients and is currently fatal in at least 10% of them. Rapid onset of CT or high dose steroids (or both) should improve its outcome. A sizeable proportion of APL patients who relapse after ATRA and CT can be durably salvaged by the same treatment followed by allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation, provided the transplant (in the autologous setting) is RT-PCR-negative. However, in relapsing APL arsenic derivatives (mainly arsenic trioxide) are now considered to be the reference treatment. Some of the current issues with ATRA treatment in newly diagnosed APL include whether ATRA has a role during consolidation treatment and whether arabinoside (AraC) is required in addition to anthracyclines in the chemotherapy combined to ATRA.","['Fenaux, P', 'Wang, Z Z', 'Degos, L']","['Fenaux P', 'Wang ZZ', 'Degos L']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Avicenne, Paris 13 University, 93000 Bobigny, France. pierre.fenaux@avc.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2007;313:101-28. doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_7.,,,,,,,132,,,,,,,,,,,

These transcription factors have been found mutated or altered by chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias, indicating their role in the pathogenesis of these malignancies. The post-genomic era, however, has shown that transcription factors are not the only key regulators of gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, posttranslational modifications of histones, remodeling of nucleosomes, and expression of small regulatory RNAs all contribute to the regulation of gene expression and determination of cell and tissue specificity. Deregulation ofthese epigenetic mechanisms cooperates with genetic alterations to the establishment and progression of tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of the expression of genes involved in development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Their expression appears to be tissue-specific and highly regulated according to the cell's developmental lineage and stage. Interestingly, miRNAs expressed in hematopoietic cells have been found mutated or altered by chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias. The expression levels of a specific miR-223 correlate with the differentiation fate of myeloid precursors. The activation of both pathways of transcriptional regulation by the myeloid lineage-specific transcription factor C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha), and posttranscriptional regulation by miR-223 appears essential for granulocytic differentiation and clinical response of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Together, this evidence underlies transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, and miRNAs as ultimate determinants for the correct organization of cell type-specific gene arrays and hematopoietic differentiation, therefore providing new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemias.","['Nervi, C', 'Fazi, F', 'Rosa, A', 'Fatica, A', 'Bozzoni, I']","['Nervi C', 'Fazi F', 'Rosa A', 'Fatica A', 'Bozzoni I']","['Department of Histology and Medical Embryology, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" and San Raffaele Bio-medical Park Foundation, Via di Castel Romano 100, 00128 Rome, Italy. clara.nervi@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'NFI Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2007/01/16 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2007/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2007;313:73-84. doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-34594-7_5.,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,

The period of the study was divided into 3 stages according to treatment (initial, during and at the end of the 6 months period). The patients were subjected to nutrition assessment through using 24 hours dietary recall and anthropometric measurements. Also the relationship between nutrient intake and socioeconomic status of the patients was studied. The results showed positive between each of triceps skinfold (TSF), arm circumference (AC), arm muscle circumference (AMC), height (Ht) and weight categories (as a percent of ideal body weight). These parameters can be used to assess nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients throughout the stages of treatment. The results of the 24 hours dietary recall showed a decrease in protein and caloric intake of all the patients by the end of the 6 months period. All the patients had low intake of vitamins A and C and calcium. A positive correlation was found between the intake of these 3 nutrients and socioeconomic level of the patients.","['Abdel-Kader, M K', 'Hemeda, H M', 'Abdel-Hadi, S', 'Rihan, Z el-B', 'El-Adgham, N W']","['Abdel-Kader MK', 'Hemeda HM', 'Abdel-Hadi S', 'Rihan Zel-B', 'El-Adgham NW']","['Food Science and Nutrition Dept., Faculty of Home Economics, Helwan University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Egypt Public Health Assoc,The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,7505602,,IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diet Records', 'Energy Intake/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Mental Recall', '*Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status/*physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'Social Class', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1996/01/01 00:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Public Health Assoc. 1996;71(1-2):161-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epidemiology of childhood cancer is not fully understood. The descriptive epidemiology for cancer incidence has been a subject of considerable debate in order to identify and clarify the role of etiological factors and environmental exposure in cancer. An up-to-date perspective systematically collected data on the incidence of childhood cancer in Alexandria was used. Statistical analysis revealed that the over all cancer incidence rate increased from 1972 to 2001. The incidence of lymphatic and haemopoietic cancers increased dramatically over the specified period. The lymphatic and haemopoietic ancer incidence in 2001 have increased approximately 11 times cancer incidence in 1972. The incidence of leukemia among infant less than 5 years increased exponentially with a higher incidence among boys. Little increase was observed in the cancers of oral cavity, digestive organs and respiratory system over the specified period. Incidence of genito-urinary cancers have increased 3.7 times cancer incidence in 1973. Brain and central nervous system cancers showed an increase of 4.5 fold during the 30 years studied period. The trends in some cancer types suggest the need of a closer examination of the underlying factors and environmental contaminants leading to the disease in children.","['Hosny, Gihan', 'Elkaffas, Saleh M']","['Hosny G', 'Elkaffas SM']","['Environmental Health and Molecular Carcinogenesis Division, Department of Environmental Studies, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt.

It plays an essential role in immune cell differentiation and apoptosis. A haplotype of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PADI4 is functionally relevant as a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) gene. It could increase enzyme activity leading to raised levels of citrullinated protein and stimulating autoantibody. Previously, our study showed that inducible PADI4 causes haematopoietic cell death. Herein, we further investigate whether RA risk PADI4 haplotype (SNP PADI4; S55G, A82V and A112G) and the increase of its enzymatic activity induce apoptosis. In the tetracycline (Tet)-On Jurkat T cells, ionomycin (Ion) only treatment didn't induce apoptosis however it promoted inducible PADI4-decreased cell viability and -enhanced apoptosis. Through in vitro and in vivo PADI enzyme activity assay, we demonstrated that PADI4 enzyme activity of SNP PADI4 was higher than RA non-risk PADI4 haplotype (WT PADI4). The effect of SNP PADI4-induced apoptosis was superior to WT PADI4. In addition, both Ion and SNP PADI4 synergistically provoked apoptosis were compared with both Ion and WT PADI4. Concurrently, in the conditionally inducible SNP PADI4 cells of Ion treatment-induced apoptosis, not only the expression of Bcl-xL was down-regulated and Bax up-regulated, but also cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytoplasm in significant amounts. Western blotting data showed the increase in apoptosomal caspase activation during programmed cell death in the inducible SNP PADI4 cells subsequent to Ion treatment. These data demonstrated that both SNP PADI4 increasing their enzyme activity could enhance apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and further provide a conceivable explanation in the pathogenesis of RA following the upregulation of PADI4 activity in its SNPs.","['Hung, Hui-Chih', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Liao, Ya-Fan', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Tsay, Gregory J', 'Liu, Guang-Yaw']","['Hung HC', 'Lin CY', 'Liao YF', 'Hsu PC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Liu GY']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung-Hsing University, No. 250, Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. hchung@dragon.nchu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (PADI4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Arthritis, Rheumatoid/enzymology/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminases']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2006/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0005-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Mar;12(3):475-87. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0005-0.

We explored the possibility that ascertainment bias influences cancer detection in families, bearing upon the time interval between diagnosis of affected mothers and offspring. METHODS: The Jerusalem Perinatal Study (JPS) comprises all mothers (n = 39,734) from Western Jerusalem who gave birth 1964 -1976 and their offspring (n = 88,829). After linking identification numbers with Israel's Cancer Registry we measured the absolute time interval between initial cancer diagnoses in affected mother-offspring pairs. We tested the probability of obtaining intervals as short as those observed by chance alone, using a permutation test on the median interval. RESULTS: By June 2003 cancer had developed in 105 mother-offspring pairs within the cohort. Common sites among mothers were breast (47%), colorectal (9%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (8%) and cervix (7%), while for offspring in affected pairs common cancers were leukemia (12.4%), thyroid (13.3%), NHL (10.5%), breast (10.5%) and melanoma (7.6%). The median interval between diagnoses was 5.9 years, but for 33% of affected pairs the interval was < or =3 years. The probability of this occurring by chance alone was 0.03. This held true whether the offspring's or mother's diagnosis was first (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based cohort followed for three decades, the absolute interval between the diagnosis of cancer in mothers and their offspring is shorter than expected by chance. Explanations include shared environmental exposures or the possibility that cancer ascertainment in one pair member affects health behaviors in the other resulting in early diagnosis. The latter may bias the estimation of anticipation and survival in familial cancers.","['Paltiel, Ora', 'Friedlander, Yehiel', 'Deutsch, Lisa', 'Yanetz, Rebecca', 'Calderon-Margalit, Ronit', 'Tiram, Efrat', 'Hochner, Hagit', 'Barchana, Micha', 'Harlap, Susan', 'Manor, Orly']","['Paltiel O', 'Friedlander Y', 'Deutsch L', 'Yanetz R', 'Calderon-Margalit R', 'Tiram E', 'Hochner H', 'Barchana M', 'Harlap S', 'Manor O']","['Braun School of Public Health, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel. ora@vms.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,,IM,"['*Adult Children', 'Age of Onset', 'Anticipation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Mothers/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Population Groups/*genetics', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Research Design', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Time Factors']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10689-006-9113-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2007;6(1):121-9. doi: 10.1007/s10689-006-9113-9.,['R01-CA-80197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells were treated with different doses of ATO for 24 h prior to cytogenetic assessment. Data obtained from the MTT assay indicated that ATO significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, showing a LD(50) value of 6.4 +/- 0.6 microg/mL. Data generated from the comet assay also indicated a significant dose-dependent increase in DNA damage in HL-60 cells associated with ATO exposure. We observed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in comet tail-length, tail arm and tail moment, as well as in percentages of DNA cleavage at all doses tested, showing an evidence of ATO-induced genotoxic damage in HL-60 cells. This study confirms that the comet assay is a sensitive and effective method to detect DNA damage caused by heavy metals like arsenic. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATO exposure significantly (P < 0.05) reduces cellular viability and induces DNA damage in HL-60 cells as assessed by MTT and alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assays, respectively.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents/metabolism', '*Comet Assay', '*HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oxides/metabolism/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Silver Staining', 'Tetrazolium Salts/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*metabolism']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/10/03 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2006/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-006-9403-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2007 Jul;301(1-2):123-30. doi: 10.1007/s11010-006-9403-4.

In MDS, the predictive value of the two markers differed substantially from one another: beta2M was associated with survival, CR and CRD, whereas sHLA-I was not. These findings not only establish the role of sHLA-I as a tumor marker in AML but also support that MDS is clinically and biologically distinct from AML. sHLA-I has been reported to be an immunomodulator inhibiting the cytotoxic effects of T-lymphocytes, which may offset its predictive value for disease aggressiveness in patients with MDS.","['Albitar, M', 'Johnson, M', 'Do, K A', 'Day, A', 'Jilani, I', 'Pierce, S', 'Estey, E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M', 'Verstovsek, S', ""O'brien, S"", 'Giles, F J']","['Albitar M', 'Johnson M', 'Do KA', 'Day A', 'Jilani I', 'Pierce S', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Verstovsek S', ""O'brien S"", 'Giles FJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690, USA. maher.x.albitar@questdiagnostics.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*blood', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Solubility', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*blood']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404506 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404506 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):480-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404506.

We performed a cross-sectional study in which we enumerated and characterized CD4(+)CD25(high) T(regs) in the peripheral blood of CML patients undergoing allogeneic SCT. We documented higher frequencies of T(regs) in patients after transplant as compared to normal controls and newly diagnosed patients. The increment was particularly evident in patients who had received their SCT 18 months before. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that the T(regs) purified from SCT patients exhibited a more potent suppressive activity than T(regs) isolated from healthy volunteers. Patients in whom T(regs) numbers were higher than controls more than 18 months after SCT showed evidence of disease relapse. Although the increment in T(regs) might have an advantageous effect on graft rejection in the early phase post-transplant, our data suggest that T(regs) exert an inhibitory effect on GvL.","['Nadal, E', 'Garin, M', 'Kaeda, J', 'Apperley, J', 'Lechler, R', 'Dazzi, F']","['Nadal E', 'Garin M', 'Kaeda J', 'Apperley J', 'Lechler R', 'Dazzi F']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/immunology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404522 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404522 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):472-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404522.

There is strong evidence that activation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling network plays a significant role in rendering AML blasts drug resistant. An important mechanism underlying drug resistance is represented by overexpression of membrane drug transporters such as multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) or 170-kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, we present evidence that MRP1, but not P-gp, expression is under the control of the PI3K/Akt axis in AML blasts. We observed a highly significant correlation between levels of phosphorylated Akt and MRP1 expression in AML cells. Furthermore, incubation of AML blasts with wortmannin, a PI3K pharmacological inhibitor, resulted in lower levels of phosphorylated Akt, downregulated MRP1 expression, and decreased Rhodamine 123 extrusion in an in vitro functional dye efflux assay. We also demonstrate that wortmannin-dependent PI3K/Akt inhibition upregulated p53 protein levels in most AML cases, and this correlated with diminished MRP1 expression and enhanced phosphorylation of murine double minute 2 (MDM2). Taken together, these data suggest that PI3K/Akt activation may lead to the development of chemoresistance in AML blasts through a mechanism involving a p53-dependent suppression of MRP1 expression.","['Tazzari, P L', 'Cappellini, A', 'Ricci, F', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Papa, V', 'Grafone, T', 'Martinelli, G', 'Conte, R', 'Cocco, L', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Tazzari PL', 'Cappellini A', 'Ricci F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Papa V', 'Grafone T', 'Martinelli G', 'Conte R', 'Cocco L', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Servizio di Immunoematologia e Trasfusionale, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Wortmannin']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404523 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404523 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):427-38. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404523.

The model has 2 components: an ideal data model describing the distribution of the quantity of interest and a coarsening mechanism that describes a distribution over degrees of coarsening given the ideal data. The coarsening mechanism is said to be nonignorable when the degree of coarsening depends on an incompletely observed ideal outcome, in which case failure to properly account for it can spoil inferences. A theme in recent research is to measure sensitivity to nonignorability by evaluating the effect of a small departure from ignorability on the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of a parameter of the ideal data model. One such construct is the ""index of local sensitivity to nonignorability"" (ISNI) (Troxel and others, 2004), which is the derivative of the MLE with respect to a nonignorability parameter evaluated at the ignorable model. In this paper, we adapt ISNI to Bayesian modeling by instead defining it as the derivative of the posterior expectation. We propose the application of ISNI as a first step in judging the robustness of a Bayesian analysis to nonignorable coarsening. We derive formulas for a range of models and apply the method to evaluate sensitivity to nonignorable coarsening in 2 real data examples, one involving missing CD4 counts in an HIV trial and the other involving potentially informatively censored relapse times in a leukemia trial.","['Zhang, Jiameng', 'Heitjan, Daniel F']","['Zhang J', 'Heitjan DF']","['Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. zhang.jiameng@gene.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,,IM,"['*Bayes Theorem', '*Biometry', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/12 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['kxm001 [pii]', '10.1093/biostatistics/kxm001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biostatistics. 2007 Oct;8(4):722-43. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxm001.

In part, this may reflect better differentiation of idiopathic and inherited marrow failure. For children with idiopathic AA and a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD), allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT) is the primary therapy of choice, offering long-term disease-free survival of 90%, although graft-versus-host disease remains a cause of long-term morbidity. A greater treatment challenge remains for those children without a MSD. Combination immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is associated with response rates of 70% or more. However, relapse and clonal evolution with transformation to myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia remain significant problems after IST and long-term event-free survival rates are less impressive. For children who do not have a sustained response to IST, alternate donor AHSCT should be considered. New HLA typing technologies, novel stem cell sources, reduced-intensity conditioning and graft engineering have reduced toxicity and improved the outcome after alternate donor AHSCT. Emerging therapies that capitalise on recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of idiopathic AA and the immunobiology of AHSCT and IST may further improve the long-term outcome of this disease.","['Davies, Jeffrey K', 'Guinan, Eva C']","['Davies JK', 'Guinan EC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6461 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06461.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(4):549-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06461.x.,,,,,,,114,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case in a 27-year-old man with leukocytosis (10.6 x 10(3)/microL with 34% blasts), thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. Marrow aspiration showed 47% blasts and 33% eosinophils, of which 19% were morphologically abnormal with both eosinophilic and basophilic cytoplasmic granules. Cytochemically, the blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase while the granules of abnormal eosinophils were positive for naphthol ASD chloroacetate esterase.

The source of the autoantibodies is still uncertain: either uncontrolled production of the malignant B cells or disturbances of the residual normal B and T cells involved in the immune system. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate immunologic parameters in B-CLL associated with autoimmune disorders. As a hypothesis we postulated that in those cases, the malignant B cells might disclose an activated phenotype pattern leading to the production of autoantibodies. METHODS: In the Registry of the Israel Study Group on CLL that includes 964 patients, we found 115 cases showing a single or a complex of autoimmune disorders. We evaluated the lymphocyte morphology, immunoglobulin G and beta-2-microglobulin serum levels and positivity of the CD38 and FMC7 markers, and compared these values with those of a matched CLL population without autoimmune disorder. RESULTS: The main autoimmune disorders encountered were autoimmune hemolytic anemia (55 patients), Evan's syndrome (n=7), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n=15), vasculitis (n=5) and rheumatoid arthritis (n=4). We found atypical prolymphocytic morphology in 22%, high expression of the activation antigens CD38 and/or FMC7 in 30%, and high level of immunoglobulin G (> 1000 mg/dl) and beta-2-microglobulin in 57% and 78% respectively. When compared with a matched CLL population without an autoimmune disorder, these values were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, which show activated lymphocyte morphology, high levels of IgG and beta-2-microglobulin, and increased expression of CD38 and/or FMC7 in a significant number of cases, suggest that some degree of activation of B cells may lead to the occurrence of an autoimmune disorder in CLL.","['Duek, Adrian', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Braester, Andre', 'Berrebi, Alain']","['Duek A', 'Shvidel L', 'Braester A', 'Berrebi A']","['Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr Med Assoc J,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100930740,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoantibodies/genetics/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Registries', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/immunology']",2007/01/12 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr Med Assoc J. 2006 Dec;8(12):828-31.,,,,['Isr Med Assoc J. 2006 Dec;8(12):864.

It provides numbers of HSCT by indication, donor type and stem cell source, lists the new practice of planned double transplants with allogeneic after autologous HSCT and concentrates on the increasing role of unrelated transplants over the last years. In 2005, there were 24,168 first HSCT, 8890 allogeneic (37%), 15,278 autologous (63%) and 3773 additional re- or multiple transplants reported from 597 centres in 43 participating countries. Main indications were leukaemias (7404 (31%; 82% allogeneic)); lymphomas (13,825 (57%; 89% autologous)); solid tumours (1655 (7%; 92% autologous)) and non-malignant disorders (1131 (5%; 93% allogeneic)). A total of 671 planned allogeneic after autologous HSCT were reported; the majority for myeloma (52%), lymphoma (28%) and acute myeloid leukaemia (11%). Compared to 2004, there was a 20% increase in allogeneic HSCT; numbers of autologous HSCT remained constant.

We analysed 31,713 consecutive paediatric HSCTs reported by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centres between 1970 and 2002. Data were taken from the EBMT registry and were compared according to period and centre category (paediatric or combined). Since 1996, there has been a significant increase in the number of HSCTs performed exclusively by paediatric centres, as well as in the number of alternative donor HSCTs, and in the use of peripheral blood stem cells (P<0.0001). The number of allogeneic HSCTs (allo-HSCTs) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia remained stable, whereas it increased for myelodysplastic syndromes and lymphomas, and decreased significantly for non-malignant diseases (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, human leukocyte antigen genoidentical donors, HSCT performed after 1996 and transplant centres performing more than 10 allo-HSCT/year were all associated with decreased transplant-related mortality (TRM) (P<0.0001). The number of autologus HSCTs (auto-HSCTs) for acute leukaemia decreased significantly, whereas it increased for solid tumours (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that both auto-HSCT performed before 1996 and paediatric solid tumours (P<0.0001) had higher TRM. Indications for paediatric HSCT have changed considerably during the last seven years. These changes provide tools for decision making in health-care planning and counselling.","['Miano, M', 'Labopin, M', 'Hartmann, O', 'Angelucci, E', 'Cornish, J', 'Gluckman, E', 'Locatelli, F', 'Fischer, A', 'Egeler, R M', 'Or, R', 'Peters, C', 'Ortega, J', 'Veys, P', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Iori, A P', 'Niethammer, D', 'Rocha, V', 'Dini, G']","['Miano M', 'Labopin M', 'Hartmann O', 'Angelucci E', 'Cornish J', 'Gluckman E', 'Locatelli F', 'Fischer A', 'Egeler RM', 'Or R', 'Peters C', 'Ortega J', 'Veys P', 'Bordigoni P', 'Iori AP', 'Niethammer D', 'Rocha V', 'Dini G']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, IRCSS Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Data Collection', 'Europe', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Registries', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705550 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705550 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jan;39(2):89-99. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705550.,,,,,,,,,"['Paediatric Diseases Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation']",,,,,,,,,

From a clinical standpoint, dasatinib is particularly attractive because it has been shown to induce hematologic and cytogenetic responses in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The fact because the combination of imatinib and dasatinib shows the additive/synergistic growth inhibition on wild-type p210 BCR-ABL-expressing cells, we reasoned that these ABL kinase inhibitors might induce the different molecular pathways. To address this question, we used DNA microarrays to identify genes whose transcription was altered by imatinib and dasatinib. K562 cells were cultured with imatinib or dasatinib for 16 h, and gene expression data were obtained from three independent microarray hybridizations. Almost all of the imatinib- and dasatinib-responsive genes appeared to be similarly increased or decreased in K562 cells; however, small subsets of genes were identified as selectively altered expression by either imatinib or dasatinib. The distinct genes that are selectively modulated by dasatinib are cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK8, which had a maximal reduction of <5-fold in microarray screen. To assess the functional importance of dasatinib regulated genes, we used RNA interference to determine whether reduction of CDK2 and CDK8 affected the growth inhibition. K562 and TF-1BCR-ABL cells, pretreated with CDK2 or CDK8 small interfering RNA, showed additive growth inhibition with imatinib, but not with dasatinib. These findings demonstrate that the additive/synergistic growth inhibition by imatinib and dasatinib may be mediated in part by CDK2 and CDK8.","['Nunoda, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Takaku, T', 'Okabe, S', 'Akahane, D', 'Sashida, G', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Nunoda K', 'Tauchi T', 'Takaku T', 'Okabe S', 'Akahane D', 'Sashida G', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Oncogenes', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210179 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210179 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jun 14;26(28):4179-88. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210179.

Here, we show that the combination of conventional chemotherapeutic agents (daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, 5-azacytidine or camptothecin) with the NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082 did not yield a synergistic cytotoxicity. In contrast, BAY11-7082 (which targets the NF-kappaB-activating I-kappaB kinase (IKK) complex) or knockdown of essential components of the NF-kappaB system (such as the IKK1 and IKK2 subunits of the IKK complex and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB), by small interfering RNAs sensitized MDS cell lines to starvation-induced apoptosis. The combination of BAY11-7082 and nutrient depletion synergistically killed the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line U937 as well as primary CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from AML and high-risk MDS patients. The synergistic killing by BAY11-7082, combined with nutrient depletion, led to cell death accompanied by all hallmarks of apoptosis, including an early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane surface and nuclear chromatin condensation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of numerous autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm before cells underwent nuclear apoptosis. Nonetheless, cell death was neither inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk nor by knockdown of AIF or of essential components of the autophagy pathway (ATG5, ATG6/Beclin-1, ATG10, ATG12). In contrast, external supply of glucose, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I could retard the cell death induced by BAY11-7082 combined with starvation. These results suggest that in MDS cells, NF-kappaB inhibition can precipitate a bioenergetic crisis that leads to an autophagic stress response followed by apoptotic cell death.","['Fabre, C', 'Carvalho, G', 'Tasdemir, E', 'Braun, T', 'Ades, L', 'Grosjean, J', 'Boehrer, S', 'Metivier, D', 'Souquere, S', 'Pierron, G', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Fabre C', 'Carvalho G', 'Tasdemir E', 'Braun T', 'Ades L', 'Grosjean J', 'Boehrer S', 'Metivier D', 'Souquere S', 'Pierron G', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, Unit Apoptosis, Cancer and Immunity, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Cell Death', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfones/*therapeutic use']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210187 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210187 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jun 14;26(28):4071-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210187.

METHODS: The study population was a cohort of 30 patients (aged 14.1+/-2.9 years; 20 male) treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood and then examined after insulin-induced hypoglycemia (30 patients) and clonidine (16 patients) tests. The follow-up time was 7.7+/-2.8 years since treatment and 2.3+/-1.3 years after administration of the tests. RESULTS: In the last evaluation, 12 patients (40%) were below and 18 (60%) were above percentile 10. The insulin-induced hypoglycemia test response was: 9 patients (30%) had growth hormone peak <5 ng/mL and 19 (63.3%) <7 ng/mL. The clonidine test response was: 7 patients had growth hormone peak <5 ng/mL and 8 (50%) <7 ng/mL. For stature below of the percentile 10, the positive predictive values of insulin-induced hypoglycemia test (33%) and clonidine (28%) were low when growth hormone peak <5 ng/mL was considered; however, when growth hormone peak <7 ng/mL was considered, the positive predictive values were 83% and 50% for the insulin-induced hypoglycemia and clonidine tests, respectively.

RESULTS: The growth of K562 cells was inhibited after the treatment with H42648 for 5 days. The inhibition rates for K562 cells in MTT assay were (26.90+/-3.18)% and (43.26+/-2.54)% after the treatment by 10(-8)mol/L and 10(-6)mol/L H42648.

However, in primary CD34(+) CML cells, nilotinib and IM were equipotent for inhibition of BcrAbl activity, producing equivalent but incomplete reduction in CrkL phosphorylation at 5 microM. CML CD34(+) cells were still able to expand over 72 hours with 5 microM of either drug, although there was a concentration-dependent restriction of amplification. As for IM, the most primitive cells (CFSE(max)) persisted and accumulated over 72 hours with nilotinib and remained caspase-3 negative.

Graft-vs-leukaemia (GVL) effect is a beneficial T-cell-mediated immune response that can also occur following HLA-matched HSCT. mHAs with tissue expression restricted to cells of the haematopoietic system are particularly relevant as immunotherapeutic targets for destroying malignant cells without inducing GVHD. Therefore, it is important to identify further haematopoietic-restricted polymorphic mHAs, which may have the potential to be used clinically for adoptive immunotherapy. Polymorphic mismatching of minor antigens, such as the B-cell-specific protein, the kappa immunoglobulin light chain (kappa) may play a role in the incidence of GVL and therefore the survival of transplant recipients following transplantation for B-cell malignancies. Polymorphisms in the constant region of the immunoglobulin kappa polypeptide chain have been defined involving single amino acid changes at positions 153 and 191. In this study, 51 HLA-matched B-cell malignancy transplant pairs were kappa typed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion to investigate the association between kappa allotype disparity and outcome after transplantation. Kappa allotype disparity between transplant pairs may be associated with an increased survival compared with pairs not mismatched for kappa, as kappa mismatched recipients had a higher percentage of complete remissions and a decreased level of relapse in comparison with the nonmismatched recipients. HLA peptide prediction software was used to determine which HLA types were the best binders for kappa peptides. It was observed that patients with tissue types predicted to bind the kappa Km(1,2) peptides had better survival outcomes and no relapse compared with those with tissue types not predicted to bind the kappa Km(1,2) peptides.

In this study, we examine the potential of FTIR microspectroscopy for early evaluation of therapy efficiency. For this purpose, we examine the effect of acyclovir (a known antiherpetic drug) on the development of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in cell culture. Also, we examine spectral changes in lymphocytes obtained from leukemia patients after appropriate chemotherapy treatment. Our results show early and significant spectral indicators for successful infection of Vero cells with HSV-1. Treatment of these infected cells with increasing doses of acyclovir reduces clearly the spectral changes caused by the infection in a correlation with inhibiting the development of the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by this virus. Also significant and consistent spectral differences between lymphocytes from human leukemia patients compared to that from healthy persons are obtained. Treatment of these leukemia patients with appropriate drugs reduces significantly these spectral differences in a correlation with the improvement of the patient's clinical situation.

We have modelled the previously uncharacterized core domain (SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase) and C-terminal actin-binding domain of ARG. We have also investigated the structural arrangement of the ABL and ARG Cap region and of the long multifunctional region located downstream of the tyrosine kinase domain. We report that the ARG core domain is homologous to the corresponding ABL region, therefore suggesting that ARG catalytic activity is likely regulated by the same SH3-SH2 clamp described for ABL. We also report that the Cap of both ABL and ARG is natively unfolded. Hence, biological events determining the folding of the Cap are critical to allow its interaction with the tyrosine kinase C-lobe. Furthermore, our results show that, with the exception of the C-terminal actin-binding domain, the entire region encoded by the ABL and ARG last exon is natively unfolded. Phosphorylation events or protein-protein interactions regulating the folding of this region will therefore modulate the activity of its numerous functional domains. Finally, our analyses show that the C-terminal actin-binding domain of ARG displays a four-helix bundle structure similar to the one reported for the corresponding ABL region. Our findings imply that many biological activities attributed to ABL, ARG, and their oncogenic counterparts are regulated by natively unfolded regions.","['Buffa, Pietro', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Messina, Angelo', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Buffa P', 'Manzella L', 'Consoli ML', 'Messina A', 'Vigneri P']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Section of General Pathology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Folding', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'src Homology Domains/physiology']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/prot.21161 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2007 Apr 1;67(1):1-11. doi: 10.1002/prot.21161.,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to define potential mutation-specific therapeutic targets, stable transfectants of NIH3T3 cells carrying different Ki-ras4B gene mutations were generated. Wild type Ki-ras transformants, mock transfectants and parental cells served as controls. These in vitro model systems were systematically analyzed for their protein expression pattern using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry and/or protein sequencing. Using this approach, a number of target molecules that are differentially but coordinately expressed in the ras transfectants were identified next to other proteins that exhibit a distinct regulation pattern in the different cell lines analyzed. The differentially expressed proteins predominantly belong to the families of cytoskeletal proteins, heat shock proteins, annexins, metabolic enzymes and oxidoreductases. Their validation was assessed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Our results suggest that the Ki-ras-transformed cells represent a powerful tool to study Ki-ras gene mutation-driven protein expression profiles.

Classical staging systems and laboratory features help predict survival in CLL, but they do not distinguish patients who will progress from those whose disease will remain indolent. In recent years, new molecular prognostic factors have emerged that have significantly improved prediction of the risk for disease progression. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes (VH) is one of the major molecular prognostic factors. In this study we evaluated the association between the immunoglobulin VH gene mutation status and the clinical characteristics and outcome in 65 CLL patients that had been followed for a considerably long period at our institution. At diagnosis, patients with unmutated VH genes had higher median lymphocyte counts (P=0.001), higher total tumor mass score (P=0.001) and more often presented at an advance clinical stage (P=0.005) compared to patients utilizing mutated VH genes. Moreover, the median survival of patients with unmutated VH genes was considerably shorter (VH unmutated, 56 months, VH mutated, 125 months; P<0.001). These data confirmed the prognostic value of immunoglobulin VH genes mutational status in CLL, which divides the disease in two prognostic subsets in terms of overall survival and clinical characteristics of the disease. Analysis of the mutational status of the immunoglobulin VH genes may allow for an individualized approach to CLL treatment in the near future.","['Panovska-Stavridis, I', 'Cevreska, L', 'Stojanovic, A', 'Efremov, D']","['Panovska-Stavridis I', 'Cevreska L', 'Stojanovic A', 'Efremov D']","['Department of Hematology, Clinical Centre, Medical Faculty, Ss.

Ghrelin is octanoylated on the Ser(3), but is also detected as a des-acylated form.

For the first time, we report that ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin are present in human promyelocytic HL-60, monocytic THP-1 and lymphoblastic SupT1 cell lines. The human leukemic cell lines did not express the functional GHS-R 1a, whereas they expressed GHS-R 1b, a truncated variant of the receptor. Leukemic cell proliferation was not modified by the addition of octanoylated or des-acyl ghrelins. However, THP-1 and HL-60 cell proliferations were inhibited by SB801, an antibody directed against the N-terminal octanoylated portion of ghrelin, suggesting that octanoylated ghrelin stimulates cell proliferation via an autocrine pathway involving an as yet unidentified ghrelin receptor.

This pattern is inconsistent with observations that DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands is typically associated with gene silencing. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of promoter DNA methylation, chromatin patterns, and expression of hTERT in cancer and immortalized cells. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing of the hTERT promoter in breast, lung, and colon cancer cells show that all cancer cell lines retain alleles with little or no methylation around the transcription start site despite being densely methylated in a region 600 bp upstream of the transcription start site. By real-time reverse transcription-PCR, all cancer cell lines express hTERT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis reveals that both active (acetyl-H3K9 and dimethyl-H3K4) and inactive (trimethyl-H3K9 and trimethyl-H3K27) chromatin marks are present across the hTERT promoter. However, using a novel approach combining methylation analysis of ChIP DNA, we show that active chromatin marks are associated with unmethylated DNA, whereas inactive marks of chromatin are associated with methylated DNA in the region around the transcription start site. These results show that DNA methylation patterns of the hTERT promoter (-150 to +150 around the transcription start) are consistent with the usual dynamics of gene expression in that the absence of methylation in this region and the association with active chromatin marks allow for the continued expression of hTERT.","['Zinn, Rebekah L', 'Pruitt, Kevin', 'Eguchi, Sayaka', 'Baylin, Stephen B', 'Herman, James G']","['Zinn RL', 'Pruitt K', 'Eguchi S', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcription Initiation Site']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/1/194 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3396 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 1;67(1):194-201. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3396.,"['CA 088843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 11858/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many factors known to play critically important roles in controlling apoptosis and gene transcription have been shown to associate with Daxx, including the Ser/Thr protein kinase HIPK2, promyelocytic leukemia protein, histone deacetylases, and the chromatin remodeling protein ATRX. Although it is clear that Daxx may exert multiple functions, the underlying mechanisms remain far from clear. Here, we show that Axin, originally identified for its scaffolding role to control beta-catenin levels in Wnt signaling, strongly associates with Daxx at endogenous levels. The Daxx/Axin complex formation is enhanced by UV irradiation. Axin tethers Daxx to the tumor suppressor p53, and cooperates with Daxx, but not DaxxDeltaAxin, which is unable to interact with Axin, to stimulate HIPK2-mediated Ser(46) phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of p53. Interestingly, Axin and Daxx seem to selectively activate p53 target genes, with strong activation of PUMA, but not p21 or Bax. Daxx-stimulated p53 transcriptional activity was significantly diminished by small interfering RNA against Axin; Daxx fails to inhibit colony formation in Axin(-/-) cells. Moreover, UV-induced cell death was attenuated by the knockdown of Axin and Daxx. All these results show that Daxx cooperates with Axin to stimulate p53, and implicate a direct role for Axin, HIPK2, and p53 in the proapoptotic function of Daxx. We have hence unraveled a novel aspect of p53 activation and shed new light on the ultimate understanding of the Daxx protein, perhaps most pertinently, in relation to stress-induced cell death.","['Li, Qinxi', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Wu, Xiaoling', 'Rui, Yanning', 'Liu, Wei', 'Wang, Jifeng', 'Wang, Xinghao', 'Liou, Yih-Cherng', 'Ye, Zhiyun', 'Lin, Sheng-Cai']","['Li Q', 'Wang X', 'Wu X', 'Rui Y', 'Liu W', 'Wang J', 'Wang X', 'Liou YC', 'Ye Z', 'Lin SC']","['Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Cell Biology and Tumor Cell Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361005, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Axin Protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Axin Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/1/66 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1671 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 1;67(1):66-74. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1671.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the adult kidney, expression of both transcripts is restricted to the paternal allele, with the silent maternal allele retaining methylation at the WT1 antisense regulatory region (WT1 ARR). Here, we report characterization of the WT1 ARR differentially methylated region and show that it contains a transcriptional silencer element acting on both the AWT1 and WT1-AS promoters. DNA methylation of the silencer results in increased transcriptional repression, and the silencer is also shown to be an in vitro and in vivo target site for the imprinting regulator protein CTCF. Binding of CTCF is methylation-sensitive and limited to the unmethylated silencer. Potentiation of the silencer activity is demonstrated after CTCF protein is knocked down, suggesting a novel silencer-blocking activity for CTCF. We also report assessment of WT1 ARR methylation in developmental and tumour tissues, including the first analysis of Wilms' tumour precursor lesions, nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests show increases in methylation levels relative to foetal kidney and reductions relative to the adult kidney, together with biallelic expression of AWT1 and WT1-AS. Notably, the methylation status of CpG residues within the CTCF target site appears to distinguish monoallelic and biallelic expression states. Our data suggest that failure of methylation spreading at the WT1 ARR early in renal development, followed by imprint erasure, occurs during Wilms' tumourigenesis. We propose a model wherein imprinting defects at chromosome 11p13 may contribute to Wilms' tumourigenesis.","['Hancock, Anne L', 'Brown, Keith W', 'Moorwood, Kim', 'Moon, Hanlim', 'Holmgren, Claes', 'Mardikar, Sudhanshu H', 'Dallosso, Anthony R', 'Klenova, Elena', 'Loukinov, Dmitri', 'Ohlsson, Rolf', 'Lobanenkov, Victor V', 'Malik, Karim']","['Hancock AL', 'Brown KW', 'Moorwood K', 'Moon H', 'Holmgren C', 'Mardikar SH', 'Dallosso AR', 'Klenova E', 'Loukinov D', 'Ohlsson R', 'Lobanenkov VV', 'Malik K']","['Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood, Sargent Research Unit, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol, University Walk, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Kidney/embryology/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Silencer Elements, Transcriptional/*physiology', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['ddl478 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddl478 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2007 Feb 1;16(3):343-54. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddl478.

Although differentiation was significantly induced in both cell types, SFME cells showed more obvious responses to the cytokine signals. Various concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA) (0.1 pg/ml to 1 microg/ml) were added to determine its effects on cell differentiation. A completely serum-free culture was developed for effective differentiation of G-SFME cells with LIF and BMP2, and GFAP expression was significantly increased in the presence of 1-100 pg/ml BPA. These increases were attributed to excessive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 (Smad1) by the low-level BPA. The data obtained in the present study revealed that the sensitivity of the cells to LIF, BMP2 and BPA could change upon cell differentiation, suggesting that the cells may possibly respond differently to cytokines and endocrine disruptors depending on subtle differences in their differentiation state.","['Yamaguchi, Hideaki', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Yu, Tao', 'Sasaki, Kazuo', 'Umetsu, Hironori', 'Kidachi, Yumi', 'Ryoyama, Kazuo']","['Yamaguchi H', 'Zhu J', 'Yu T', 'Sasaki K', 'Umetsu H', 'Kidachi Y', 'Ryoyama K']","['Graduate School of Environmental Sciences, Aomori University, 2-3-1 Kobata, Aomori 030-0943, Japan. yamaguch@aomori-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'MLT3645I99 (bisphenol A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological/*drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Smad1 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2006/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(06)00291-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.11.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2007 Jun;31(6):638-44. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.11.024.

Bovine LIF (bLIF) has been cloned and used in culture, but there is no commercially available bLIF. Thus, researchers use human LIF (hLIF) to supplement the culture medium for bovine embryos because of its greater sequence homology compared to murine LIF (mLIF). We compared the effects of mLIF and hLIF on the development of bovine embryos in culture with the effects described for bLIF. Oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro and cultured in modified synthetic oviduct fluid with BSA. On Day 6 post-insemination, morulae were cultured for 48h in the presence of: (1) mLIF, 100ngml(-1); (2) hLIF, 100ngml(-1); or (3) no LIF. Reduced blastocyst rates were observed on Day 8 for hLIF at the middle and expanded stages, while mLIF had no effect. In contrast, Day 8 blastocysts showed decreased cell counts both in terms of inner cell mass (ICM) and ICM/total cell proportions in the presence of mLIF, while hLIF had no effect.

The prevalence in the general population is approximately 30/100,000. The median age at diagnosis is 65 to 70 years, but the disease may occur at any age. The female to male ratio is about 2:1. The clinical picture is dominated by a predisposition to vascular occlusive events (involving the cerebrovascular, coronary and peripheral circulation) and hemorrhages. Some patients with ET are asymptomatic, others may experience vasomotor (headaches, visual disturbances, lightheadedness, atypical chest pain, distal paresthesias, erythromelalgia), thrombotic, or hemorrhagic disturbances. Arterial and venous thromboses, as well as platelet-mediated transient occlusions of the microcirculation and bleeding, represent the main risks for ET patients. Thromboses of large arteries represent a major cause of mortality associated with ET or can induce severe neurological, cardiac or peripheral artery manifestations. Acute leukemia or myelodysplasia represent only rare and frequently later-onset events. The molecular pathogenesis of ET, which leads to the overproduction of mature blood cells, is similar to that found in other clonal MPDs such as chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia of the spleen. Polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia of the spleen and ET are generally associated under the common denomination of Philadelphia (Ph)-negative MPDs. Despite the recent identification of the JAK2 V617F mutation in a subset of patients with Ph-negative MPDs, the detailed pathogenetic mechanism is still a matter of discussion. Therapeutic interventions in ET are limited to decisions concerning the introduction of anti-aggregation therapy and/or starting platelet cytoreduction. The therapeutic value of hydroxycarbamide and aspirin in high risk patients has been supported by controlled studies. Avoiding thromboreduction or opting for anagrelide to postpone the long-term side effects of hydrocarbamide in young or low risk patients represent alternative options. Life expectancy is almost normal and similar to that of a healthy population matched by age and sex.","['Briere, Jean B']",['Briere JB'],"[""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hopital Beaujon, Clichy, France. jean.briere@bjn.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematologic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Sex Distribution', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/*therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1750-1172-2-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-1172-2-3 [doi]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2007 Jan 8;2:3. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-2-3.,,PMC1781427,,,,20070108,108,,,,,,,,,,,

As established immunochemical methods in allergen standardization only determine inhibition potency or major allergen content, routine tests for biological potency may enhance standardization and batch control of allergen products. OBJECTIVE: The general performance and application potential of biological in vitro assays in batch control and standardization of allergens and as a tool for verifying activity and stability of allergen standards were analysed. METHODS: Allergen extracts of five clinically relevant allergens from three to five different manufacturers were investigated. A CAP-IgE-inhibition assay was compared with mediator release assay (MRA)s based on murine or human basophils. Rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells were passively sensitized with pooled murine allergen-specific IgE-containing sera. Humanized RBL cells and human-stripped basophils were sensitized with pooled patient's sera, which were also used for the CAP-IgE-inhibition assay. Allergen specificity of the sera was determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: A good batch-to-batch consistency was found with each assay among all manufacturers and allergens tested. Between different manufacturers, the products showed differences in activity and the various assays indicated an almost identical ranking. However, the biological assays revealed qualitative differences of biological activity or composition of allergen preparations undetectable by IgE-inhibition assay. CONCLUSIONS: MRAs provide refined information on allergen activity, either confirming the results of IgE-inhibition assay, or indicating differences requiring further investigation, and represent a highly sensitive novel tool in allergen standardization. By using permanently cultivated cell lines, repeated venepuncture to obtain human basophils is avoided. As in the RBL assay, the coefficient of variation for the release values were below 15% and for the ED50 below 25%, the assay is suitable to determine differences that are relevant for batch control purposes.","['Kaul, S', 'Luttkopf, D', 'Kastner, B', 'Vogel, L', 'Holtz, G', 'Vieths, S', 'Hoffmann, A']","['Kaul S', 'Luttkopf D', 'Kastner B', 'Vogel L', 'Holtz G', 'Vieths S', 'Hoffmann A']","['Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens/*analysis/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Betula', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mice', 'Poaceae', 'Rats', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Reference Standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/01/11 09:00,2007/09/25 09:00,['2007/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEA2618 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02618.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2007 Jan;37(1):141-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02618.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABT-869 (a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) inhibited the phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5, and ERK, as well as Pim-1 expression in MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 cells (IC(50) approximately 1-10 nM) harboring the FLT3-ITD. ABT-869 inhibited the proliferation of these cells (IC(50) = 4 and 6 nM, respectively) through the induction of apoptosis (increased sub-G(0)/G(1) phase, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage), whereas cells harboring wild-type (wt)-FLT3 were less sensitive. In normal human blood spiked with AML cells, ABT-869 inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 (IC(50) approximately 100 nM), STAT5, and ERK, and decreased Pim-1 expression. In methylcellulose-based colony-forming assays, ABT-869 had no significant effect up to 1000 nM on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas in AML patient samples harboring both FLT3-ITD and wt-FLT3, ABT-869 inhibited colony formation (IC(50) = 100 and 1000 nM, respectively). ABT-869 dose-dependently inhibited MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 flank tumor growth, prevented tumor formation, regressed established MV-4-11 xenografts, and increased survival by 20 weeks in an MV-4-11 engraftment model.

Here we update this review, focusing on the risk of hematologic cancers (for example, leukemia and lymphoma) reported in studies of oil refinery workers published in the last ten years. Limitations of recent studies are discussed, including the dilution of highly exposed groups of workers with workers with little or no exposure. We consider the evidence for a ""safe level"" or threshold of benzene exposure in the light of its ability to cause several types of damage, including damage to stem cells which may cause a variety of malignancies. We conclude that there is evidence of a slight increase in mortality from leukemia among oil refinery workers, particularly among those employed before 1950. And continuing exposures to benzene and other carcinogens occurring in this industry should be controlled.","['Clapp, R W', 'Coogan, P F']","['Clapp RW', 'Coogan PF']","['School of Public Health, Boston University, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,New Solut,New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,9100937,,,,2007/01/09 09:00,2007/01/09 09:01,['2007/01/09 09:00'],"['2007/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:01 [medline]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['MEYLUD490YTH56YE [pii]', '10.2190/MEYL-UD49-0YTH-56YE [doi]']",ppublish,New Solut. 1999;9(4):375-87. doi: 10.2190/MEYL-UD49-0YTH-56YE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different molecular descriptors can be used to solve this problem. Stochastic molecular descriptors so-called the MARCH-INSIDE approach, shown to be very successful in drug design. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of compounds is so vast that we may need non-linear models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) instead of linear ones. SmartMLP-ANN analysis used to model the anticancer activity of organic compounds has shown high average accuracy of 93.79% (train performance) and predictability of 90.88% (validation performance) for the 8:3-MLP topology with different training and predicting series. This ANN model favourably compares with respect to a previous linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model [H. Gonzalez-Diaz et al., J. Mol.

Here we have investigated the mechanisms of cell death following chronic exposure of cardiac myocytes to oxidative stress initiated by hydrogen peroxide. This exposure induced a delayed form of cell death with ultrastructural changes typical of necrosis, and that was accompanied by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and increased lipid peroxidation. However, this delayed death was not accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that this delayed necrosis was at least partially prevented by pre-treatment with the hypertrophic stimuli endothelin-1 or leukemic inhibitory factor.

This could be explored as a novel strategy to inhibit multidrug resistance in targeted tumor cells and as a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of certain cancers.

The nature of their cargo, their juxtaposition to foci of damaged DNA following ionizing radiation (IR), and the altered DNA damage responses in PML null cells all implicate PML-NDs in the DNA damage response. In this work, the propensity of PML-NDs to increase in number and decrease in size following IR has been studied. Serial quantitative studies of endogenous PML-NDs prove that the PML-ND response to IR is not the result of the asymmetry in cell cycle distribution that can follow IR, but reflects more directly the process of DNA damage. The response is swift, sensitive (evident after 1 Gy), and potentially reversible in untransformed fibroblasts. In these cells and in HCT116 colon cancer cells, failure to restore PML-ND number within 24 h correlates with later loss of growth potential--in fibroblasts, through prolonged cell cycle arrest and in HCT116 cells, through apoptosis. Failure to express an intact ATM/CHK2 DNA damage signalling pathway in either cell type leads to a delay in the PML-ND response to IR. Conversely, cell cycle progression following IR in cells that detect damaged DNA accelerates PML-ND reorganization. Collectively, these data show that the increase in PML-ND number seen after irradiation is, in part, triggered by the receipt of the DNA damage stimulus. The senescent cell state is also associated with chronic DNA damage and Hayflick-limited fibroblasts were found to express nuclei with elevated numbers of PML-NDs before IR that remained unresponsive to IR. Though the underlying reasons for damage-induced PML alteration remain obscure, it is noteworthy that significant numbers of PML-NDs juxtapose with ionizing radiation-induced foci after IR. The co-regulation of these structures may necessitate the stereotyped increases in PML-ND number following damage.","['Varadaraj, A', 'Dovey, C L', 'Laredj, L', 'Ferguson, B', 'Alexander, C E', 'Lubben, N', 'Wyllie, A H', 'Rich, T']","['Varadaraj A', 'Dovey CL', 'Laredj L', 'Ferguson B', 'Alexander CE', 'Lubben N', 'Wyllie AH', 'Rich T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2007/01/09 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/01/09 09:00'],"['2007/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2126 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2007 Mar;211(4):471-80. doi: 10.1002/path.2126.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2007 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between family history of specific hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies and the risk of NHL and by NHL subtypes are unclear. METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study in Connecticut women. A total of 601 histologically confirmed NHL incident cases and 717 randomly selected controls were included in the study. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between family cancer history and risk of NHL overall and by NHL subtypes. RESULTS: Compared to women who reported to have no family history of any malignancies in first-degree relatives, those who reported to have a family history of lymphoma (OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.1-4.5) or leukemia (OR = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.2-5.2) had an increased risk of NHL. The risk was higher among women who had a sibling with lymphoma or leukemia than those who had parents with lymphoma or leukemia. Several non-hematopoietic malignancies in first-degree relatives, including cancer of the lung (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.6) in first-degree relatives, stomach (OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 0.8-5.9) and pancreas (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 0.9-7.1) in parents, as well as liver (OR = 5.0, 95%CI: 1.0-24.6), breast (OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.9), cervix (OR = 7.5, 95%CI: 0.9-64.9), and ovary (OR = 3.5, 95%CI: 1.1-11.5) in siblings were also associated with an increased risk of NHL.

The possibility that this association may be sex-specific has not been explored in detail in previous studies. METHODS: In a retrospective case-control study, 732 childhood (< or =14 years) cancer cases from a population-based Registry in Northern England whose hospital birth records could be accessed and 3,723 controls matched for date and hospital of birth to the cases were compared. We examined birth weight for sex-specific associations with childhood cancer. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used for statistical evaluation of associations. RESULTS: In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (225 cases and 1,163 matched controls), birth weight and sex showed a strong interaction (P = 0.003). In boys with ALL, but not in girls, there was a nonlinear association with birth weight (P for trend = 0.008; OR = 3.05 for the highest quintile compared to the second lowest quintile, 95% CI = 1.40-6.64; P = 0.005). When birth weights were adjusted using UK standards for gestational age and sex, the risk associations were similar in statistical significance and magnitude. Maternal history of miscarriage showed an association with all cancers and individually with ALL. The miscarriage association with ALL was statistically significant in boys only (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.07-3.42; P = 0.03). A multivariable model for ALL containing other examined maternal and reproductive variables confirmed the independence of the birth weight and miscarriage associations. There was no birth weight or miscarriage associations in other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the risk associations with birth weight and miscarriages in childhood ALL. Statistically significant association of size at birth suggested marked differences in etiology between girls and boys.","['Dorak, M Tevfik', 'Pearce, Mark S', 'Hammal, Donna M', 'McNally, Richard J Q', 'Parker, Louise']","['Dorak MT', 'Pearce MS', 'Hammal DM', 'McNally RJ', 'Parker L']","['Paediatric and Lifecourse Epidemiology Research Group, Sir James Spence Institute, School of Clinical Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. tevfik.dorak@newcastle.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2007/01/09 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/01/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-006-0093-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2007 Mar;18(2):219-28. doi: 10.1007/s10552-006-0093-8.

Oxidation could lead to the formation of free radicals that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including leukemia. Leukemia is a neoplastic disease that is susceptible to antioxidant enzyme and essential elements alterations. This study was undertaken to examine the levels of essential elements, antioxidant enzymes activities, and their relationships with different types of leukemia. Serum selenium, zinc, and copper concentrations, red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, plasma Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were determined in 49 patients with different types of leukemia before initial treatment. Serum selenium and zinc concentrations were lower in leukemia patients than those of controls (p<0.01). Serum copper concentration was higher in leukemia patients than that of controls (p<0.01). The activities GPx and Cu-Zn SOD were significantly increased in leukemia patients, especially with acute leukemia (AL), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and acute nonlymphoid leukemia (ANLL) (p<0.05), whereas no difference was found between those of chronic myelogenous leukemia and the controls. The levels of LPO were normal as controls. Serum selenium concentration was not correlated with GPx, and serum levels of zinc and copper were not related to Cu-Zn SOD. Serum zinc levels had a negative correlation with the absolute peripheral blast cells, whereas serum copper had a positive correlation with the absolute peripheral blast cells. Increased GPx and Cu-Zn SOD activities and normal levels of LPO, which were a protective responses, were an indicator of mild oxidative stress; it might indicate that the essentials elements alterations in leukemia patients were mostly dependent on tumor activity. Changes of their levels demonstrated that there are low selenium, zinc, and high copper status in leukemia patients. The decrease of plasma zinc and increase of the Cu/Zn ratio could be the index that showed an unfavorable prognosis of acute leukemia.","['Zuo, X L', 'Chen, J M', 'Zhou, X', 'Li, X Z', 'Mei, G Y']","['Zuo XL', 'Chen JM', 'Zhou X', 'Li XZ', 'Mei GY']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Copper/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/classification', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Selenium/*blood', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc/*blood']",2007/01/09 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2007/01/09 09:00'],"['2005/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['BTER:114:1:41 [pii]', '10.1385/BTER:114:1:41 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2006 Winter;114(1-3):41-53. doi: 10.1385/BTER:114:1:41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL is characterized by frequent infiltration of lymph nodes, spleen, liver, skin and gut. Previously, we and others have shown that the majority of ATL cases are strongly positive for CCR4, which may explain the frequent skin invasion of ATL. Here, we examined whether ATL cells express CCR9, which is involved in T-cell homing to the gastrointestinal tract. Human T cell lines carrying HTLV-1 consistently expressed CCR9 together with the HTLV-1-encoded transcriptional activator Tax. Although ATL cells freshly isolated from peripheral blood hardly expressed CCR9, ATL cells cultured for 1 day consistently expressed CCR9 in parallel with the upregulation of Tax. Induction of Tax by Cd2+ in JPX-9, a subline of Jurkat human T cell line carrying Tax under the control of metallothionein promoter, led to upregulation of CCR9. A luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CCR9 promoter was expressed by cotransfection of an expression vector for Tax or in Cd2+-treated JPX-9 cells.

Higher levels of IL-3Ralpha, IL-2Ralpha, c-kit and FLT3 correlated with the expression of CD13/33. Increased IL-2Ralpha levels related to the presence of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), leukocytosis and shorter event-free survival (EFS). C-kit preferred in male. Elevated FLT3 levels correlated with age > or =60 years. Multivariate analysis in B-lineage ALL revealed only IL-2Ralpha (P=0.028) and Ph (P=0.020) as independent factors for EFS.

Salvage therapy consisted of ATRA and high-dose ara-C-based chemotherapy (HDAC) in most cases (83%), followed by stem-cell transplantation (autologous, 18; allogeneic, 10; syngeneic, 1). Fourteen patients with MOLrel (88%) achieved second molecular complete response (molCR), whereas 81% HEMrel patients responded to second-line treatment, with 58% molCR. After median follow-up of 45 months, four MOLrel and 18 HEMrel patients, respectively, experienced a second relapse. Outcome after MOLrel compared favorably to HEMrel, with longer survival (5-year survival: 64+/-14 vs 24+/-8%, P=0.01) and lower relapse risk (5-year relapse risk: 30+/-13 vs 64+/-9%; P=0.044). Additionally, age <or=40 and male gender were favorable variables for survival, whereas molecular response predicted longer leukemia-free survival. In conclusion, early institution of salvage therapy at molecular failure, before onset of hematological relapse, is beneficial in APL. Moreover, given the poor outcome of HEMrel managed with ATRA and HDAC, use of alternative therapeutic strategies in this setting is warranted.","['Esteve, J', 'Escoda, L', 'Martin, G', 'Rubio, V', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Rivas, C', 'Alvarez, C', 'Gonzalez San Miguel, J D', 'Brunet, S', 'Tomas, J F', 'Tormo, M', 'Sayas, M J', 'Sanchez Godoy, P', 'Colomer, D', 'Bolufer, P', 'Sanz, M A']","['Esteve J', 'Escoda L', 'Martin G', 'Rubio V', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Gonzalez M', 'Rivas C', 'Alvarez C', 'Gonzalez San Miguel JD', 'Brunet S', 'Tomas JF', 'Tormo M', 'Sayas MJ', 'Sanchez Godoy P', 'Colomer D', 'Bolufer P', 'Sanz MA']","['Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain. jesteve@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'AIDA protocol', 'LPA97R protocol', 'MEA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404501 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404501 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Mar;21(3):446-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404501.

We show that sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) potently inhibits FLT3 enzymatic and signaling activities. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with FLT3-WT or FLT3-ITD, sorafenib blocked basal and ligand dependent FLT3-mediated tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and Stat5 phosphorylation. In leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and EOL-1, sorafenib treatment resulted in decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of FLT3 signaling. The growth of the FLT3-independent RS4-11 cell line was only weakly inhibited by sorafenib. Cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis were observed upon treatment with sorafenib in MV4-11 and EOL-1 cells. The antitumor efficacy of sorafenib was evaluated against the MV4-11 leukemia grown subcutaneously in NCr nu/nu mice. Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg administered orally for 14 days resulted in six and nine out of 10 animals with complete responses, respectively.

After initiating treatment, both patients showed leukemic differentiation in their peripheral blood and reduction in bone marrow blasts to less than 5%. One patient had a significant improvement in her platelet count with loss of platelet transfusion needs. Differentiation syndrome occurred in one patient and was successfully treated with steroids and discontinuation of bexarotene.

The cells undergo dramatic changes in morphology and an ordered program of gene expression changes representing differentiation to all three germ layers over the first 3-5 days of LIF withdrawal. We observed a global increase in acetylation on histone H4 and to a lesser extent on histone H3 over this time period. Treatment of the cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induced changes in morphology, gene expression, and histone acetylation that mimicked differentiation induced by withdrawal of LIF. We examined localized histone acetylation in the regulatory regions of genes that were transcriptionally either active in undifferentiated cells, induced during differentiation, or inactive under all treatments. There was striking concordance in the histone acetylation patterns of specific genes induced by both TSA and LIF withdrawal. Increased histone acetylation in local regions correlated best with induction of gene expression. Finally, TSA treatment did not support the maintenance or progression of differentiation. Upon removal of TSA, the cells reverted to the undifferentiated phenotype. We concluded that increased histone acetylation at specific genes played a role in their expression, but additional events are required for maintenance of differentiated gene expression and loss of the pluripotent state.","['McCool, Kevin W', 'Xu, Xiaojie', 'Singer, Don B', 'Murdoch, Fern E', 'Fritsch, Michael K']","['McCool KW', 'Xu X', 'Singer DB', 'Murdoch FE', 'Fritsch MK']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/06/19 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)52281-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M609519200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Mar 2;282(9):6696-706. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M609519200.

Role of aspartate 199 of the second extracellular loop of CXCR2 in CXCL8-mediated rapid receptor internalization.,6906-15,"CXCL8 (interleukin-8) interacts with two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, to activate leukocytes. Upon activation, CXCR2 internalizes very rapidly relative to CXCR1 ( approximately 90% versus approximately 10% after 5 min). The C termini of the receptors have been shown to be necessary for internalization but are not sufficient to explain the distinct kinetics of down-regulation. To determine the structural determinant(s) that modulate receptor internalization, various chimeric and point mutant receptors were generated by progressively exchanging specific domains or amino acids between CXCR1 and CXCR2. The receptors were stably expressed in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells and characterized for receptor binding, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, phosphorylation, internalization, and MAPK activation. The data herein indicate that the second extracellular loop (2ECL) of the receptors is critical for the distinct rate of internalization. Replacing the 2ECL of CXCR2 with that of CXCR1 (B(2ECL)A) or Asp(199) with its CXCR1 valine counterpart (B(D199V)A) delayed CXCR2 internalization similarly to CXCR1. Replacing Asp(199) with Asn (B(D199N)) restored CXCR2 rapid internalization. Structure modeling of the 2ECL of the receptors also suggested that Asp(199) plays a critical role in stabilizing and modulating CXCR2 rapid internalization relative to CXCR1. B(D199N) internalized rapidly but migrated as a single phosphorylated form like CXCR1 ( approximately 75 kDa), whereas B(2ECL)A and B(D199V)A showed slow and fast migrating forms like CXCR2 ( approximately 45 and approximately 65 kDa, respectively) but internalized like CXCR1. These data further undermine the role of receptor oligomerization in CXCL8 receptor internalization. Like CXCR1, B(D199V)A also induced sustained ERK activation and cross-desensitized Ca(2+) mobilization to CCR5 relative to B(D199N) and CXCR2. Altogether, the data suggest that the 2ECL of the CXCL8 receptors is important in modulating their distinct rate of down-regulation and thereby signal length and post-internalization activities.","['Nasser, Mohd W', 'Raghuwanshi, Sandeep K', 'Malloy, Kimberly M', 'Gangavarapu, Pavani', 'Shim, Joong-Youn', 'Rajarathnam, Krishna', 'Richardson, Ricardo M']","['Nasser MW', 'Raghuwanshi SK', 'Malloy KM', 'Gangavarapu P', 'Shim JY', 'Rajarathnam K', 'Richardson RM']","['Julius L.

These unique properties of QDots have been utilized to develop a fluorescent binding assay using biotinylated human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (biot-HTLV-1) conjugated with streptavidin-coated QDots that enabled both qualitative and quantitative analyses of viral binding. The specificity and linearity of the assay was demonstrated utilizing T cells, the primary HTLV-1-susceptible cell population. Furthermore, differential binding of HTLV-1 was analyzed in additional cell types of clinical relevance including primary CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, bone marrow progenitor cells, and epithelial cells. DCs exhibited maximum binding affinity when compared to other examined cell types except the Jurkat and SUP-T1 T cell lines. Finally, blocking antibodies directed against a putative HTLV-1 receptor on DCs; DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin), were utilized to study the inhibition of HTLV-1 binding to target cells. Overall, these results demonstrated that this novel high throughput assay can be utilized to study the binding of a biotinylated virus and has implications for screening of viral binding inhibitors as well as host membrane proteins that may serve as receptors for viral entry.","['Kampani, Karan', 'Quann, Kevin', 'Ahuja, Jaya', 'Wigdahl, Brian', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Kampani K', 'Quann K', 'Ahuja J', 'Wigdahl B', 'Khan ZK', 'Jain P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Center for Molecular Virology and Neuroimmunology, Center for Cancer Biology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,,IM,"['Biotinylation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescence', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Quantum Dots', 'Virus Attachment']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-0934(06)00421-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jviromet.2006.11.043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2007 May;141(2):125-32. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2006.11.043.

Also, they can sustain self-renewal in vitro owing to symmetrical mitosis, i.e., only the cell number increases while the daughter cells remain pluripotent. Self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells are under stringent regulation of several signaling pathways. Activation of either JAK-STAT3 or PI3K, the downstream cascade of gp130, can maintain the self-renewal of ES cells, while phosphorylation of another gp130-related branch, SHP2-Ras-ERK, drives the differentiation. BMP2/4-mediated signaling is capable of suppressing the differentiation of ES cells in collaboration with activated JAK-STAT3 under serum free culture conditions. Other signaling such as Wnt also contributes to the self-renewal of ES cells. Generally, the network, which is composed of various signaling pathways, modulates the self-renewal and differentiation of mouse ES cells precisely. This review focuses on the role of gp130 in proliferation of mouse ES cells including inhibitory effect of JAK-STAT3 pathway activation on differentiation of mouse ES cells, maintenance effect of PI3K pathway activation on self-renewal of ES cells, promotive effect of SHP-2-Ras-ERK pathway activation on differentiation of ES cells, and influence of other signaling pathways on self-renewal of mouse ES cells, including maintenance effect of BMP combination with LIF under serum free culture conditions on self-renewal of ES cells and promotive effect of Wnt pathway activation on self-renewal of ES cells.","['Wang, Xiao-Yan', 'Liu, Bing', 'Mao, Ning']","['Wang XY', 'Liu B', 'Mao N']","['Institute of Basic Medical Science, Acadecy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)06-1248-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Dec;14(6):1248-52.,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of TRAIL death receptor and TRAIL decoy receptor mRNA in these three cell lines were assayed by semiquantitive RT-PCR before and after treatment with DNR. The results indicated that K562 and U937 were sensitive to rmhTRIAL. DNR had synergistic inhibitory effect with rmhTRAIL on the growth of K562 and U937 cell lines (P < 0.05). The expression level of DR4 and DR5 mRNA was significantly higher in K562 and U937 with combined treatment of rmhTRAIL and DNR than that in those alone, while the expressions of DcR1 and DcR2 mRNA were not influenced.

Human erythroleukemic cell line K562 was co-cultured with the above-mentioned drugs. Cells were collected after 24, 48 and 72 hours for further detection. Telomere length and telomerase activity were detected by Southern-blot and PCR-ELISA respectively. The effects of these drugs were observed at different concentrations and exposure time. The results showed that (1) ginseng saponin, arsenic trioxide, beta-elemene, or CTX could completely inhibit the telomerase activity of K562 cells at proper concentrations and exposure time. The inhibiting effects were enhanced when the three former drugs were used with CTX. Telomerase activity decreased proportionally with the concentrations and length of time. (2) viability of K562 cells was decreased after being co-cultured with arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, beta-elemene and CTX. The level of inhibition depends on the concentration and exposure time. (3) telomere length of K562 cells was 5.36 +/- 0.18 kb. After being co-cultured with those drugs for 72 hours, telomere length was 5.90 kb -6.50 kb, significantly longer than that of control (5.18 - 5.35 kb). It is concluded that arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, and beta-elemene can inhibit the growth and telomerase activity of K562 cells. The inhibiting effects were enhanced when they were used in combination with CTX. The depression of telomerase activity may be one of the mechanisms of anti-tumor effect. Less dosage and shorter course can be expected when arsenic trioxide, ginseng saponin, and beta-elemene are used in combination with CTX. When telomerase activity was depressed, the telomere length prolonged a little, indicating K562 cell line may extend telomeres by some alternative way other than telomerase activation.","['Wang, Yi', 'Fang, Mei-Yun']","['Wang Y', 'Fang MY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116011, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (beta-elemene)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', '*Panax/chemistry', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Telomere/drug effects']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)06-1089-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Dec;14(6):1089-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-four differentially expressed proteins were identified and categorized into five main functional classes: (I) heat shock proteins and chaperones; (II) nucleic acid interacting proteins (binding/synthesis/stability); (III) structural proteins, (IV) cell signaling, and (V) metabolic enzymes. Several heat shock proteins known to complex Bcr-Abl were overexpressed in imatinib resistant cells, showing a possible involvement of these proteins in the mechanism of resistance. HnRNPs also resulted in being up-regulated in imatinib resistant cells. These proteins have been shown to be strongly and directly related to Bcr-Abl activity.

A thorough investigation of these mechanisms and the response to pharmacologic modifiers will provide a better understanding of the role of histone acetylation in leukemogenesis. We describe here an analytical approach that combines acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE), amino acid coded mass tagging (AACM), and mass spectrometry (MS) for the investigation of histone acetylation patterns. The combined approach was used to follow the dynamics of H4 acetylation in Kasumi-1 cells harboring the fusion gene AML1/ETO shown to aberrantly recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). The histones in Kasumi-1 cells were labeled by growing the cells in media in which lysine was replaced with stable isotope-labeled lysine (Lys-D4). Labeled and unlabeled cells were treated with depsipeptide and analyzed at different time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h). The cells were mixed, the histone was extracted, and acetylated H4 isoforms were separated using AU-PAGE before in-gel trypsin digestion. The digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Peptides were identified by mass and isotope pattern. LC-MS/MS of Arg-C digests were also performed to verify the acetylation pattern for H4. The major pattern of acetylation was determined as follows: initial acetylation at K16, followed by acetylation at K12, and finally acetylation of either K8 and/or K5.","['Zhang, Liwen', 'Su, Xiaodan', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Knapp, Amy R', 'Parthun, Mark R', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Freitas, Michael A']","['Zhang L', 'Su X', 'Liu S', 'Knapp AR', 'Parthun MR', 'Marcucci G', 'Freitas MA']","['Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Campus Chemical Instrument Center, Department of Chemistry, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Histones)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'Q40Q9N063P (Acetic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetic Acid/*chemistry', 'Acetylation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Urea/*pharmacology']",2007/01/06 09:00,2007/07/25 09:00,['2007/01/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/pr060139u [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2007 Jan;6(1):81-8. doi: 10.1021/pr060139u.,"['R01 GM062970/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA111026-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA111026-02A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA111026-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62970/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA111026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2759876,['NIHMS73812'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing growth inhibition and growth recovery assays, we evaluated the in vitro effects of four of these dimers (No. 2, 2A, 3, 10) in L1210 and P388D1 murine leukemia cells. Although ara-C and 5-FdUrd appeared equimolar in all dimers, their contribution to the cytotoxicity of these agents was different. Thus, the liberation of ara-C and 5-FdUrd from their dimeric origin and their subsequent metabolic activation had a different course. In another set of experiments, we examined the in vivo effects of these agents in mice. The dimer with the highest cytotoxicity in vitro exerted the lowest acute toxicity and yielded the lowest therapeutic effect in vivo. The obtained data indicate that dimers with slower liberation of ara-C and 5-FdUrd were less cytotoxic, but prolonged liberation of both antimetabolites protected them from inactivation and extended the time period of therapeutic action. Some of the dimers exceeded the synergistic effects yielded by simultaneous application of both ara-C and 5-FdUrd.

New treatment strategies combining demethylating agents, such as decitabine, and drugs that induce myelomonocytic differentiation (i.e. Vitamin D3) may re-establish functional hematopoiesis in these patients. We studied the effects of decitabine alone or in combination with Vitamin D3 (VD3) on U937 cells and AML blasts. Preincubation with decitabine (0.1-1 microM) and subsequent exposure to VD3 (3 nM) synergistically induced monocytic differentiation. To elucidate the mechanisms of decitabine- and VD3-induced monocytic differentiation, we investigated the effects of the two drugs on transcription factors implicated in monocytic differentiation. Northern and Western blotting showed that decitabine induced transcription of c-jun but not PU.1, while VD3 increased PU.1, IRF8, and C/EBPbeta but not c-jun. Using electromobility shift assays, we demonstrated increased DNA binding of nuclear proteins from decitabine- and VD3-induced U937 cells to the CD11b promoter. In addition, we investigated whether the myeloid transcription factor Sp1 played a role in decitabine- and VD3-induced CD14 expression. Indeed, we found that mithramycin A, a specific inhibitor of Sp1, inhibited both VD3- and decitabine-induced upregulation of CD14, which is in line with previous data showing that Sp1 is critical for CD14 promoter activity. Induction of CD11b and/or CD14 by decitabine and/or VD3 was confirmed in primary AML patient samples at the time of diagnosis. In conclusion, decitabine synergizes with Vitamin D3 to induce CD11b and CD14 expression, likely by enhancing PU.1/c-jun and Sp1 transcriptional activity.","['Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Huettner, Claudia S', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert L', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Koschmieder S', 'Agrawal S', 'Radomska HS', 'Huettner CS', 'Tenen DG', 'Ottmann OG', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve HL', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Munster, Germany. steffen.koschmieder@ukmuenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/*biosynthesis', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Plicamycin/pharmacology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Feb;30(2):349-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3-induced apoptosis is associated with reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi), enhanced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria into cytoplasm, activation of caspases, and upregulation of Bax and Bim expression. Exogenous glutathione (GSH) reverses the As2O3-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether, these data indicate that As2O3 induces apoptosis in B cells, regardless of Bcl-2 expression, via the mitochondrial pathway by enhancing oxidative stress.","['Baysan, Abdullah', 'Yel, Leman', 'Gollapudi, Sastry', 'Su, Houfen', 'Gupta, Sudhir']","['Baysan A', 'Yel L', 'Gollapudi S', 'Su H', 'Gupta S']","['Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*biosynthesis']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Feb;30(2):313-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, WNT5A was characterized as the evolutionarily conserved target of the STAT3 signaling cascade based on 11-bp-spaced tandem STAT3-binding sites within intron 4 of human, chimpanzee, cow, mouse and rat WNT5A orthologs. Canonical WNT5A signaling through Frizzled and LRP5/LRP6 receptors activates FGF20, WISP1, MYC and CCND1 transcription for the maintenance of stem/progenitor cells, while non-canonical WNT5A signaling through Frizzled and ROR2/PTK7/RYK receptors activates the RHOA, JNK, NLK and NFAT signaling cascades for the control of tissue polarity, cell adhesion or movement. LIF-induced Wnt5a activates canonical Wnt signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells for self-renewal. STAT3-induced Wnt5a activates non-canonical Wnt signaling in rat cardiac myocytes for N-cadherin-dependent aggregation. IL6, secreted from epithelial cells or macrophages, induces WNT5A upregulation in mesenchymal cells. WNT5A then activates canonical WNT signaling in epithelial cells. IL6-induced WNT5A activates canonical WNT signaling for autocrine proliferation of human synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis. IL-6 signaling is activated during human chronic atrophic gastritis with Helicobacter pylori infection, and aberrant Stat3 signaling activation gives rise to mouse gastric tumors. WNT5A is frequently upregulated in human primary gastric cancer due to tumor-stromal interaction. WNT5A might be downregulated in advanced cancer with poorer prognosis due to genetic alterations compensating WNT5A signaling. Oncogenic WNT5A activates canonical WNT signaling in cancer stem cells for self-renewal, and non-canonical WNT signaling at the tumor-stromal interface for invasion and metastasis. SNP of genes encoding components of the cytokine-induced WNT5A signaling loop is a predicted risk factor for RA and cancer, especially diffuse-type gastric and pancreatic cancer. Humanized anti-IL6 receptor antibody and WNT5A mimetic small-molecule antagonist could be applied to personalized medicine for RA and cancer driven by the IL6-induced WNT5A signaling loop.","['Katoh, Masuko', 'Katoh, Masaru']","['Katoh M', 'Katoh M']","['M&M Medical BioInformatics, Hongo 113-0033, Japan. mkatoh-kkr@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2007 Feb;19(2):273-8.,,,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,

EXEGESIS: A 21-year old woman with a previous history of erythema nodosum and episcleritis was admitted for a left cervical mass. Diagnostic imaging showed an aneurism of the left extracranial internal carotid and a stenosis of the left subclavian artery. Histological findings of the carotid aneurism revealed a granulomatous giant cell arteritis consistent with Takayasu's arteritis. Two weeks after, she was discharged, elevated white cell count (440.000/mm3 ) was disclosed. A bone marrow aspirate documented an acute myeloid leukemia. The patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Leucocytoclastic vasculitis and polyarteritis nodosa occur in acute myeloid leukemia, but the association with Takayasu's arteritis is new.

In addition, we demonstrated that palmitoylation of tubulin is inhibited in vitro by stoichiometric levels of the chemotherapeutic drug, vinblastine. Here, we sought to determine whether a clinically relevant dose of vinblastine inhibits palmitoylation of tubulin in vivo. METHODS: Human CEM leukemic lymphocytes were incubated with [3H]palmitate in the presence and absence of a low, clinically relevant dose of vinblastine. [3H]palmitoylated tubulin was identified by two-dimensional PAGE and autoradiography. RESULTS: We found, first, that tubulin was palmitoylated in CEM cells. Second, the clinically relevant dose of vinblastine inhibited palmitoylation of tubulin in vivo in CEM cells. In addition, microtubules were disassembled and cells became apoptotic. CONCLUSION: This study identifies a previously unknown mechanism of action of vinblastine, the depalmitoylation of tubulin, and suggests that depalmitoylation of tubulin may be a target for new chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Caron, Joan M', 'Herwood, Margot']","['Caron JM', 'Herwood M']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT 06030, USA. caron@nsol.uchc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microtubules/chemistry/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Palmitates/*metabolism', 'Tubulin/analysis/*metabolism', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/03/17 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['000098419 [pii]', '10.1159/000098419 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2007;53(1):51-8. doi: 10.1159/000098419.

Additionally, we compared these causes of hypercalcemia with the previously published international data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed all patients with hypercalcemia in a community teaching hospital in Okinawa, Japan, from 1999 to 2002 and determined the cause of hypercalcemia in each patient. We also performed a literature review of the original articles describing causes of hypercalcemia in patients from Eastern as well as Western countries. RESULTS: We identified 145 patients with hypercalcemia (median age, 69; range, 22 to 97). Major causes included malignant disorders (n=100; 69%), primary hyperparathyroidism (n=31; 21%), vitamin D-induced (n=4; 3%), and miscellaneous or unknown cause in 11 (8%). Among malignant disorders, adult T cell leukemia was the most frequent (n=35), being followed by lung cancer (n=25). Breast carcinoma was less prevalent (n=4). CONCLUSION: The major causes of hypercalcemia are malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism in Okinawan Japanese patients. Adult T cell leukemia and lung carcinoma are among the top leading malignancies, while breast carcinoma is less frequent in this patient population. The etiologic prevalence of hypercalcemia in the Eastern population including Okinawans is significantly different from that in the Western population.","['Tokuda, Yasuharu', 'Maezato, Kyouko', 'Stein, Gerald H']","['Tokuda Y', 'Maezato K', 'Stein GH']","[""Department of Medicine, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo. tokuyasu@orange.ocn.ne.jp""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Far East', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hyperparathyroidism/*complications', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Western World']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/46.6052 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.46.6052 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2007;46(1):23-8. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.46.6052.

The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of body mass index (BMI) for age as a tool to prospectively identify pediatric cancer patients at risk for malnutrition and to determine the BMI percentile that would be required to identify at-risk patients. METHODS: This study was conducted by a retrospective chart review of 1839 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Those falling below the 10(th) percentile on any one category of height for age (HFA), weight for age (WFA), or weight for height (WFH) were classified with regard to nutrition risk and compared with those identified as at risk by BMI for age (BFA). The BMI percentiles of the lower 9(th)-11(th) percentile patients on the HFA, WFA, and WFH growth charts were averaged in an attempt to determine a useful value to identify nutrition risk. RESULTS: Lack of agreement was found to exist between BFA and HFA in identifying patients at risk for malnutrition, and also between BFA and WFA. Significant agreement was found to exist between BFA and WFH. The BMI percentile required to identify those at risk for malnutrition by the other growth charts would classify too many patients as being at risk for malnutrition to be considered clinically useful. CONCLUSIONS: Although research has shown BMI is appropriate to use in the nutrition assessment of children, its usefulness has not been confirmed in the pediatric oncology patient; therefore, further study is warranted.

Cotreatment of PBOX-6 with STI-571 induced significantly more apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-positive CML cell lines (K562 and LAMA-84) than either drug alone (P < 0.01). Cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells showed that STI-571 significantly reduced PBOX-6-induced G2M arrest and polyploid formation with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in K562 CML cells using lead MTAs (paclitaxel and nocodazole) in combination with STI-571. Potentiation of PBOX-6-induced apoptosis by STI-571 was specific to Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells with no cytoxic effects observed on normal peripheral blood cells. The combined treatment of STI-571 and PBOX-6 was associated with the down-regulation of Bcr-Abl and repression of proteins involved in Bcr-Abl transformation, namely the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. Importantly, PBOX-6/STI-571 combinations were also effective in STI-571-resistant cells. Together, these findings highlight the potential clinical benefits in simultaneously targeting the microtubules and the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in STI-571-sensitive and -resistant CML cells.","['Greene, Lisa M', 'Kelly, Liam', 'Onnis, Valeria', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Greene LM', 'Kelly L', 'Onnis V', 'Campiani G', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.106.116640 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.106.116640 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Apr;321(1):288-97. doi: 10.1124/jpet.106.116640.

Targeting v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (erbB) receptors with mAbs promoted erbB tetrameric assembly, suggesting that a component of the antitumor activity may be mediated by the ability of Abs to shift the equilibrium from active dimeric to impaired tetrameric receptor complex states.

Using in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescent imaging, we observed that donor CD8(+) T cells expanded rapidly and infiltrated GVHD target tissues in TBI-conditioned recipients, but donor CD8(+) T cell expansion in anti-CD3-conditioned recipients was confined to lymphohematological tissues. This confinement was associated with lack of up-regulated expression of alpha(4)beta(7) integrin and chemokine receptors (i.e., CXCR3) on donor CD8(+) T cells. In addition, donor CD8(+) T cells in anti-CD3-conditioned recipients were rendered unresponsive, anergic, Foxp3(+), or type II cytotoxic T phenotype.

In the present study, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both the p85alpha subunit of PI3K and Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 could be recruited by IREM-1 in transfected cells as well as in the U937 monocytic leukemia cells, which constitutively express the receptor. By assaying the ability of different IREM-1 mutants to regulate the secretion of beta-hexosaminidase induced via FcRepsilonI in rat basophilic leukemia cells, both Y205 and Y249 appeared crucial for IREM-1-mediated inhibition. Remarkably, engagement of an IREM-1 mutant (Y(205,249,284)F), which did not recruit Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 and lost its inhibitory function, induced rat basophilic leukemia cell degranulation. This effect was dependent on the recruitment of PI3K, requiring the integrity of Y236 and Y263, and was blocked by PI3K inhibitors (i.e., wortmannin and LY-294002).

Bcr/Abl point mutations and other alterations reduce the kinase inhibitory activity of imatinib mesylate; thus, agents that target Bcr/Abl through unique mechanisms may be needed. Here we describe the activity of WP1130, a small molecule that specifically and rapidly down-regulates both wild-type and mutant Bcr/Abl protein without affecting bcr/abl gene expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Loss of Bcr/Abl protein correlated with the onset of apoptosis and reduced phosphorylation of Bcr/Abl substrates. WP1130 did not affect Hsp90/Hsp70 ratios within the cells and did not require the participation of the proteasomal pathway for loss of Bcr/Abl protein. WP1130 was more effective in reducing leukemic versus normal hematopoietic colony formation and strongly inhibited colony formation of cells derived from patients with T315I mutant Bcr/Abl-expressing CML in blast crisis. WP1130 suppressed the growth of K562 heterotransplanted tumors as well as both wild-type Bcr/Abl and T315I mutant Bcr/Abl-expressing BaF/3 cells transplanted into nude mice.

Patients with APL respond to differentiation therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid, which induces PML/RAR alpha degradation. When resistance to all-trans-retinoic acid develops, an effective treatment is arsenic trioxide (arsenite), which also induces this degradation. We investigated the mechanism of arsenite-induced PML/RAR alpha degradation. METHODS: NB4-S1 APL cells were treated with clinically relevant concentrations of arsenite. Lysosomes were visualized with a lysosome-specific dye. Lysosomal protein esterase was measured by immunoblot analysis. Lysosomal cathepsin L was detected by immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy, and its activity was measured in cytosolic cellular fractions. In vitro degradation assays of PML/RAR alpha in cell lysates were performed with and without protease inhibitors and assessed by immunoblot analysis. Only nonparametric two-sided statistical analyses were used. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used for group comparison, and the nonlinear regression technique was used for analysis of dose-response relationship as a function of arsenite concentration. RESULTS: Arsenite treatment destabilized lysosomes in APL cells. Lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin L, were released from lysosomes 5 minutes to 6 hours after arsenite treatment. PML/RAR alpha was degraded by lysate from arsenite-treated APL cells, and the degradation was inhibited by protease inhibitors. At both 6 and 24 hours, substantially fewer arsenite-treated APL cells, than untreated cells, contained cathepsin L clusters, a reflection of cathepsin L delocalization. Cells with cathepsin L clusters decreased as a function of arsenite concentration at rates of -2.03% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.01 to -.045; P = .045) and -2.39% (95% CI = -4.54 to -.024; P = .029) in 6- and 24-hour treatment groups, respectively, per 1.0 microM increase in arsenite concentration. Statistically significantly higher cytosolic cathepsin L activity was detected in lysates of arsenite-treated APL cells than in control lysates. For example, the mean increase in cathepsin activity at 6 hours and 1.0 microM arsenite was 26.3% (95% CI = 3.3% to 33%; P < .001), compared with untreated cells.

Analysis of publicly available databases can help identify potential candidates for genes or mutations specifically related to the cancer phenotype. In spite of their huge potential to affect gene function, no systematic attention has been paid so far to the changes that occur in untranslated regions of mRNA. RESULTS: In this study, we used Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) databases as a source for cancer-related sequence polymorphism discovery at the whole-genome level. Using a novel computational procedure, we focused on the identification of untranslated region (UTR)-localized non-coding Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (UTR-SNPs) significantly associated with the tumoral state. To explore possible relationships between genetic mutation and phenotypic variation, bioinformatic tools were used to predict the potential impact of cancer-associated UTR-SNPs on mRNA secondary structure and UTR regulatory elements. We provide a comprehensive and unbiased description of cancer-associated UTR-SNPs that may be useful to define genotypic markers or to propose polymorphisms that can act to alter gene expression levels. Our results suggest that a fraction of cancer-associated UTR-SNPs may have functional consequences on mRNA stability and/or expression. CONCLUSION: We have undertaken a comprehensive effort to identify cancer-associated polymorphisms in untranslated regions of mRNA and to characterize putative functional UTR-SNPs. Alteration of translational control can change the expression of genes in tumor cells, causing an increase or decrease in the concentration of specific proteins. Through the description of testable candidates and the experimental validation of a number of UTR-SNPs discovered on the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) gene, this report illustrates the utility of a cross-talk between in silico transcriptomics and cancer genetics.","['Aouacheria, Abdel', 'Navratil, Vincent', 'Lopez-Perez, Ricardo', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Churkin, Alexander', 'Barash, Danny', 'Mouchiroud, Dominique', 'Gautier, Christian']","['Aouacheria A', 'Navratil V', 'Lopez-Perez R', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Churkin A', 'Barash D', 'Mouchiroud D', 'Gautier C']","['Laboratory of Biometry and Evolutionary Biology, CNRS UMR 5558, Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, 69622 Villeurbanne, France. a.aouacheria@ibcp.fr <a.aouacheria@ibcp.fr>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Untranslated Regions)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Osteonectin/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'Untranslated Regions/chemistry/*genetics']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-8-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Jan 3;8:2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-2.,,PMC1774567,,,,20070103,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its therapeutic mechanisms remain largely unclear. To investigate the biological effect of Schisandra fructus water extract (SFWE), we examined the effect of SFWE on the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore A23187-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the human mast cell line HMC-1. HMC-1 cells were stimulated with PMA plus A23187 in the presence or absence of SFWE. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) productions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Inhibitory IkappaB/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression was assessed by western blot. SFWE suppressed PMA plus A23187-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and GM-CSF production in dose-dependent manners. Furthermore, SFWE inhibited IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. These results suggest that SFWE inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HMC-1 cells through blockade of IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, these findings may help elucidate the mechanism of action of this medicine in the modulation of mast cell activation in inflammatory conditions.","['Kang, Ok Hwa', 'Chae, Hee-Sung', 'Choi, Jung-Hyun', 'Choi, Hyuk Joon', 'Park, Pil Sang', 'Cho, Sun Hee', 'Lee, Go-Hoon', 'So, Hye-Young', 'Choo, Young Kug', 'Kweon, Oh-Hyun', 'Kwon, Dong-Yeul']","['Kang OH', 'Chae HS', 'Choi JH', 'Choi HJ', 'Park PS', 'Cho SH', 'Lee GH', 'So HY', 'Choo YK', 'Kweon OH', 'Kwon DY']","['Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schisandra/*chemistry', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Water']",2007/01/05 09:00,2007/04/24 09:00,['2007/01/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jmf.2006.9.480 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2006 Winter;9(4):480-6. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2006.9.480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no efficient therapy has been established to date for glioblastoma multiforme. The aim of the present study was to analyze the activity of bortezomib in glioblastoma cell lines in comparison with that in a pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glioblastoma multiforme T98G, glioblastoma-astrocytoma U373M and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cell lines were used. Proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib and 14 other anticancer drugs were tested using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Compared to the acute lymphoblastic cell line, both glioblastoma cell lines showed relatively good sensitivity to bortezomib, as well as to cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide and actinomycin-D. The lines showed intermediate sensitivity to thiotepa and daunorubicin, but were highly resistant to first-line drugs used in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, such as prednisolone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, doxorubicin and cytarabine. Bortezomib, which is not a substrate for PGP and MRP1, did not show cross resistance to drugs transported by these proteins.

Results of flow cytometry and DAPI staining assays indicated that curcumin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the examined cells. The results from flow cytometry assay indicated that curcumin induced ROS and Ca+2 productions, decreased the levels of MMP and increased the activity of caspase-3, leading to cell apoptosis. Western blot assay also revealed that curcumin increased the levels of Bax and the release of cytochrome c, and decreased the levels of Bcl-2 in the examined cells.

We exploited a novel functional assay that uses BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3) peptides to predict dependence on antiapoptotic proteins, a strategy we call BH3 profiling. BH3 profiling accurately predicts sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. BH3 profiling also accurately distinguishes myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) from BCL2 dependence in myeloma cell lines. We show that the special sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL2 antagonism arises from the requirement that BCL2 tonically sequester proapoptotic BIM in CLL. ABT-737 displaced BIM from BCL2's BH3-binding pocket, allowing BIM to activate BAX, induce mitochondrial permeabilization, and rapidly commit the CLL cell to death. Our experiments demonstrate that BCL2 expression alone does not dictate sensitivity to ABT-737. Instead, BCL2 complexed to BIM is the critical target for ABT-737 in CLL. An important implication is that in cancer, BCL2 may not effectively buffer chemotherapy death signals if it is already sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. Indeed, activator BH3-only occupation of BCL2 may prime cancer cells for death, offering a potential explanation for the marked chemosensitivity of certain cancers that express abundant BCL2, such as CLL and follicular lymphoma.","['Del Gaizo Moore, Victoria', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Certo, Michael', 'Love, Tara M', 'Novina, Carl D', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Del Gaizo Moore V', 'Brown JR', 'Certo M', 'Love TM', 'Novina CD', 'Letai A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/drug effects/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/03/08 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI28281 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Jan;117(1):112-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI28281.,"['K23 CA115682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA070083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA10254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA70083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1716201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of dose-dense chemotherapy consisting of a standard regime at 10- to 11-day intervals in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting. A 2-day window was allowed for scheduling logistics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-nine women with early-stage breast carcinoma were accrued from April 2004 to October 2004. Median age was 47 years (range, 26-67 years). Patients received therapy with 100 mg/m(2) epirubicin and 600 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide (EC) q 10 to 11 days for four cycles followed by 175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel q 10 to 11 days for four cycles, all with filgrastim support (300 microg s.c. daily) from day 2 to 24 h before the next treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-five (90%) patients completed all planned therapy. The median intertreatment interval was 10 days (range, 8-28 days). Cycles (80.7%) were delivered at no more than 10- to 11-day intervals. There were five dose reductions of 25% for grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity in five patients. Six (16%) patients developed febrile neutropenia defined as temperature >38 degrees C with absolute neutrophil count <1,000/microL. All febrile neutropenia was during therapy with EC. Other grade 3 toxicities included bone pain, hand and foot syndrome, neuropathy, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with EC for four cycles followed by paclitaxel for four cycles at 10- to 11-day intervals is feasible. The approximately 30% reduction in intertreatment interval compared with every 14-day treatment could increase the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Fornier, Monica N', 'Seidman, Andrew D', 'Lake, Diana', ""D'Andrea, Gabriella"", 'Bromberg, Jacqueline', 'Robson, Mark', 'Van Poznak, Catherine', 'Panageas, Katherine S', 'Atienza, Marietta', 'Norton, Larry', 'Hudis, Clifford']","['Fornier MN', 'Seidman AD', 'Lake D', ""D'Andrea G"", 'Bromberg J', 'Robson M', 'Van Poznak C', 'Panageas KS', 'Atienza M', 'Norton L', 'Hudis C']","['Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. fornierm@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Epirubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/1/223 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1731 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 1;13(1):223-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies showed that the enhanced expression of VCP in cancer cells correlated with invasion and metastasis of cancers. Here, the regulatory mechanism for VCP transcription was investigated. Luciferase reporter constructs containing serially deleted 5'-flanking region of the VCP gene were transfected into MCF7 mammary carcinoma cell line, in which VCP was abundantly expressed. The deletion and mutation at the two binding motifs for pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) reduced the luciferase activity, indicating that these two PBX1 motifs mediated the transactivation of the VCP gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the binding of PBX-1 to the 5'-flanking region of the VCP gene. The knockdown of PBX1 by siRNA decreased the expression level of VCP. VCP is reported to maintain cell viability after the treatment of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The viability of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-treated cells was significantly reduced in PBX1 knockdown MCF7. These findings indicate that PBX1 plays a crucial role in VCP expression and function and that the PBX-VCP pathway might be important for cell survival under cytokine stress.","['Qiu, Ying', 'Tomita, Yasuhiko', 'Zhang, Binglin', 'Nakamichi, Itsuko', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Aozasa, Katsuyuki']","['Qiu Y', 'Tomita Y', 'Zhang B', 'Nakamichi I', 'Morii E', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Medical School of Tongji University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (VCP protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (Valosin Containing Protein)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region/genetics"", 'Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Valosin Containing Protein']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)60842-5 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2007.060722 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2007 Jan;170(1):152-9. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.060722.,,PMC1762682,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the hypothesis that selective degradation of anti-apoptotic regulatory protein(s) is responsible for apoptosis resulting from translation inhibition. Induction of apoptosis by cycloheximide was detected within 2-4 h and blocked by proteasome inhibitors, indicating that degradation of short-lived protein(s) was required. Caspase inhibition and overexpression of Bcl-x(L) blocked cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. In addition, cycloheximide induced rapid activation of Bak and Bax, which required proteasome activity. Mcl-1 was degraded by the proteasome with a half-life of approximately 30 min following inhibition of protein synthesis, preceding Bak/Bax activation and the onset of apoptosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 blocked apoptosis induced by cycloheximide, whereas RNA interference knockdown of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis. Knockdown of Bim and Bak, downstream targets of Mcl-1, inhibited cycloheximide-induced apoptosis, as did knockdown of Bax. Apoptosis resulting from inhibition of translation thus involves the rapid degradation of Mcl-1, leading to activation of Bim, Bak, and Bax.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line. PROCEDURES: The full-length canine mdr1 cDNA clone isolated in our laboratory was inserted into a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector to construct the retroviral vector, pLNC-cMDR1. After retroviral transduction of pLNC-cMDR1 into MDCK cells, the expression and function of the P-glycoprotein, a product of mdr1, were assessed by immunoblotting, measurement of rhodamine123 (Rh123) retention, and drug sensitivity assays. RESULTS: P-glycoprotein was strongly expressed in cells transduced with pLNC-cMDR1. This P-glycoprotein was fully functional, as demonstrated by the decreased Rh123 retention and the increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Measured as 50% inhibitory concentrations, resistance increased 59 times to vincristine and 25 times to doxorubicin in MDCK cells after transduction of pLNC-cMDR1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Transduction of canine mdr1 is an effective method for inducing chemoresistance in normal canine cells. This system may be applicable to the induction of drug resistance in hematopoietic cells.","['Matsuura, Shinobu', 'Koto, Hisao', 'Ide, Kaori', 'Fujino, Yasuhito', 'Setoguchi-Mukai, Asuka', 'Ohno, Koichi', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime']","['Matsuura S', 'Koto H', 'Ide K', 'Fujino Y', 'Setoguchi-Mukai A', 'Ohno K', 'Tsujimoto H']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dogs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transduction, Genetic/*veterinary', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.68.1.95 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2007 Jan;68(1):95-100. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.68.1.95.,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/DQ068953'],,,,,,,,,,

ANIMALS: 8 colostrum-deprived, BLV-negative Holstein bull calves (> or = 6 weeks old). PROCEDURES: Via IM injection, each calf received a fresh whole-blood inoculum (day 0) calculated to contain 2 x 10(6) lymphocytes. Blood samples for the ELISA and PCR assay were collected from calves immediately prior to inoculation and weekly thereafter for 7 weeks. Mean and median number of weeks to PCR-detected conversion of BLV status and seroconversion were calculated. Point sensitivity and cumulative sensitivity of the 2 assays were calculated at each sample collection. At each sampling time, the proportion of calves identified as infected by the cumulative weekly ELISA and PCR assay results was compared by use of a Fisher exact test. RESULTS: In 5 calves, conversion of BLV status was detected via PCR assay before seroconversion was identified. However, seroconversion preceded PCR-detected conversion in 2 calves. In 1 calf, both assays yielded positive results at the same test date. These differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In experimentally inoculated BLV-negative calves, conversion of BLV status was detected via PCR assay more quickly than via ELISA; this difference was not significant and probably not clinically important. The PCR assay may be useful as a confirmatory test in animals of exceptional value; tests based on viral identification may become critically important if vaccines against BLV infection are developed and marketed.","['Nagy, Dusty W', 'Tyler, Jeff W', 'Kleiboeker, Steven B']","['Nagy DW', 'Tyler JW', 'Kleiboeker SB']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/immunology/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*growth & development/immunology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Proviruses/genetics/*growth & development/immunology']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.68.1.72 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2007 Jan;68(1):72-5. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.68.1.72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the suppression of the proliferation of selected human cancer cells by phenolic compounds isolated from sweetpotato leaf. The human cancer cells used in this research included a stomach cancer (Kato III), a colon cancer (DLD-1), and a promyelocytic leukemia cell (HL-60). Caffeic acid and di- and tricaffeoylquinic acids dose-dependently depressed cancer cell proliferation, and the difference in sensitivity between caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and each kind of cancer cell was observed. Specifically, 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid effectively depressed the growth of three kinds of cancer cells, and caffeic acid had an exceptionally higher effect against HL-60 cells than other di- and tricaffeoylquinic acids. In attempting to clarify the mechanism of growth suppression with the addition of the apoptotic inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide, we observed that the nuclear granulation in 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid-treated HL-60 cells suggested apoptosis induction. This effect was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, an increase of caspase-3 activity, and expression of c-Jun. Growth suppression of HL-60 cells by 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid was determined to be the result of apoptotic death of the cells. These results indicate that 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid may have potential for cancer prevention.","['Kurata, Rie', 'Adachi, Masaru', 'Yamakawa, Osamu', 'Yoshimoto, Makoto']","['Kurata R', 'Adachi M', 'Yamakawa O', 'Yoshimoto M']","['Department of Upland Farming Research, National Agricultural Research Center for Kyushu Okinawa Region, Yokoichi 6651-2, Miyakonojo, Miyazaki 885-0091, Japan. rkurata@affrc.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ipomoea batatas/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Polyphenols', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms']",2007/01/04 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2007/01/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf0620259 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2007 Jan 10;55(1):185-90. doi: 10.1021/jf0620259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal dosage of genistein as single agent and in combination with ara-C was first determined in vitro. Genistein demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase. Gene-expression profiles revealed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling as one of the most affected biological pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, MAPK kinase 4, KIT, PIM1, and transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1, were significantly downregulated by genistein. To test whether genistein could augment the antiproliferation activity of ara-C, two groups of severe combined immunodeficient mice were inoculated with NB4 and HL-60 cells, respectively, followed by treatment with either genistein or combination of genistein and ara-C. The combination treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth, and improved survival of NB4 (p = 0.0031) and HL-60 (p = 0.0007) xenograft mice.

METHODS: In order to examine this issue, we developed a novel real-time quantitative allele-specific PCR, in which allelic discrimination is enhanced by the synergistic effect of a mismatch in the -1 position, and a locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleoside at the -2 position. RESULTS: Determination of allelic frequencies was reproducible (SD = 1.5%) and sensitive--0.1% mutant allele detected in 40 ng of DNA. The JAK2(V617F) frequency in clonal granulocytes from 3 PV females was less than 50% (27.5 +/- 11) and in 7 females greater than 50% (75 +/- 10.5). We also found that wild-type JAK2 BFU-E colonies from PV patients can grow without erythropoietin. The identification of the primary genetic lesion resulting in PV is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. CONCLUSION: Our studies correlating the frequency of JAK2(V617F) mutant allele and clonality, as well as the presence of homozygous wild-type JAK2 erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies, provide compelling evidence that the JAK2(V617F) is not the PV-initiating mutation. This supports a model wherein the JAK2(V617F) mutation arises as a secondary genetic event. Furthermore, our results indicate that an undefined molecular lesion, preceding JAK2(V617F), is responsible for clonal hematopoiesis in PV. We conclude that development of therapeutic strategies that target the JAK2(V617F) clonal cells may not be sufficient for eradication of PV.","['Nussenzveig, Roberto H', 'Swierczek, Sabina I', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Gaikwad, Amos', 'Liu, Enli', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Prchal, Jaroslav F', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Nussenzveig RH', 'Swierczek SI', 'Jelinek J', 'Gaikwad A', 'Liu E', 'Verstovsek S', 'Prchal JF', 'Prchal JT']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Probes/standards', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense/*physiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/*etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards']",2007/01/03 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/01/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00715-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jan;35(1):32-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.11.012.,"['1P01CA108671-O1A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-60445/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-050077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Methylcellulose progenitor assays using both unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) and purified CD34(+) progenitors were performed in atmospheric oxygen (18.6% O(2)) or one of two levels of hypoxia (1% and 3% O(2)). Assays were performed using normal donor marrow, MDS patient marrow, acute myelogenous leukemia marrow or peripheral blood blasts, chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) marrow MNCs, and blast crisis CML peripheral blood. RESULTS: The majority of MDS samples showed decreased colony-forming units (CFU) in 18.6% O(2) compared to normal controls, as expected. However, in either 1% or 3% O(2), 9 of 13 MDS samples demonstrated augmentation of CFUs beyond that observed in normal controls, with 6 of 13 demonstrating a greater than ninefold augmentation. This effect is cell autonomous, as it persisted after purification of CD34(+) progenitor cells. Additionally, the augmented response to physiologic oxygen tension is specific to MDS, as it was not observed in either acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia samples. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the reported decrease in MDS CFUs reflects greater sensitivity of MDS progenitors or their progeny to the nonphysiologic oxygen tensions routinely used in vitro, rather than a true decrease in progenitor frequency. Importantly, these experiments for the first time describe an experimental system that can be used to study the growth of primary cells from patients with MDS.","['Thompson, James Edwin', 'Conlon, Joseph Patrick', 'Yang, Xiaowei', 'Sanchez, Patricia Vanessa', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Thompson JE', 'Conlon JP', 'Yang X', 'Sanchez PV', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA. jamest@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*pathology', 'Oxygen']",2007/01/03 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/01/03 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00550-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jan;35(1):21-31. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.08.017.,"['T32 DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA129151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-HL73977/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL073977/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-DK07780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3677695,['NIHMS468509'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for curcumin-induced apoptosis is not well understood and most probably involves several pathways. In HL-60 cells, curcumin induced apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as evidenced by the survival molecules such as phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER-resident kinase, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha, glucose-regulated protein-78, and the apoptotic molecules such as caspase-4 and CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Inhibition of caspase-4 activity by z-LEVD-FMK, blockage of CHOP expression by small interfering RNA, and treatment with salubrinal, an ER inhibitor, significantly reduced curcumin-induced apoptosis. Removing two double bonds in curcumin, which was speculated to form Michael adducts with thiols in secretory proteins, resulted in a loss of the ability of curcumin to induce apoptosis as well as ER stress. Thus, the present study shows that curcumin-induced apoptosis is associated with its ability to cause ER stress.","['Pae, Hyun-Ock', 'Jeong, Sun-Oh', 'Jeong, Gil-Saeng', 'Kim, Ki Mo', 'Kim, Hak Sung', 'Kim, Soon-Ai', 'Kim, Youn-Chul', 'Kang, Sung-Don', 'Kim, Byeong-Nam', 'Chung, Hun-Taeg']","['Pae HO', 'Jeong SO', 'Jeong GS', 'Kim KM', 'Kim HS', 'Kim SA', 'Kim YC', 'Kang SD', 'Kim BN', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan 570-749, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '00U0645U03 (tetrahydrocurcumin)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases, Initiator)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases, Initiator/metabolism', 'Curcumin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2007/01/03 09:00,2007/04/11 09:00,['2007/01/03 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)02816-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Feb 23;353(4):1040-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.133.

METHODS: Clinical history and examination; slit-lamp photography; surgical intervention; laboratory evaluation including microbiology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, and cytopathology. RESULTS: A diagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy was performed. The vitreous aspirate was evaluated with microbiology; PCR for herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and cytomegalovirus; flow cytometry; and cytopathology. The patient received intravitreal antibiotics and antifungal and antiviral medication. The vitreous culture grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSION: Patients with GVHD are at risk for corneal ulcers with subsequent perforation. Commensal ocular flora may seed the vitreous and cause an endophthalmitis. Patients with GVHD may develop a vitritis from many causes including viral, fungal, and bacterial etiologies or a relapse of their original disease. When patients with GVHD present with vitritis, consideration should be given to obtaining a large vitreous aspirate to establish the etiology.","['Adrean, Sean D', 'Puklin, James E']","['Adrean SD', 'Puklin JE']","['Kresge Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Corneal Ulcer/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endophthalmitis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Eye Infections, Bacterial/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rupture, Spontaneous', 'Staphylococcal Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*isolation & purification', 'Vitreous Body/microbiology']",2007/01/02 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ico.0000240101.66652.36 [doi]', '00003226-200701000-00021 [pii]']",ppublish,Cornea. 2007 Jan;26(1):107-8. doi: 10.1097/01.ico.0000240101.66652.36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of bone marrow revealed that Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and bcr-abl fusion gene were positive. On the basis of these findings, the chronic phase of secondary chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was diagnosed. Three months after being started on imatinib therapy, Ph chromosome positive cells disappeared in the bone marrow, and a complete cytogenetic response was achieved.

We evaluated the role of polymorphisms in DNA repair genes APE1, XRCC1, ERCC1, XPD, and XRCC3 in predicting therapeutic outcomes of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from 2 Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical trials. All patients received standard chemotherapy induction regimens. Using logistic and proportional hazards regression models, relationships between genotypes, haplotypes, and toxicities, response to induction therapy, and overall survival were evaluated. Patients with XPD Gln751C/Asp312G ('D') haplotype were more likely to have complete response (OR = 3.06; 95% CI, 1.44-6.70) and less likely to have resistant disease (OR = 0.32; 95%CI, 0.14-0.72) than patients with other haplotypes.

However, whether oridonin can be used in the selected setting of hematology/oncology remains obscure. Here, we reported that oridonin induced apoptosis of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells. Intriguingly, the t(8;21) product AML1-ETO (AE) fusion protein, which plays a critical role in leukemogenesis, was degraded with generation of a catabolic fragment, while the expression pattern of AE target genes investigated could be reprogrammed. The ectopic expression of AE enhanced the apoptotic effect of oridonin in U937 cells. Preincubation with caspase inhibitors blocked oridonin-triggered cleavage of AE, while substitution of Ala for Asp at residues 188 in ETO moiety of the fusion abrogated AE degradation. Furthermore, oridonin prolonged lifespan of C57 mice bearing truncated AE-expressing leukemic cells without suppression of bone marrow or reduction of body weight of animals, and exerted synergic effects while combined with cytosine arabinoside. Oridonin also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice inoculated with t(8;21)-harboring Kasumi-1 cells.

We previously identified a C-terminal truncated AML1-ETO protein (AEtr) in a mouse leukemia model. AEtr is almost identical to the AML1-ETO exon 9a isoform expressed in leukemia patients. Here, we describe a novel function of AEtr in the development of aneuploidy through spindle checkpoint attenuation. AEtr cells had a reduced mitotic index following nocodazole treatment, suggesting a failure in a subset of cells to arrest in mitosis with a functional spindle checkpoint. Additionally, primary leukemia cells and cell lines expressing AEtr were aneuploid. Moreover, AEtr cells had reduced levels of several spindle checkpoint proteins including BubR1 and securin following treatment with the spindle poison nocodazole.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) may be pathogenic to humans, but are carried without ill effects by ruminants. We hypothesize that STEC have antiviral activity in ruminants, and showed previously that the non-toxic subunit A of Shiga toxin 1 (StxA1) acts selectively on cells infected with bovine leukemia virus, without harming normal cells, and that the numbers of intestinal STEC are inversely correlated with viral load in bovine leukemia virus-infected sheep. The purpose of the present study was to characterize StxA1 activity against a second bovine retrovirus, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). Flow cytometry showed that StxA1 treatment induced apoptosis in BIV-infected cells but not in uninfected cells and immunoblot analysis showed that StxA1 curtailed synthesis of Gag p26 protein. A systematic electron microscopy description of BIV infection in fetal bovine lung fibroblasts showed an orderly sequence of changes in cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, nucleus, and mitochondria, and suggested that the infected cells produce the virus within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). StxA1 interfered with all manifestations of BIV-induced transformation of infected cells into BIV-producing units. BIV-infected cells provided a suitable experimental system for investigation of the mechanism of Stx-antiviral activity.","['Ferens, Witold A', 'Hovde, Carolyn J']","['Ferens WA', 'Hovde CJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Biology, and Biochemistry, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844-3052, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/*drug effects/physiology', 'Shiga Toxin 1/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2007/01/02 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2006/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1702(06)00368-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2006.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2007 Apr;125(1):29-41. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2006.12.003.

METHODS: Participants included 140 parents of children diagnosed with pediatric leukemia. Informed consent conferences in which randomized clinical trials were discussed were observed, audiotaped, and coded for specific behaviors. Parents were also interviewed within 48 h of their participation in informed consent conferences. RESULTS: Observations revealed that 74% of cases included explanation of consent documents during consent conferences. Parents who reported that they read the consent document were more likely to understand differences between the clinical trial and off study therapy and were more likely to understand the right to withdraw. Reading of the consent document was not associated with understanding of voluntariness. In comparison to racial/ethnic majority parents, racial/ethnic minority parents were less likely to report that they read the consent document, understand voluntariness or the right to withdraw, and were less likely to be able to distinguish between the clinical trial and off study therapy. Low SES was associated with a lower probability of reading the consent document and being able to distinguish between clinical trials and off study therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Attention to the importance of reading the consent document and improving communication during consent conferences is likely to enhance understanding of essential elements of informed consent.","['Hazen, Rebecca A', 'Drotar, Dennis', 'Kodish, Eric']","['Hazen RA', 'Drotar D', 'Kodish E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital of University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106-6038, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Contemp Clin Trials,Contemporary clinical trials,101242342,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Consent Forms', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Parents/*education/psychology', 'Patient Rights', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Reading']",2007/01/02 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2006/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1551-7144(06)00150-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cct.2006.10.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Contemp Clin Trials. 2007 Jul;28(4):401-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2006.10.011.

The structures were established by spectroscopic analyses, NMR data comparisons with similar diterpenes, and chemical correlations. All the diterpenes are assumed to have the same absolute configuration as the co-occurring (+)-stachenol (4).

Recent studies have revealed that Wnt also exhibits activity similar to LIF. The molecular mechanism behind the maintenance of ES cells by these factors, however, is not fully understood. In this study, we found that LIF enhances level of nuclear beta-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Expression of an activated mutant of beta-catenin led to the long-term proliferation of ES cells, even in the absence of LIF. Furthermore, it was found that beta-catenin up-regulates Nanog in an Oct-3/4-dependent manner and that beta-catenin physically associates with Oct-3/4. These results suggest that up-regulating Nanog through interaction with Oct-3/4 involves beta-catenin in the LIF- and Wnt-mediated maintenance of ES cell self-renewal.","['Takao, Yukinari', 'Yokota, Takashi', 'Koide, Hiroshi']","['Takao Y', 'Yokota T', 'Koide H']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8640, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*physiology']",2007/01/02 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)02748-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.072 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Feb 16;353(3):699-705. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.072.
