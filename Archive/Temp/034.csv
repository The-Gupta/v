This pathway is also tightly associated with the development of several types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and acute promyelocytic leukemia, among many others. Inactivating mutations in Patched-1 (PTCH1), leading to ligand-independent pathway activation, are frequent in several cancer types, but most prominent in BCC. This has led to the development of several compounds targeting this pathway as a cancer therapeutic. These compounds target the inducers of this pathway in Smoothened (SMO) and the GLI transcription factors, although targeting SMO has had the most success. Despite the many attempts at targeting this pathway, only three US FDA-approved drugs for cancers affect the Shh pathway. Two of these compounds, vismodegib and sonidegib, target SMO to suppress signaling from either PTCH1 or SMO mutations that lead to upregulation of the pathway. The other approved compound is arsenic trioxide, which can suppress this pathway at the level of the GLI proteins, although current evidence suggests it also has other targets. This review focuses on the safety and tolerability of these clinically approved drugs targeting the Shh pathway, along with a discussion on other Shh pathway inhibitors being developed.","['Carpenter, Richard L', 'Ray, Haimanti']","['Carpenter RL', 'Ray H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9986-6493'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1001 E. 3rd St, Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA. richcarp@iu.edu.', 'Medical Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1001 E. 3rd St, Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA. richcarp@iu.edu.', 'Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, 535 Barnhill Dr., Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA. richcarp@iu.edu.', 'Medical Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1001 E. 3rd St, Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA.']",['eng'],['K22 CA207575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0RLU3VTK5M (sonidegib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biphenyl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myalgia/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Pyridines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology']",PMC6434684,['NIHMS1518888'],2019/01/17 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40264-018-0777-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40264-018-0777-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Drug Saf. 2019 Feb;42(2):263-279. doi: 10.1007/s40264-018-0777-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cases of IA, observed during consolidation in adult/paediatric patients with AML between 2011 and 2015, were retrospectively collected in a multicentre Italian study. RESULTS: Of 2588 patients, 56 (2.2%) developed IA [43 probable (1.7%) and 13 proven (0.5%)]. IA was diagnosed in 34 of 1137 (2.9%) patients receiving no AP and in 22 of 1451 (1.5%) who were given AP (P=0.01). Number-needed-to-treat calculation indicates that, on average, 71 patients should have received AP (instead of no AP) for one additional patient to not have IA. Initial antifungal therapy was 'pre-emptive' in 36 (64%) patients and 'targeted' in 20 (36%) patients. A good response to first-line therapy was observed in 26 (46%) patients, mainly those who received AP [16 of 22 (73%) versus 10 of 34 (29%); P=0.001]. The overall mortality rate and the mortality rate attributable to IA by day 120 were 16% and 9%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age >/=60 years (OR=12.46, 95% CI=1.13-136.73; P=0.03) and high-dose cytarabine treatment (OR=10.56, 95% CI=1.95-116.74; P=0.04) independently affected outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, AP appears to prevent IA from occurring during consolidation. However, although the incidence of IA was low, mortality was not negligible among older patients. Further prospective studies should be carried out particularly in elderly patients treated with high-dose cytarabine to confirm our data and to identify subsets of individuals who may require AP.","['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Dragonetti, Giulia', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Delia, Mario', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Farina, Francesca', 'Ballanti, Stelvio', 'Decembrino, Nunzia', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Orciulo, Enrico', 'Veggia, Barbara', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Manetta, Sara', 'Tumbarello, Mario', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Del Principe MI', 'Dragonetti G', 'Verga L', 'Candoni A', 'Marchesi F', 'Cattaneo C', 'Delia M', 'Potenza L', 'Farina F', 'Ballanti S', 'Decembrino N', 'Castagnola C', 'Nadali G', 'Fanci R', 'Orciulo E', 'Veggia B', 'Offidani M', 'Melillo L', 'Manetta S', 'Tumbarello M', 'Venditti A', 'Busca A', 'Aversa F', 'Pagano L']",,"[""Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita degli Studi di Roma 'Tor Vergata', Roma, Italy."", 'Istituto di Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

METHODS: Adult and pediatric patients (N = 7128) who underwent first HCT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome from 2008 through 2012 were analyzed as 3 groups-VRE BSI, non-VRE BSI, without BSI-according to BSI status at 100 days (D100) after allogeneic HCT. Multivariable models examined the effect of VRE BSI for overall survival (OS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year. RESULTS: Of 7128 patients, 258 (3.2%) had VRE BSI, 2398 (33.6%) had non-VRE BSI, and 4472 (63%) had no BSI. The median time to VRE BSI and non-VRE BSI were D11 and D15, respectively. Compared with non-VRE BSI patients, VRE BSI patients were older, had advanced-stage acute leukemia, and received umbilical cord blood (UCB) allografts. In multivariable models, VRE BSI was associated with lower OS (relative risk [RR], 2.9;(99% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-3.7) and increased NRM (RR, 4.7; 99% CI, 3.6-6.2) (P < .0001) for both. Other predictors for worse OS and increased NRM were non-VRE BSI, older age, advanced disease stage, UCB allograft, - mismatch, comorbidity index >/=3, and cytomegalovirus seropositivity (P < .001 for all variables). CONCLUSIONS: VRE BSI is associated with lowest OS and highest NRM compared with patients without BSI or non-VRE BSI. Novel interventions that address the pathophysiology of VRE BSI have the potential of improving survival after HCT.","['Papanicolaou, Genovefa A', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Young, Jo-Anne H', 'Chen, Min', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Woo Ahn, Kwang', 'Komanduri, Krishna', 'Lindemans, Caroline', 'Auletta, Jeffery J', 'Riches, Marcie L']","['Papanicolaou GA', 'Ustun C', 'Young JH', 'Chen M', 'Kim S', 'Woo Ahn K', 'Komanduri K', 'Lindemans C', 'Auletta JJ', 'Riches ML']",,"['Infectious Diseases Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Rush University Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'University of Miami, Florida.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University Medical Center, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.', ""Blood and Marrow Transplant Program and Host Defense Program, Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant and Infectious Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/*pathogenicity', 'Young Adult']",PMC6821199,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5289185 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciz031 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2019 Oct 30;69(10):1771-1779. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz031.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

The cardiomyopathy that develops from anthracyclines can lead to heart failure and decreased survival. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of anthracycline-induced heart failure. STUDY QUESTION: We hypothesize that anthracycline-induced cardiac (AIC) pathology can be monitored using a panel of blood biomarkers including high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) for myocyte necrosis and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for parietal stress. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, institutionally approved study recruited all patients with cancer scheduled to start anthracycline chemotherapy in the Transylvania University cancer clinics. MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: Transthoracic 2D echocardiography and the measurements of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT plasma levels were performed at the beginning of the study and 3 months and 6 months after anthracycline treatment initiation. RESULTS: The plasma levels of hs-cTnT at 3 months (rho = 0.439, P = 0.0001) and 6 months (rho = 0.490, P = 0.0001) are correlated with AIC occurrence. For a cutoff value of hs-cTnT at 3 months > 0.008 ng/mL, we obtained 66.7% sensitivity and 67.9% specificity for developing AIC at 6 months, with a 54.5% positive predictive value and a 87.8% negative predictive value. The NT-proBNP serum levels at 3 months (rho = 0.495, P = 0.0001) and 6 months (rho = 0.638, P = 0.0001) are correlated with an AIC diagnosis at 6 months. For a cutoff value of NT-proBNP at 3 months >118.5 pg/mL, we obtained 80% sensitivity and 79.2% specificity for evolution to AIC at 6 months, with 52.2% positive predictive value and 93.3% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: In anthracycline-treated cancer patients, the increase in plasma levels of NT-proBNP and of hs-cTnT can predict the development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Early identification of at-risk patients will potentially allow for targeted dose reductions and will diminish the number of patients developing cardiac pathology.","['Bisoc, Alina', 'Ciurescu, Daniel', 'Radoi, Mariana', 'Tantu, Monica M', 'Rogozea, Liliana', 'Sweidan, Alexander J', 'Bota, Daniela A']","['Bisoc A', 'Ciurescu D', 'Radoi M', 'Tantu MM', 'Rogozea L', 'Sweidan AJ', 'Bota DA']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Emergency County Clinical Hospital and Transilvania University, School of Medicine, Brasov, Romania.', 'Departments of Oncology and.', 'Cardiology, Transilvania University, School of Medicine, Brasov, Romania.', 'University of Pitesti, Faculty of Sciences, Physical Education and Informatics, Medical Assistance and Physical Therapy Department, Pitesti.', 'Department of Bioethics, Transilvania University, School of Medicine, Brasov, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine; and.', 'Neurology, Clinical Research, UC Irvine School of Medicine, Irvine, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ther,American journal of therapeutics,9441347,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (TNNT2 protein, human)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (prepro-brain natriuretic peptide)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cardiomyopathies/*blood/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Precursors/*blood', 'Stroke Volume', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Troponin T/*blood', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MJT.0000000000000930 [doi]', '00045391-202003000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Ther. 2020 Mar/Apr;27(2):e142-e150. doi: 10.1097/MJT.0000000000000930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 binds to IL-6R, forming a binary complex, which further combines with GP130 to transduce extracellular signaling by activating STAT3. Therefore, blocking the interaction between IL-6 and GP130 may inhibit the IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling pathway and its biological effects. It has been reported that bazedoxifene acetate (BAZ), a selective estrogen receptor modulator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, could inhibit IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interactions. Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, wound healing and colony formation assays were used to detect the effect of BAZ on liver cancer cells. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis of cells was determined using the Annexin V-FITC detection kit. Mouse xenograft tumor models were utilized to evaluate the effect of BAZ in vivo. Our data showed that BAZ inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (P-STAT3) and expression of STAT3 downstream genes, inducing apoptosis in liver cancer cells. BAZ inhibited P-STAT3 induced by IL-6, but not by leukemia inhibitory factor. BAZ inhibited P-STAT1 and P-STAT6 less significantly as elicited by interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma and IL-4. In addition, pretreatment of BAZ impeded the translocation of STAT3 to nuclei induced by IL-6. BAZ inhibited cell viability, wound healing and colony formation in vitro. Furthermore, tumor growth in HEPG2 mouse xenografts were significantly inhibited by daily intragastric gavage of BAZ. Our results suggest that BAZ inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo, indicating another potential strategy for HCC prevention and therapy.","['Ma, Haiyan', 'Yan, Dan',

Somatic GATA2(mut) in myeloid malignancies may impart a similar phenotype. We reviewed adult patients with a diagnosis of GATA2(mut) hematological malignancy who were referred to our HHMC for genetic testing, and identified to have somatic GATA2(mut). Nine patients with a median age of 63 years were included. Six patients (66.7%) were males. Atypical CML and acute myeloid leukemia were the most common initial presentation. The median overall VAF was 47.14%. Monocytopenia was pronounced when the GATA2(mut) involved the C-terminal ZFD. GATA2 N-terminal ZFD mutations tend to be co-mutated with biCEBPA(mut). Unlike germline GATA2 mutations, monocytopenia associated with somatic GATA2 mutations often resolved at remission. We concluded that similar to germline GATA2 mutations, a subset of somatic GATA2 mutations can impart a germline phenotype.","['Alfayez, Mansour', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Bannon, Sarah A', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Orange, Jordan S', 'Mace, Emily M', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Alfayez M', 'Wang SA', 'Bannon SA', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Kornblau SM', 'Orange JS', 'Mace EM', 'DiNardo CD']",,"['a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Hematopathology , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Clinical Cancer Genetics Program , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'd Department of Infectious Diseases , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'e Department of Pediatrics , Columbia University Medical Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'e Department of Pediatrics , Columbia University Medical Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],['R01 AI120989/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', '*Phenotype', 'Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1551535 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Aug;60(8):2025-2033. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1551535.

The creation of a catalog of LncRNAs expressed in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is thus of particular importance. However, this task is challenging as LncRNA expression is highly restricted in time and space manner and thus may greatly differ between samples. We performed a systematic transcript discovery in RNA-Seq data obtained from T-ALL primary cells and cell lines. This led to the identification of 2560 novel LncRNAs. After the integration of these transcripts into a large compendium of LncRNAs (n = 30478) containing both known LncRNAs and those previously described in T-ALLs, we then performed a systematic genomic and epigenetic characterization of these transcript models demonstrating that these novel LncRNAs share properties with known LncRNAs. Finally, we provide evidence that these novel transcripts could be enriched in LncRNAs with potential oncogenic effects and identified a subset of LncRNAs coregulated with T-ALL oncogenes. Overall, our study represents a comprehensive resource of LncRNAs expressed in T-ALL and might provide new cues on the role of lncRNAs in this type of leukemia.","['Kermezli, Yasmina', 'Saadi, Wiam', 'Belhocine, Mohamed', 'Mathieu, Eve-Lyne', 'Garibal, Marc-Antoine', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Aribi, Mourad', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Puthier, Denis']","['Kermezli Y', 'Saadi W', 'Belhocine M', 'Mathieu EL', 'Garibal MA', 'Asnafi V', 'Aribi M', 'Spicuglia S', 'Puthier D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8445-6360', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6255-5314', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9523-0658', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6522-7252', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6255-5314', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6522-7252', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8101-7108', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7240-5280']","['a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.', 'c Laboratory of Applied Molecular Biology and Immunology , W0414100, University of Tiemcen , Tiemcen , Algeria.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.', 'c Laboratory of Applied Molecular Biology and Immunology , W0414100, University of Tiemcen , Tiemcen , Algeria.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.', 'd Molecular Biology and Genetics Laboratory , Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'e Inserm, MMG , Aix Marseille University , Marseille , France.', 'f Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, and Laboratory of Onco-Haematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades , Paris , France.', 'c Laboratory of Applied Molecular Biology and Immunology , W0414100, University of Tiemcen , Tiemcen , Algeria.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.', 'a Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC , Marseille , France.', 'b Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer , Paris , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism']",,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1551534 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Aug;60(8):2002-2014. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1551534.

However, inhibition of MEK1/2, a key component of the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling cascade, results in paradoxical activation of AKT in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study we demonstrate synergy between the MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib and the AKT inhibitor MK2206, which combined induce apoptosis of primary CLL cells and restrict the cell cycle progression and proliferation of the OSU-CLL cell line. The mechanisms of action of the drug combination involve dual inhibition of MAPK-ERK1/2 and AKT signaling and down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that dual inhibition of MEK1/2 and AKT may represent a therapeutic option for CLL, capable of overcoming the pro-survival effects of the lymph node and bone marrow microenvironments.","['Shen, Yandong', 'Crassini, Kyle', 'Sandhu, Suneet', 'Fatima, Narjis', 'Christopherson, Richard I', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Best, O Giles']","['Shen Y', 'Crassini K', 'Sandhu S', 'Fatima N', 'Christopherson RI', 'Mulligan SP', 'Best OG']",,"['a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'b School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES) , University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW , Australia.', 'a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'b School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES) , University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW , Australia.', 'a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'b School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES) , University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW , Australia.', 'a Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute , Royal North Shore Hospital , St Leonards , NSW , Australia.', 'b School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES) , University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW , Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (MK 2206)', '181R97MR71 (binimetinib)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1542148 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jul;60(7):1632-1643. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1542148.

We report a unique and rare presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a child who presented with frontal swelling involving bilateral upper lids. A previously healthy one-year-old girl presented with progressively increasing frontal swelling of seven months duration. An examination revealed erythematous, firm, nontender forehead swelling that extended up to the medial part of bilateral upper eye lids. The extraocular muscle movement was normal. The anterior segment and fundus examination were also normal in both eyes. Other systemic examination revealed multiple leukemic cutis on the scalp. The cervical lymph nodes were also palpable with hepatosplenomegaly. A full blood picture (FBP) showed the presence of leucoerythroblastic blood film with 62% blast cells. Flow cytometry and bone marrow aspiration confirmed the diagnosis.

Mutations of its gene predominantly occur in two types of highly frequent benign tumors, uterine leiomyomas and fibroadenomas of the breast, where they apparently act as driver mutations. Nevertheless, their presence is not restricted to benign tumors having been found at considerable frequencies in uterine leiomyosarcomas, malignant phyllodes tumors, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia also. Most of the mutations are located within exon 2 of the gene but in rare cases the intron 1/exon 2 boundary or exon 1 are affected. As to their type, predominantly single nucleotide exchanges with a hotspot in one codon are found, but small deletions clustering around that hotspot also are not uncommon. These latter deletions are leaving the open reading frame intact. As to the types of mutations, so far no apparent differences between the tumor entities affected have emerged. Interestingly, this pattern with small deletions clustered around the hotspot of single nucleotide exchanges resembles that seen as a result of targeted gene editing. In contrast to other driver mutations the percentage of MED12-mutation positive tumors of independent clonal origin increases with the number of tumors per patient suggesting unknown etiological factors supporting site specific mutagenesis. These factors may act by inducing simultaneous site-specific double strand breaks the erroneous repair of which may lead to corresponding mutations. As inducers of DNA damage and its repair such as foreign nucleic acids of the microbiome displaying sequence homology to the putative target site might play a role. Interestingly, a 16 base pair homology of the hotspot to a putative terminator base-paired hairpin sequence of a Staphylococcus aureus tRNA gene cluster has been noted which might form R-loop like structures with its target sequence thus inducing said changes.","['Bullerdiek, Jorn', 'Rommel, Birgit']","['Bullerdiek J', 'Rommel B']",,"['Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical Center, University of Rostock, Rostock, D-18057, Germany.', 'Human Genetics, University of Bremen, Bremen, D-28359 , Germany.', 'Human Genetics, University of Bremen, Bremen, D-28359 , Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,"['0 (MED12 protein, human)', '0 (Mediator Complex)']",,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mediator Complex/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']",PMC6325618,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.14227.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2018 Mar 22;7:359. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.14227.2. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA-RNA hybrids', '*Mediator subcomplex 12 (MED12)', '*Staphylococcus aureus', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*fibroadenomas of the breast', '*multiple tumors', '*mutations', '*uterine leiomyomas']",,,20180322,,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore whether Axl is an effective target in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, we analyzed CLL B-cells obtained from CLL patients on ibrutinib therapy. Ibrutinib-exposed CLL B-cells were treated with increasing doses (0.01- 0.50muM) of a new formulation of high-affinity Axl inhibitor, TP-0903 (tartrate salt), for 24 hours and LD50 doses were determined. Sensitivity of CLL B-cells was compared with known prognostic factors and effect of TP-0903 was also evaluated on Axl signaling pathway in CLL B-cells from this cohort. We detected sustained overexpression of Axl in CLL B-cells from CLL patients on ibrutinib treatment, suggests targeting Axl could be a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance and killing of CLL B-cells in these patients. We found that CLL B-cells from sixty-nine percent of relapsed CLL patients actively on ibrutinib therapy were found to be highly sensitive to TP-0903 with induction of apoptosis at nanomolar doses (</=0.50 muM). TP-0903 treatment effectively inhibited Axl phosphorylation and reduced expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, XIAP) in ibrutinib exposed CLL B-cells.

The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with AML was 27.4% between 2008 and 2014. The standard induction for patients with AML includes cytarabine, infused for 7 days, with 3 once-daily injections of an anthracycline, such as daunorubicin, known as the 7+3 regimen. Daunorubicin plus cytarabine liposomal encapsulation for injection was approved in the United States in 2017 for adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related AML (tAML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Objective: To estimate the annual budget impact of introducing daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome as induction treatment for patients with tAML or AML-MRC in the United States over a 3-year period. Methods: The model consisted of a simple decision analytic framework for a 1- to 3-year period. We used an incidence-based approach to estimate the annual number of patients newly diagnosed with tAML or AML-MRC in a hypothetical 1-million-member plan. Patients were allocated to 2 groups based on when daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome became available, with the base-case group allocated to the 7+3 regimen, and another group allocated to daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome treatment. The incidence of AML was estimated as 4.3 per 100,000 people. Efficacy measures included the proportion of complete responders, proportion of patients who had undergone transplantation, and survival at 180 and 365 days. Inpatient drug and hospitalization costs were based on diagnosis-related group rates, and outpatient drug costs on wholesale acquisition costs. Results: Based on this hypothetical 1-million-member health plan, 15.1 members would receive intensive induction for newly diagnosed tAML or AML-MRC annually. Increasing the use of daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome (assumption of year 1, 20%; year 2, 50%; year 3, 80%) resulted in a 3-year incremental cumulative budget impact of $72,041 (1.7% increase for patients with tAML or AML-MRC), with a per-member per-month cost of $0.0032 at year 3. Over a 3-year period, the use of daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome would result in an estimated increase in the number of patients with a complete response to therapy by 2.72 (23.1%), which would lead to an incremental cost decrease of $179,956 per responding patient compared with the use of the 7+3 regimen in the base-case group. Conclusions: Based on these results, induction treatment with daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome for patients with tAML or AML-MRC instead of the 7+3 regimen may have a limited economic impact on the budget of commercial health plans and may result in cost offsets, particularly in patients who respond to therapy.","['Jensen, Ivar S', 'Wu, Elizabeth', 'Sacks, Naomi C', 'Cyr, Philip L', 'Chung, Karen C']","['Jensen IS', 'Wu E', 'Sacks NC', 'Cyr PL', 'Chung KC']",,"['Director, Evidence Strategy & Generation, Precision Xtract, Boston, MA.', 'Health Economist, Evidence Strategy & Generation, Precision Xtract.', 'Director, Evidence Strategy & Generation, Precision Xtract, and Adjunct Professor, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston.', 'Vice President, Evidence Strategy & Generation, Precision Xtract, and Research Faculty, University of North Carolina, Charlotte.', 'Director, Health Economics & Outcomes Research, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA, during the study.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am Health Drug Benefits,American health & drug benefits,101479877,,,,PMC6306103,,2019/01/17 06:00,2019/01/17 06:01,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/17 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am Health Drug Benefits. 2018 Oct;11(7):380-386.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['7+3 regimen', 'AML with myelodysplasia-related changes', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'budget impact', 'daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome', 'incremental cost', 'tAML', 'therapy-related AML']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrolide antibiotics are effective against gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They have anti-inflammatory activities as well. Clarithromycin is a macrolide with anti-inflammatory activity through blockage of the p38 MAPK signal cascade, which is involved in methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity. Aim: In this study, the efficacy of clarithromycin in protecting against pulmonary fibrosis was investigated in the rat model for methotrexate-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Material and methods: A total of 30 female rats were divided into three groups. Group I was administered intraperitoneal and intragastric saline; group II was administered oral 3 mg/kg methotrexate; and group III was administered oral 3 mg/kg methotrexate + intraperitoneal 200 mg/kg clarithromycin for 28 days. Histopathological analyses of the lung tissues were performed under light microscopy. Results: Normal histopathological changes were observed in the control group. Pulmonary fibrosis was significantly higher in the methotrexate group than in the other groups (p < 0.005).

BETi treatment induces apoptosis of AML BPCs, reduces in vivo AML burden and induces clinical remissions in a minority of AML patients. Clinical efficacy of more potent BETis, e.g., ABBV-075 (AbbVie, Inc.), is being evaluated. Venetoclax and A-1210477 bind and inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of BCL2 and MCL1, respectively, lowering the threshold for apoptosis. BETi treatment is shown here to perturb accessible chromatin and activity of enhancers/promoters, attenuating MYC, CDK6, MCL1 and BCL2, while inducing BIM, HEXIM1, CDKN1A expressions and apoptosis of AML cells. Treatment with venetoclax increased MCL1 protein levels, but cotreatment with ABBV-075 reduced MCL1 and Bcl-xL levels. ABBV-075 cotreatment synergistically induced apoptosis with venetoclax or A-1210477 in patient-derived, CD34+ AML cells. Compared to treatment with either agent alone, cotreatment with ABBV-075 and venetoclax was significantly more effective in reducing AML cell-burden and improving survival, without inducing toxicity, in AML-engrafted immune-depleted mice. These findings highlight the basis of superior activity and support interrogation of clinical efficacy and safety of cotreatment with BETi and BCL2 or MCL1 inhibitor in AML.","['Fiskus, Warren', 'Cai, Tianyu', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Rajapakshe, Kimal', 'Perera, Dimuthu', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Mill, Christopher P', 'Saenz, Dyana T', 'Saenz, David N', 'Sun, Baohua', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Shen, Yu', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Fiskus W', 'Cai T', 'DiNardo CD', 'Kornblau SM', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia TM', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Bose P', 'Masarova L', 'Rajapakshe K', 'Perera D', 'Coarfa C', 'Mill CP', 'Saenz DT', 'Saenz DN', 'Sun B', 'Khoury JD', 'Shen Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Bhalla KN']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2621-3584']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. kbhalla@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA171338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (A-1210477)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein, human)', 'VR86R11J7J (mivebresib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6333829,,2019/01/17 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-018-0165-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-018-0165-5 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Jan 15;9(2):4. doi: 10.1038/s41408-018-0165-5.,,,,,,,,20190115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, through fucosylation, a process whereby fucosyltransferases (FT) add fucose groups to cell surface glycoproteins, this challenge may be overcome. Endogenously fucosylated CTLs and ex vivo fucosylated cord blood stem cells and regulatory T cells were shown to preferentially home to inflamed tissues and marrow. Here, we show a novel approach to enhance CTL homing to leukemic marrow and tumor tissue. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using the enzyme FT-VII, we fucosylated CTLs that target the HLA-A2-restricted leukemia antigens CG1 and PR1, the HER2-derived breast cancer antigen E75, and the melanoma antigen gp-100. We performed in vitro homing assays to study the effects of fucosylation on CTL homing and target killing. We used in vivo mouse models to demonstrate the effects of ex vivo fucosylation on CTL antitumor activities against leukemia, breast cancer, and melanoma. RESULTS: Our data show that fucosylation increases in vitro homing and cytotoxicity of antigen-specific CTLs. Furthermore, fucosylation enhances in vivo CTL homing to leukemic bone marrow, breast cancer, and melanoma tissue in NOD/SCID gamma (NSG) and immunocompetent mice, ultimately boosting the antitumor activity of the antigen-specific CTLs. Importantly, our work demonstrates that fucosylation does not interfere with CTL specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data establish ex vivo CTL fucosylation as a novel approach to improving the efficacy of ACT, which may be of great value for the future of ACT for cancer.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Qiao, Na', 'Zhang, Mao', 'Zope, Madhushree', 'Perakis, Alexander A', 'Sukhumalchandra, Pariya', 'Philips, Anne V', 'Garber, Haven R', 'Kerros, Celine', 'St John, Lisa S', 'Khouri, Maria R', 'Khong, Hiep', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Miller, Leonard P', 'Wolpe, Steve', 'Overwijk, Willem W', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Ma, Qing', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Mittendorf, Elizabeth A']","['Alatrash G', 'Qiao N', 'Zhang M', 'Zope M', 'Perakis AA', 'Sukhumalchandra P', 'Philips AV', 'Garber HR', 'Kerros C', 'St John LS', 'Khouri MR', 'Khong H', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Miller LP', 'Wolpe S', 'Overwijk WW', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Ma Q', 'Shpall EJ', 'Mittendorf EA']",,"['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. galatras@mdanderson.org emittendorf@bwh.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Targazyme Inc., Carlsbad, California.', 'Targazyme Inc., Carlsbad, California.', 'Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Surgical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts. galatras@mdanderson.org emittendorf@bwh.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA224285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration']",PMC6467811,['NIHMS1518709'],2019/01/17 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-1527 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1527 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 15;25(8):2610-2620. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1527.

These receptors recognize cognate HLA class I molecules on potential target cells, and recent studies imply that an HLA-B dimorphism at position -21 in the gene segment encoding the leader peptide dictates whether NK cell regulation primarily relies on the KIRs or the NKG2A/CD94 receptor. The impact of this HLA-B dimorphism on NK cell-mediated destruction of leukemic cells or on the course of leukemia is largely unknown. In a first part of this study, we compared functions of NK cells in subjects carrying HLA-B -21M or 21T using interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated NK cells and leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Subjects carrying HLA-B -21M harbored better-educated NKG2A(+) NK cells and displayed superior capacity to degranulate lytic granules against KIR ligand-matched primary leukemic blasts. Second, we aimed to define the potential impact of HLA-B -21 variation on the course of AML in a phase 4 trial in which patients received IL-2-based immunotherapy. In keeping with the hypothesis that 21M may be associated with improved NK cell functionality, we observed superior leukemia-free survival and overall survival in -21M patients than in -21T patients during IL-2-based immunotherapy. We propose that genetic variation at HLA-B -21 may determine the antileukemic efficacy of activated NK cells and the clinical benefit of NK cell-activating immunotherapy.","['Hallner, Alexander', 'Bernson, Elin', 'Hussein, Brwa Ali', 'Ewald Sander, Frida', 'Brune, Mats', 'Aurelius, Johan', 'Martner, Anna', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Thoren, Fredrik B']","['Hallner A', 'Bernson E', 'Hussein BA', 'Ewald Sander F', 'Brune M', 'Aurelius J', 'Martner A', 'Hellstrand K', 'Thoren FB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4973-5097', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6414-5725', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6598-5221', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6617-5976', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2167-7451']","['TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.', 'TIMM Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center and.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B21 antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/immunology', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",PMC6440292,,2019/01/17 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42670-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-09-874990 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 28;133(13):1479-1488. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-09-874990.

This update reports on the eligibility criteria expansion and on the adjunction of a cost-utility analysis. We widened the eligible population to patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer including malignant hemopathies (except acute myeloid leukemia) and to patients in the first and second lines of oncologic treatment. We restricted the inclusion to patients with a Mini Mental State Examination score strictly over 24. In addition to the secondary outcomes outlined in the protocol, a medico-economic analysis has been added to evaluate both the health benefits and costs of the two strategies and calculate the incremental cost-utility ratio of the innovative program assessed, compared to the standard practice.

CRS can be caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) that may reach nasopharynx. The major component of refluxate, bile acid (BA) has been found to be carcinogenic and genotoxic. BA-induced apoptosis has been associated with various cancers. We have previously demonstrated that BA induced apoptosis and gene cleavages in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Chromosomal cleavage occurs at the early stage of both apoptosis and chromosome rearrangement. It was suggested that chromosome breaks tend to cluster in the region containing matrix association region/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR). This study hypothesised that BA may cause chromosome breaks at MAR/SAR leading to chromosome aberrations in NPC. This study targeted the AF9 gene located at 9p22 because 9p22 is a deletion hotspot in NPC. METHODS: Potential MAR/SAR sites were predicted in the AF9 gene by using MAR/SAR prediction tools. Normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NP69) and NPC cells (TWO4) were treated with BA at neutral and acidic pH. Inverse-PCR (IPCR) was used to identify chromosome breaks in SAR region (contains MAR/SAR) and non-SAR region (does not contain MAR/SAR). To map the chromosomal breakpoints within the AF9 SAR and non-SAR regions, DNA sequencing was performed. RESULTS: In the AF9 SAR region, the gene cleavage frequencies of BA-treated NP69 and TWO4 cells were significantly higher than those of untreated control. As for the AF9 non-SAR region, no significant difference in cleavage frequency was detected between untreated and BA-treated cells. A few breakpoints detected in the SAR region were mapped within the AF9 region that was previously reported to translocate with the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene in an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MAR/SAR may be involved in defining the positions of chromosomal breakages induced by BA. Our report here, for the first time, unravelled the relation of these BA-induced chromosomal breakages to the AF9 chromatin structure.","['Tan, Sang-Nee', 'Sim, Sai-Peng']","['Tan SN', 'Sim SP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0256-2803'],"['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia. spsim@unimas.my.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Breakage/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nasopharynx/*cytology', 'Nuclear Matrix/drug effects/*metabolism']",PMC6334432,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-018-0465-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-018-0465-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Jan 15;12(1):9. doi: 10.1186/s12920-018-0465-4.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AF9', '*Apoptosis', '*Bile acid', '*Chronic rhinosinusitis', '*Gastro-oesophageal reflux', '*Matrix association region/scaffold attachment region', '*Nasopharyngeal carcinoma']",,,20190115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expressed genes contribute to the development and progression of T-ALL. However, the regulation underlying their aberrant expression remains elusive. Dysregulated expression of transcription factors and miRNAs played important regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the alteration of transcriptome profiling and regulatory networks between T-ALL sample and normal T cell samples at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that genes related to cell cycle and cell proliferation processes were significantly upregulated in T-ALL comparing to normal samples. Meanwhile, regulatory network analyses revealed that FOXM1, MYB, SOX4 and miR-21/19b as core regulators played vital roles in the development of T-ALL. FOXM1-miR-21-5p-CDC25A and MYB/SOX4-miR-19b-3p-RBBP8 were identified as important feed-forward loops involved in the oncogenesis of T-ALL. Drug-specific analyses showed that GSK-J4 may be an effective drug, and CDC25A/CAPN2/MCM2 could serve as potential therapeutic targets for T-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide novel insights for the regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of T-ALL and potential therapeutic targets.","['Xia, Mengxuan', 'Zhang, Qiong', 'Luo, Mei', 'Li, Pan', 'Wang, Yingxue', 'Lei, Qian', 'Guo, An-Yuan']","['Xia M', 'Zhang Q', 'Luo M', 'Li P', 'Wang Y', 'Lei Q', 'Guo AY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5099-7465'],"['Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250033, Shandong, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China. leiqian@hust.edu.cn.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China. guoay@mail.hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",PMC6332896,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-018-0469-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-018-0469-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Jan 15;12(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s12920-018-0469-0.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell cycle', '*Cell proliferation', '*Feed-forward loops', '*Pathogenesis', '*T-ALL']",,,20190115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper highlights the subjective perspectives of pediatric cancer patients and specifically explores how experiencing cancer at a young age impacts adolescents in the areas of social functioning, peer relationships, and QOL. The findings emerged from a qualitative research study that explored how pediatric oncology patients ascribe meaning to their illness. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from four Canadian academic pediatric hospitals. In this study, we used an interpretative description approach. Semistructured interviews were completed, transcribed verbatim, and coded through the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: A total of 37 children and adolescents (n = 19 female; 51%) participated. The majority of participants were diagnosed with leukemia (n = 16; 43%) or lymphoma (n = 9; 24%). Sixty-two percent of participants were adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years (n = 23). Data illustrated a unique adolescent experience, which has been reported as a subset of the original population. Adolescent participants noted an accelerated experience of maturation, which invited reflections of gratitude as well as feelings of isolation and disconnect from peers. Participants were saddened to have ""missed out"" on normative parts of childhood. CONCLUSION: Findings highlighted experiences of accelerated maturity that prompted adverse social outcomes for adolescent participants, which impacted their QOL. Future research is needed to explore the intersection of accelerated maturity attributed to illness, social functioning, and QOL. Peer support through technology engagement is suggested for this population.","['Anthony, Samantha J', 'Robertson, Taylor', 'Selkirk, Enid', 'Dix, David', 'Klaassen, Robert J', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Klassen, Anne F']","['Anthony SJ', 'Robertson T', 'Selkirk E', 'Dix D', 'Klaassen RJ', 'Sung L', 'Klassen AF']",,"['Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children/Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children/Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'School of Rehabilitation Science, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics Hem/Onc/BMT, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada."", 'Division of Haematology-Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Peer Group', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Concept', '*Social Adjustment', 'Social Change', '*Social Support']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4982 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2019 Mar;28(3):586-592. doi: 10.1002/pon.4982.

The public's attitude toward postrandomization consent trials is unknown, but the way the trials are described could bias people's views. Objectives: To assess the attitudes of the US general public toward postrandomization informed consent for pragmatic trials and to measure potential framing and other factors associated with those attitudes. Design, Setting, and Participants: An online, 2 x 2 experimental survey (fielded between February 23 and April 3, 2018) portraying 4 scenarios of postrandomization informed consent (with prior broad consent for medical record use) was conducted. These scenarios included traditional randomized clinical trial language framing vs alternative framing in a high-stakes trial (ie, survival in leukemia) or low-stakes trial (ie, blood glucose level in diabetes). A total of 3793 individuals invited to participate were part of an existing panel representative of the US general public (GfK KnowledgePanel). Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of participants who would recommend that an ethics review board approve a postrandomization consent pragmatic trial. Results: A total of 2042 of 3739 invitees (54.6%) responded; after exclusion of 38 incomplete surveys, 2004 participants were included in the analysis. Of these, 997 (49.8%) were women, 1440 (71.9%) were white non-Hispanic, 199 (9.9%) were black non-Hispanic, and 233 (11.6%) were Hispanic. Mean (SD) age was 47.5 (17.4) years. Across scenarios, weighted data showed that 75.4% of the participants would recommend approval of the postrandomization consent pragmatic trial, 20.4% would probably not recommend approval, and 4.2% would definitely not recommend approval. Approval was not sensitive to framing language (traditional vs new framing in high-stakes scenario, 74.3% vs 76.8%, P = .40; in low-stakes scenario, 77.7% vs 72.9%, P = .10) or to the stakes (low vs high stakes in traditional framing, 77.7% vs 74.3%, P = .25; in new framing, 72.9% vs 76.8%, P = .18). Better understanding of the postrandomization consent design was associated with higher rate of approval (78.1% vs 65.0%, P = .002 for high-stakes scenario; 77.2% vs 64.9%, P = .004 for low-stakes scenario), especially among those with less education. However, opinions about personal involvement in the control arm were more cautious (range depending on scenario, 45.6%-59.7%) and sensitive to stakes but not to framing. Conclusions and Relevance: The public's generally high rate of approval of the ethics of postrandomization informed consent for pragmatic trial designs does not appear to be affected by whether postrandomization consent design is framed using traditional randomized clinical trial terminology, regardless of the stakes of the trial. Promoting better understanding of the design may increase its acceptance by the public.","['Miller, David Gibbes', 'Kim, Scott Y H', 'Li, Xiaobai', 'Dickert, Neal W', 'Flory, James', 'Runge, Carlisle P', 'Relton, Clare']","['Miller DG', 'Kim SYH', 'Li X', 'Dickert NW', 'Flory J', 'Runge CP', 'Relton C']",,"['Department of Bioethics, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Bioethics, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology Service, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Endocrinology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Bioethics, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Public Health Section, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['K08 HS023898/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crowdsourcing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic/*ethics/*psychology', 'Public Opinion']",PMC6324565,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/10/02 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['2719134 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6149 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2018 Dec 7;1(8):e186149. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6149.,,,,,,,,20181207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adolescents and young adults with cancer are at risk for several therapy-related late effects; however, these have not been studied extensively. Objective: To investigate the lifetime risks of endocrine late effects of cancer and cancer treatment in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This Danish, nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2009, and included follow-up from January 1, 1977, through December 31, 2010. A total of 32548 one-year cancer survivors diagnosed at ages 15 to 39 years were identified using the Danish Cancer Registry and 188728 cancer-free comparison participants matched by year of birth and sex were randomly chosen from the Danish Civil Registration system. Analyses were performed from July 3, 2015, to February 27, 2018. Exposures: Individuals in the survivor cohort were diagnosed with a first primary cancer at ages 15 to 39 years and received treatment according to recommendations and guidelines at time of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: By linkage to the National Patient Register, all hospital contacts for endocrine diseases were identified, and standardized hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. Results: A total of 32548 adolescent and young adult 1-year cancer survivors (14021 [43.1%] male) in the Danish Patient Registry were followed up for 379157 person-years (median [range]: 10 [0-34] years) and 188728 cancer-free participants (82669 [43.8%] male) for comparison were followed up for 2958994 person-years (median [range]: 15 [0-34] years). A total of 2129 survivors (6.5%) had at least 1 hospital contact for an endocrine disease, while 1232.0 (3.8%) were expected, yielding a statistically significant increased RR of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.65-1.81). The RRs were highest for testicular hypofunction (75.12; 95% CI, 45.99-122.70), ovarian hypofunction (14.65; 95% CI, 8.29-25.86), and pituitary hypofunction (11.14; 95% CI, 8.09-15.34). The leading reasons for hospital contacts were thyroid disease (38.0% of total AER), testicular dysfunction (17.1% of total AER), and diabetes (14.4% of total AER). Leukemia survivors were at a high risk for any endocrine disease (RR, 3.97; 95% CI, 3.10-5.09), while Hodgkin lymphoma survivors (RR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.62-3.57) had the highest disease-specific excess risk for hypothyroidism (AER, 362 per 100000 person-years; 95% CI, 280-443 per 100000 person-years). Conclusions and Relevance: The increased risk for endocrine diseases in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors indicates the need for counseling and follow-up, and could guide future preventive measures and surveillance strategies. Additional studies are required to determine exact associations between treatment regimens and endocrine diseases.","['Jensen, Mette Vestergaard', 'Rugbjerg, Kathrine', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Johansen, Christoffer', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Andersen, Klaus Kaae', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck']","['Jensen MV', 'Rugbjerg K', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Johansen C', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Andersen KK', 'Winther JF']",,"['Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Statistics, Bioinformatics, and Registries, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Endocrine System Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6324403,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['2686037 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0349 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2018 Jun 1;1(2):e180349. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0349.,,,"['Cancer. 2018 Dec 15;124(24):4591.

Marrow fibrosis and transformation to acute leukaemia can also occur after several years. Treatment is based on phlebotomy and aspirin at low (antiplatelet) doses, sometimes combined with hydroxycarbamide, a cytotoxic drug. Various other drugs are available if hydroxycarbamide fails or is poorly tolerated, but there is no consensus treatment. Ruxolitinib inhibits Janus tyrosine kinases, which are involved, among other roles, in haematopoiesis. Ruxolitinib has been authorised in the European Union for patients with polycythaemia vera in whom hydroxycarbamide has failed or is poorly tolerated. Clinical evaluation of ruxolitinib in this setting is based on a randomised, unblinded trial versus treatment chosen by the investigators, in 222 patients treated for 32 weeks. Hydroxycarbamide was chosen in 59% of cases, even though the patients had unacceptable adverse effects or an inadequate response to the drug. The efficacy of the investigators' other treatment choices was uncertain. Phlebotomy was less frequent in the ruxofitinib group than in the control group. The adverse effects of ruxotitinib in this situation are poorly documented, due to inadequate long-term assessment. In the short term, ruxolitinib causes anaemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as bleeding, potentially severe infections, headache, sensory disturbances, and weight gain. It is also likely to share the serious adverse effects of other immunosuppressants. Ruxolitinib is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, creating a risk of multiple drug interactions. Ruxolitinib showed embryofetal toxicity in animal studies. Virtually no data are available in pregnant women. In practice, available data on the harm-benefit balance of ruxolitinib fail to show that this drug represents a tangible advance for patients with polycythaemia vera, as compared with other drugs used when hydroxycarbamide is unsuitable.",,,,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],France,Prescrire Int,Prescrire international,9439295,"['0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",,"['Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Nitriles', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/10/01 00:00,2016/10/01 00:01,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Prescrire Int. 2016 Oct;25(175):229-231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Exposure, efficacy and safety data from adult patients (n = 646) with r/r ALL receiving stepwise (9 then 28 mug/day, 4-week cycle) continuous intravenous infusion (n = 537) of blinatumomab or SOC (n = 109) chemotherapy were pooled from phase 2 and 3 studies. The occurrence of CR, neurological and CRS events, and duration of OS were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models or logistic regression, as appropriate. Confounding factors were tested multivariately as needed. RESULTS: Blinatumomab steady-state concentration following 28 mug/day dosing was associated with the probability of achieving CR (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 1.073 [1.033-1.114]), and a longer duration of OS compared to SOC (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.954 [0.936-0.973], P < .05) in multivariate analyses. The exposure-safety analyses indicated that blinatumomab steady-state concentration following the 9 or 28 mug/day dose was not associated with increased probability of CRS or neurological events, after accounting for blinatumomab treatment effect (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab step-dosing regimen of 9/28 mug/day provided treatment benefit in achieving CR and increasing the duration of OS over SOC and was appropriate in management of CRS and neurological events in patients with r/r ALL.","['Kuchimanchi, Mita', 'Zhu, Min', 'Clements, John D', 'Doshi, Sameer']","['Kuchimanchi M', 'Zhu M', 'Clements JD', 'Doshi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0349-7756', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5669-9602', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5744-3249', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3843-8097']","['Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling and Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling and Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling and Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling and Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Standard of Care', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6422642,,2019/01/16 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.13864 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Apr;85(4):807-817. doi: 10.1111/bcp.13864.

However, lifelong TKI therapy is associated with reduced quality of life and significant economic burden. Currently, the management of CML is shifting from continuous TKI therapy towards the goal of TKI cessation which is discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies in the last decade have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of TKI discontinuation in selected patients with CML who achieve deep and sustained molecular response with TKI. This has moved prime-time into clinical practice although open questions remain in terms of understanding the disease biology that leads to successful TKI cessation in some patients while not in others. Cessation of TKI for CML patients is a feasible approach. Ongoing research aims to find out optimal strategies to sustain ongoing treatment-free remission (TFR) and increase the number of patients who achieve TFR.","['Guru Murthy, Guru Subramanian', 'Atallah, Ehab']","['Guru Murthy GS', 'Atallah E']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA. gmurthy@mcw.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/*methods']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-0496-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-0496-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Feb;14(1):56-61. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-0496-8.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic', '*Discontinuation', '*Leukemia', '*Myeloid', '*Treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOXA9, implicated in acute myeloid leukemia, is one of them. To date, only indirect targeting of HOXA9 expression or multitarget HOX/PBX protein/protein interaction inhibitors has been developed. As an attractive alternative by inhibiting the DNA binding, we selected a series of heterocyclic diamidines as efficient competitors for the HOXA9/DNA interaction through binding as minor groove DNA ligands on the HOXA9 cognate sequence. Selected DB818 and DB1055 compounds altered HOXA9-mediated transcription in luciferase assays, cell survival, and cell cycle, but increased cell death and granulocyte/monocyte differentiation, two main HOXA9 functions also highlighted using transcriptomic analysis of DB818-treated murine Hoxa9-transformed hematopoietic cells. Altogether, these data demonstrate for the first time the propensity of sequence-selective DNA ligands to inhibit HOXA9/DNA binding both in vitro and in a murine Hoxa9-dependent leukemic cell

Derived from the emerging clinical demands, there is an urgent need for a cytokine immunoassay that offers unprecedented sensor performance with high sensitivity, throughput, and multiplexing capability, as well as short turnaround time at low system complexity, manufacturability, and scalability. In this paper, a label-free, high throughput cytokine immunoassay based on a magnet patterned Fe3 O4 /Au core-shell nanoparticle (FACSNP) sensing array is developed. By exploiting the unique superparamagnetic and plasmonic properties of the core-shell nanomaterials, a facile microarray patterning technique is established that allows the fabrication of a uniform, self-assembled microarray on a large surface area with remarkable tunability and scalability. The sensing performance of the FACSNP microarray is validated by real-time detection of four cytokines in complex biological samples, showing high sensitivity ( approximately 20 pg mL(-1) ), selectivity and throughput with excellent statistical accuracy. The developed immunoassay is successfully applied for rapid determination of the functional immunophenotype of leukemia tumor-associated macrophages, manifesting its potential clinical applications for real-time immune monitoring, early cancer detection, and therapeutic drug stratification toward personalized medicine.","['Cai, Yuxin', 'Zhu, Jingyi', 'He, Jiacheng', 'Yang, Wen', 'Ma, Chao', 'Xiong, Feng', 'Li, Feng', 'Chen, Weiqiang', 'Chen, Pengyu']","['Cai Y', 'Zhu J', 'He J', 'Yang W', 'Ma C', 'Xiong F', 'Li F', 'Chen W', 'Chen P']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3380-872X'],"['Materials Research and Education Center, Materials Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, 11201, USA.', 'Materials Research and Education Center, Materials Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.', 'Materials Research and Education Center, Materials Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, 11201, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, 11201, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, 11201, USA.', 'Materials Research and Education Center, Materials Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.']",['eng'],"['R21 EB025406/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', '1701322/National Science Foundation/International', '1701363/National Science Foundation/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Adv Healthc Mater,Advanced healthcare materials,101581613,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*analysis', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Immunoassay', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Mice', '*Protein Array Analysis', 'RAW 264.7 Cells']",PMC6486820,['NIHMS1024545'],2019/01/16 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/adhm.201801478 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Healthc Mater. 2019 Feb;8(4):e1801478. doi: 10.1002/adhm.201801478.

The latter is capable to mediate fast activation of cytosolic signaling pathways, influencing transcriptional events in response to estrogens. Tamoxifen (TAM), widely used in chemotherapy of ERalpha-positive breast cancer, is considered as an ERalpha antagonist and GPER agonist. TAM was shown to possess ""off-target"" cytotoxicity, not related to ER in various tumor types. The present work was designed to study biological effects of TAM on the glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant cell line Jurkat, derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T lineage (T-ALL). We have shown that T-ALL cell lines, in contrast to healthy T cells, express only GPER, but not ERalpha or ERbeta. TAM compromised mitochondrial function and reduced the viability and proliferation of Jurkat cells. Additionally, TAM induced autophagy in a GPER-dependent manner. Gene expression profiling revealed the up-regulation of autophagy-related gene ATG5. Interestingly, TAM sensitized Jurkat cells to dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, which may be related to its capacity to cause autophagy. We suggest that TAM-based adjuvant therapy may represent a novel strategy in T-ALL patients handling.","['Torres-Lopez, Liliana', 'Maycotte, Paola', 'Linan-Rico, Andromeda', 'Linan-Rico, Liliana', 'Donis-Maturano, Luis', 'Delgado-Enciso, Ivan', 'Meza-Robles, Carmen', 'Vasquez-Jimenez, Clemente', 'Hernandez-Cruz, Arturo', 'Dobrovinskaya, Oxana']","['Torres-Lopez L', 'Maycotte P', 'Linan-Rico A', 'Linan-Rico L', 'Donis-Maturano L', 'Delgado-Enciso I', 'Meza-Robles C', 'Vasquez-Jimenez C', 'Hernandez-Cruz A', 'Dobrovinskaya O']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1526-6517'],"['University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Faculty for Chemical Sciences, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'CONACYT-Biomedical Research Center of the East, Mexican Social Security Institute, Puebla, Mexico.', 'CONACYT-University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Ensenada Biomedical Innovation Department, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.', 'Medical School, University of Colima and Cancerology Institute of Colima State, Health Services, Colima, Mexico.', 'Medical School, University of Colima and Cancerology Institute of Colima State, Health Services, Colima, Mexico.', 'University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'National Laboratory of Channelopathies (LaNCa), National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Cognitive Neuroscience-Institute of Cellular Physiology, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['2015-1/114/CONACyT/International', '279820/Laboratorio Nacional de Canalopatias/International', 'DGAPA-UNAM/Laboratorio Nacional de Canalopatias/International', 'PAPIIT-IN211616/Laboratorio Nacional de Canalopatias/International', 'IG200119/Laboratorio Nacional de Canalopatias/International', 'AH-C/Laboratorio Nacional de Canalopatias/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (ESR2 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (GPER1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/agonists/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.2VMA0818-328R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 May;105(5):983-998. doi: 10.1002/JLB.2VMA0818-328R.

In this study, we firstly aimed to investigate the role of EPHX1 in the chemoresistance of acute myeloid leukemic cells to aclarubicin (ACM) and mitoxantrone (MIT). EPHX1 mRNA expression and prognosis were measured in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and the function of EPHX1 in leukemic cell viability and apoptosis induced by ACM and MIT was also measured. Our results found that EPHX1 expression is obviously associated with recurrence rate, overall survival and time of obtaining first complete remission in AML patients. EPHX1 silencing promoted ACM and MIT induced decrease in cell viability and cell apoptosis of HL-60, K562, and THP-1 that was inhibited by EPHX1 overexpression. EPHX1 reduced the susceptibility of leukemic cells to ACM and MIT by regulating drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1) and apoptotic signaling (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and PARP1). Moreover, Nrf2 overexpression significantly increased EPHX1 expression and leukemic cell viability and decreased leukemic cell apoptosis. Taken together, we summarized the recent findings about the chemoresistance-promoting role of EPHX1, and the potential of targeting EPHX1 was proposed to counteract drug resistance in leukemia treatment.","['Cheng, Hui', 'Huang, Chongmei', 'Tang, Gusheng', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Gao, Lei', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Chen, Li']","['Cheng H', 'Huang C', 'Tang G', 'Qiu H', 'Gao L', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Yang J', 'Chen L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9154-9282'],"['Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['81400133/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81770209/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '18411968100/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai', 'Municipality/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.2.9 (EPHX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.22973 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2019 May;58(5):808-819. doi: 10.1002/mc.22973.

OxS exerts diverse effects and is associated with the pathophysiology of more than 100 diseases, as well as with the aging process. OxS also plays a role in maintaining the homeostasis of both animal and plant organisms. We analyze the role and mechanisms of the generation of RS and antioxidants both under physiological conditions and during aging and pathological processes. Likewise, the potential of antioxidant agents from the diet is considered, specifically fruits such as chayote. We focus on naringenin, a flavonoid with a high antioxidant capacity. METHOD: We conducted a literature review to present the state of the art of knowledge about the biological significance of oxidative stress and the effect of antioxidants in some edible fruits. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the existence of RS, their physiological roles as well its harmful effects when oxidative stress occurs. In this sense, given the association of oxidative stress with diseases and aging the fruits rich in antioxidants are a feasible alternative to restore de redox balance if necessary.","['Rosado-Perez, Juana', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez, Itzen', 'Arista-Ugalde, Taide L', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Mendoza-Nunez, Victor M']","['Rosado-Perez J', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez I', 'Arista-Ugalde TL', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Mendoza-Nunez VM']",,"['Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, MEX, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, MEX, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, MEX, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, MEX, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, MEX, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biological Products)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Fruit/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Plants, Edible/*chemistry']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPD-EPUB-95786 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612824666190114164758 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2018;24(40):4807-4824. doi: 10.2174/1381612824666190114164758.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Oxidative stress', '*Sechium edule', '*aging', '*chronic diseases', '*naringenin', '*natural antioxidants.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective case series of 143 patients.,65-70,,"Cryotherapy, also called Cryoablation (CA), is a technique that provides a local treatment to various pathological conditions. In Musculoskeletal tumours management, Cryoablation is well accepted and validated as a treatment in palliative cures for metastatic patients. Recently, CA has been proposed also as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation in osteoid osteoma and other benign tumour treatment with promising results. Cryotherapy with argon ice-balls as local adjuvant in open surgery is a tool that can provide enlargement of surgical margins if used properly. There is still not enough evidence supporting use of cryotherapy as local adjuvant in Musculoskeletal open surgery as the series cited above are very small and there is no comparative RCT between local adjuvant therapies including CA. One-hundred-and-eighty-three patients were treated with Cryoablation from 2000 and 2018 in the Musculoskeletal Tumours Surgery Unit of Careggi (Florence) and the University 2nd Clinic of Pisa. In our study group, 38 patients (26.6%) were affected by bone metastasis, 16 patients (11.1%) by aneurismal bone cysts or angiomas, 22 patients (15.4%) by low-grade malignant musculoskeletal tumours, 2 patients (1,4%) by fibromatosis, 63 patients (44.1%) by benign musculoskeletal tumours (principally Giant Cell Tumours-GCT) and 2 patients (1.4%) by Osteosarcomas. In 125 cases (87.4%), CA has been used as an adjuvant therapy, in 12 cases (8.4%) as a percutaneous ablation therapy and in 6 cases (4.2%) as adjuvant to remove tumoral lesions 'en bloc' or as a 'poor technique' for its sterilizing effect on previously resected bones. Mean follow-up was 10 years. Twenty-three patients (16%) were classified as Alive with Disease (AWD) due to local recurrence or tumour progression (14 metastases, 5 low-grade malignant bone tumours, 4 Giant Cell Tumours). Eight patients died due to the disease (6 metastases, 2 osteosarcomas), while 1 died from leukaemia. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (78%) were classified as Continues Disease Free (CDF). All patients reported decrease in pain-related symptoms after surgery and all surgeons reported better control of blood loss. Three cases (2%) of local skin necrosis or wound dehiscence were reported. No local recurrences were reported after fibromatosis ablation. Our results confirm that CA could be considered as a safe and effective technique to treat various conditions as adjuvant and palliative therapy. In particular, in open surgery, cryotherapy as an adjuvant treatment could lead to very low rates of recurrence in locally aggressive tumours like Giant Cell Tumours. These results could be generalized but a better understanding about indications and outcomes can be reached studying CA in specific populations with comparation to other adjuvant techniques.","['Colangeli, S', 'Parchi, P', 'Andreani, L', 'Beltrami, G', 'Scoccianti, G', 'Sacchetti, F', 'Ceccoli, M', 'Totti, F', 'Campanacci, D A', 'Capanna, R']","['Colangeli S', 'Parchi P', 'Andreani L', 'Beltrami G', 'Scoccianti G', 'Sacchetti F', 'Ceccoli M', 'Totti F', 'Campanacci DA', 'Capanna R']",,"['Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.', 'Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.', 'Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Firenze, Italy.', 'Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.', 'Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Firenze, Italy.', 'Second Orthopedic Division, Department of Translational Research and New Technology in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/*surgery/*therapy', '*Cryotherapy', 'Giant Cell Tumors/surgery/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Osteosarcoma/surgery/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/06/15 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['11 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2018 Nov-Dec;32(6 Suppl. 1):65-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saffron retards the growth of cancer cells via inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis and enhancing antioxidative system. It can induce apoptosis and chemosensitivity via inhibiting multidrug resistance proteins. Saffron also induces differentiation pathways via inhibiting promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha, histone deacetylase1, and tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-1 as well. The present review highlights the most recent findings on the antileukemic effects of saffron and its underlying molecular targets. The emerging evidence suggests that saffron has a selective toxicity effect against leukemic cells while is safe for the normal cells.","['Moradzadeh, Maliheh', 'Kalani, Mohamad Reza', 'Avan, Amir']","['Moradzadeh M', 'Kalani MR', 'Avan A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6094-8712', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8756-1200', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4968-0962']","['Department of Rheumatology, Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of New Sciences and Technology, Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of New Sciences and Technology, Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '877GWI46C2 (crocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carotenoids/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crocus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27525 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Apr;120(4):4732-4738. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27525.

The aim of this study was to determine whether periodontal ligament-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDLSCs) have the ability to modulate neutrophil responses via paracrine mechanisms. METHODS: CD105-enriched PDLSCs were seeded for 24 h and challenged with Porphyromonas gingivalis total protein extract (PgPE) (0 or 2 ug/mL) for 3 h. Cells were then washed and further cultured for 18 h and the supernatants were collected and stored. Next, neutrophil-differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (HL60D) were treated with PDLSCs supernatants and HL-60D activation and functional responses were determined. RESULTS: PgPE treatment induced higher secretion of inflammatory markers and chemokines by PDLSCs, including RANTES, eotaxin, interferon (IFN)-gamma- inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1ra (P < 0.05). HL-60D recruitment rate was increased by 4.7 +/- 1.09-fold when exposed to PgPE-treated PDLSCs supernatants. PgPE-treated PDLSCs supernatants promoted a 1.78 +/- 1.04-fold increase in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMA-stimulated HL-60D, whereas PgPE-untreated PDLSCs supernatants led to a 16% reduction in intracellular ROS. In sharp contrast, neither PgPE-untreated nor PgPE-treated PDLSCs supernatants altered tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1beta secretion by HL-60D cells. CONCLUSION: Together, these findings suggest an important role of PDLSCs in the recognition of P. gingivalis, paracrine recruitment and activation of antimicrobial mechanisms in innate immune cells, without interfering in cytokine responses.","['Misawa, Monica Yuri Orita', 'Silverio Ruiz, Karina Gonzales', 'Nociti, Francisco Humberto Jr', 'Albiero, Mayra Laino', 'Saito, Miki Taketomi', 'Nobrega Stipp, Rafael', 'Condino-Neto, Antonio', 'Holzhausen, Marinella', 'Palombo, Henrique', 'Villar, Cristina Cunha']","['Misawa MYO', 'Silverio Ruiz KG', 'Nociti FH Jr', 'Albiero ML', 'Saito MT', 'Nobrega Stipp R', 'Condino-Neto A', 'Holzhausen M', 'Palombo H', 'Villar CC']",,"['Division of Periodontics, Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Prosthodontics and Periodontics, Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Prosthodontics and Periodontics, Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Prosthodontics and Periodontics, Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Prosthodontics and Periodontics, Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Diagnosis, Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Periodontics, Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Periodontics, UTHSC, San Antonio Dental School, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Neutrophils', 'Osteogenesis', '*Periodontal Ligament']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JPER.18-0220 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2019 Jul;90(7):747-755. doi: 10.1002/JPER.18-0220.

Methods: We conducted a clinical pathological retrospective chart review. Results: Eleven months after documented remission of T-cell ALL while on maintenance therapy, this 17-year-old patient presented with acute open angle glaucoma in the right eye. B-scan ultrasonography suggested total retinal detachment. Eight weeks later, based on routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the patient was diagnosed with central nervous system relapse of T-cell ALL. Repeat B-scan 1 week later showed a new hyperechoic subretinal mass. FNA of the mass confirmed leukemic infiltrate. The involved eye was enucleated, demonstrating leukemic cells throughout the subretinal space, choroid, and the optic nerve. Following hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the patient continues to maintain bone marrow remission 5 months after enucleation without involvement in the opposite eye. Conclusion: Retinal detachment in any patient with a history of leukemia should raise the possibility of relapse and may warrant aspiration/biopsy if other means of diagnosing relapse are inconclusive. Subretinal infiltrate may progress rapidly and prompt diagnosis is paramount to tailoring therapy and preserving vision.","['Gillette, Thomas B', 'Cabrera, Michelle T', 'Tarlock, Katherine', 'Murphy, Claire E', 'Chisholm, Karen M', 'Stacey, Andrew W']","['Gillette TB', 'Cabrera MT', 'Tarlock K', 'Murphy CE', 'Chisholm KM', 'Stacey AW']",,"[""Clinical and Translational Research, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington, WA, USA.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, WA, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, WA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, WA, USA.', ""Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Ocul Oncol Pathol,Ocular oncology and pathology,101656139,,,,PMC6322080,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/01/16 06:01,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000484054 [doi]', 'oop-0004-0220 [pii]']",ppublish,Ocul Oncol Pathol. 2018 Jun;4(4):220-224. doi: 10.1159/000484054.

Neomorphic mutations in isoform 1 of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) result in the formation of the onco-metabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate, which drives leukemic transformation by affecting processes such as chromatin remodeling, the cellular defense against oxidative stress and cell survival. Preclinical studies with small molecule inhibitors have validated mutant IDH1 as a molecular target, and a recent Phase 1 clinical trial with the first mutant IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib has prompted approval by the US Food and Drug Association for the treatment of patients with IDH1-mutated AML in the relapsed and refractory setting due to impressive results. This approval has given a group of patients, that otherwise has a very poor prognosis and limited options, new hope, and it is to be expected that more indications for ivosidenib will follow soon. These developments highlight the potential of precision medicine in AML, with more agents currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Although the first reports have also already emerged describing acquired resistance for these mutant IDH inhibitors, combination treatment might overcome this problem, which could drastically change the treatment landscape of AML over the next few years.","['Nassereddine, Samah', 'Lap, Coen J', 'Tabbara, Imad A']","['Nassereddine S', 'Lap CJ', 'Tabbara IA']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA, itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA, itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA, itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA, itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA, itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6314316,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/01/16 06:01,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S182443 [doi]', 'ott-12-303 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Dec 28;12:303-308. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S182443. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'IDH1', 'ivosidenib', 'refractory', 'relapsed']",,,20181228,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, before clinical trials, their binding to plasma proteins like human serum albumin (HSA) and their cytotoxic effects against normal and cancer cell lines should be addressed. Methods: Herein, the interaction of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs) with HSA was studied by means of fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and docking studies. Afterwards, the cytotoxic impacts of MgO NPs on human leukemia cell line (K562) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry assays to quantify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis. Results: It was demonstrated that MgO NPs spontaneously form a static complex with HSA molecules through hydrophobic interactions. Docking study based on the size of NPs demonstrated that different linkages can be established between MgO NPs and HSA. The CD investigation explored that MgO NPs did not alter the secondary structure of HSA. Cellular studies revealed that MgO NPs induced cytotoxicity against K562 cell lines, whereas no adverse effects were detected on PBMCs up to optimum applied concentration of MgO NPs. It was exhibited that ROS production mediated by IC50 concentrations of MgO NPs caused apoptosis-associated cell death. The pre-incubation of K562 with ROS scavenger (curcumin) inhibited the impact of MgO NPs -based apoptosis on cell fate, revealing the upstream effect of ROS in our system. Conclusion: In summary, MgO NPs may exhibit strong plasma distribution and mediate apoptosis by ROS induction in the cancer cell lines. These data demonstrate a safe aspect of MgO NPs on the proteins and normal cells and their application as a distinctive therapeutic approach in the cancer treatment.","['Behzadi, Elham', 'Sarsharzadeh, Rozhin', 'Nouri, Mina', 'Attar, Farnoosh', 'Akhtari, Keivan', 'Shahpasand, Koorosh', 'Falahati, Mojtaba']","['Behzadi E', 'Sarsharzadeh R', 'Nouri M', 'Attar F', 'Akhtari K', 'Shahpasand K', 'Falahati M']",,"['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Food Industry and Agriculture, Standard Research Institute (SRI), Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Physics, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nanotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, falahati@ibb.ut.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['3A3U0GI71G (Magnesium Oxide)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Magnesium Oxide/*chemistry', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Serum Albumin, Human/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6312066,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/02/13 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S186428 [doi]', 'ijn-14-257 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2018 Dec 27;14:257-270. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S186428. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'albumin', 'anticancer', 'magnesium oxide', 'nanoparticles', 'spectroscopy']",,,20181227,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Target identification approaches revealed a role for SLC39A7 (ZIP7), a zinc transport family member, in governing Notch trafficking and signaling. Generation and sequencing of a compound-resistant cell line identified a V430E mutation in ZIP7 that confers transferable resistance to the compound NVS-ZP7-4. NVS-ZP7-4 altered zinc in the ER, and an analog of the compound photoaffinity labeled ZIP7 in cells, suggesting a direct interaction between the compound and ZIP7.

Using integrated genomic analysis of 1,988 childhood and adult cases, we describe a revised taxonomy of B-ALL incorporating 23 subtypes defined by chromosomal rearrangements, sequence mutations or heterogeneous genomic alterations, many of which show marked variation in prevalence according to age. Two subtypes have frequent alterations of the B lymphoid transcription-factor gene PAX5. One, PAX5alt (7.4%), has diverse PAX5 alterations (rearrangements, intragenic amplifications or mutations); a second subtype is defined by PAX5 p.Pro80Arg and biallelic PAX5 alterations. We show that p.Pro80Arg impairs B lymphoid development and promotes the development of B-ALL with biallelic Pax5 alteration in vivo. These results demonstrate the utility of transcriptome sequencing to classify B-ALL and reinforce the central role of PAX5 as a checkpoint in B lymphoid maturation and leukemogenesis.","['Gu,

Ibrutinib was the first approved for use in 2014 and now is used for initial and salvage therapy of CLL patients. With its widespread use in clinical practice, ibrutinib's common and uncommon adverse events reported less frequently in earlier clinical trials have been experienced more frequently in real-world practice. In particular, atrial fibrillation, bleeding, infections, and arthralgias have been reported. The management of ibrutinib's adverse events often cannot be generalized but must be individualized to the patient and their long-term risk of additional complications. When ibrutinib was initially developed, there were limited therapeutic alternatives for CLL, which often resulted in treating through the adverse events. At the present time, there are several effective alternative agents available, so transition to an alternative CLL directed therapy may be considered. Given the continued expansion of ibrutinib across many therapeutic areas, investigation of the pathogenesis of adverse events with this agent and also clinical trials examining therapeutic approaches for complications arising during therapy are needed. Herein, we provide strategies we use in real-world CLL clinical practice to address common adverse events associated with ibrutinib.","['Stephens, Deborah M', 'Byrd, John C']","['Stephens DM', 'Byrd JC']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9188-5008'],"['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, and.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['K23 CA212271/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Arthralgia/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Atrial Fibrillation/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",PMC6428663,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42685-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-11-846808 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 21;133(12):1298-1307. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-11-846808.

She initially underwent a platelet transfusion without improvement. This was followed by 4 days of high-dose dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin, which again yielded no meaningful effect. Even a single-dose rituximab failed to achieve a platelet increase after 5 days of monitoring. The patient was then given 2 mg of intravenous vincristine along with a high-dose of dexamethasone and IVIG and demonstrated substantial recovery in platelets to >50x10(3)/microL within 48 hours.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignant diseases. METHODS: We did a two-part, open-label, phase 1/2a study at 21 hospitals in Australia, Israel, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and the USA. The primary objective of part A (dose escalation) was to assess the safety of daily oral ibrutinib (420 mg or 560 mg) in combination with intravenous nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) to ascertain a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (del17p or del11q), follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Dose optimisation was investigated using a modified toxicity probability interval design. The primary objective of the part B expansion phase was to establish the preliminary activity (the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response) of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in four cohorts: relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (del17p or del11q), follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Richter's transformation. All participants who received at least one dose of treatment were included in the primary analysis and analyses were done by disease cohort. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02329847. The trial is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 12, 2015, and April 11, 2017, 144 patients were enrolled in the study. Three patients died before receiving study treatment; thus, 141 patients were included in the analysis, 14 in part A and 127 in part B. One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia) was reported at the 420 mg dose in the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, which resolved after 5 days. The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab led to overall responses in 22 (61%) of 36 patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, 13 (33%) of 40 patients with follicular lymphoma, 16 (36%) of 45 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 13 (65%) of 20 patients with Richter's transformation. The most common all-grade adverse events were diarrhoea (47 [33%] of 141 patients), neutropenia (44 [31%]), and fatigue (37 [26%]). 11 (8%) of 141 patients had adverse events leading to death; none were reported as drug-related. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (40 [28%] of 141 patients) and anaemia (32 [23%]). The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from eight (18%) of 45 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to 19 (53%) of 36 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; incidence of grade 3-4 anaemia ranged from five (13%) of 40 patients with follicular lymphoma to seven (35%) of 20 patients with Richter's transformation. The most common serious adverse events included anaemia (six [4%] of 141 patients) and pneumonia (five [4%]). The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events were rash (11 [8%] of 141 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (three [2%]). INTERPRETATION: The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab had an acceptable safety profile and preliminary activity was similar to that reported with single-agent ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The clinical response in patients with Richter's transformation was promising and supports further clinical assessment.

Expression of FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 was investigated in 19 bovine papillomavirus-associated urinary bladder cancers and in 15 non-neoplastic samples of bladder from cattle. E5 oncoprotein of bovine Deltapapillomaviruses (deltaPVs) was detected in 17 of the 19 bladder cancers. Flvcr1 and Flvcr2 were amplified and sequenced both in neoplastic and non-neoplastic samples showing a 100% identity with bovine Flvcr1 and Flvcr2 mRNA sequences present in GenBank database (accession numbers: NM_001206019.1 and NM_001192143.1, respectively). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that Flvcr1 and Flvcr2 were overexpressed in 4 and 5 out of 19 urothelial cancers, respectively, but in none of the non-neoplastic samples. In addition, western blot analysis detected higher levels of FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 in samples in which transcripts were not increased, suggesting post-translational changes to these proteins. Increased FLCVR1 and FLVCR2 was also observed immunohistochemically in the neoplastic cells. Immunolabeling for FLVCR1 was seen in the cytoplasm and plasm membrane of urothelial cancer cells, wheras immunolabeling for FLVCR2 was present within the nucleus. This is the first time that FLVCR expression has been investigated in bovine tissues and the first to suggest that expression could be increased in cancers. Additional studies are required to define the role, if any, of FLVCR in papillomavirus-associated cancer cells.","['Russo, Valeria', 'Roperto, Franco', 'Taulescu, Marian', 'De Falco, Francesca', 'Urraro, Chiara', 'Corrado, Federica', 'Munday, John S', 'Catoi, Cornel', 'Roperto, Sante']","['Russo V', 'Roperto F', 'Taulescu M', 'De Falco F', 'Urraro C', 'Corrado F', 'Munday JS', 'Catoi C', 'Roperto S']",,"['Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.', 'University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Pathology Department, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Portici, Napoli, Italy.', 'Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.', 'University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Pathology Department, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.

The ability to predict treatment response based on individual cancer genomics using computational modeling will aid in the development of novel therapeutics and personalize care. Here, we used a combination of genomics, computational biology modeling (CBM), ex vivo chemosensitivity assay, and clinical data from 100 randomly selected patients in the Beat AML project to characterize AML sensitivity to a bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor. Computational biology modeling was used to generate patient-specific protein network maps of activated and inactivated protein pathways translated from each genomic profile. Digital drug simulations of a BET inhibitor (JQ1) were conducted by quantitatively measuring drug effect using a composite AML disease inhibition score. 93% of predicted disease inhibition scores matched the associated ex vivo IC50 value. Sensitivity and specificity of CBM predictions were 97.67%, and 64.29%, respectively. Genomic predictors of response were identified. Patient samples harbouring chromosomal aberrations del(7q) or -7, +8, or del(5q) and somatic mutations causing ERK pathway dysregulation, responded to JQ1 in both in silico and ex vivo assays. This study shows how a combination of genomics, computational modeling and chemosensitivity testing can identify network signatures associating with treatment response and can inform priority populations for future clinical trials of BET inhibitors.","['Drusbosky, Leylah M', 'Vidva, Robinson', 'Gera, Saji', 'Lakshminarayana, Anjanasree V', 'Shyamasundar, Vijayashree P', 'Agrawal, Ashish Kumar', 'Talawdekar, Anay', 'Abbasi, Taher', 'Vali, Shireen', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Drusbosky LM', 'Vidva R', 'Gera S', 'Lakshminarayana AV', 'Shyamasundar VP', 'Agrawal AK', 'Talawdekar A', 'Abbasi T', 'Vali S', 'Tognon CE', 'Kurtz SE', 'Tyner JW', 'McWeeney SK', 'Druker BJ', 'Cogle CR']",,"['Department of Medicine/Division of Hematology Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.', 'Cellworks Research India Pvt.

However, the role and expression pattern of lncRNAs in molecular subtypes of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) have not yet been investigated. Here, we assess to what extent lncRNA expression and DNA methylation is driving the progression of relapsed BCP-ALL subtypes and we determine if the expression and DNA methylation profile of lncRNAs correlates with established BCP-ALL subtypes. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and DNA methylation (Illumina Infinium microarray) of 40 diagnosis and 42 relapse samples from 45 BCP-ALL patients in a German cohort and quantified lncRNA expression. Unsupervised clustering was applied to ascertain and confirm that the lncRNA-based classification of the BCP-ALL molecular subtypes is present in both our cohort and an independent validation cohort of 47 patients. A differential expression and differential methylation analysis was applied to determine the subtype-specific, relapse-specific, and differentially methylated lncRNAs. Potential functions of subtype-specific lncRNAs were determined by using co-expression-based analysis on nearby (cis) and distally (trans) located protein-coding genes. RESULTS: Using an integrative Bioinformatics analysis, we developed a comprehensive catalog of 1235 aberrantly dysregulated BCP-ALL subtype-specific and 942 relapse-specific lncRNAs and the methylation profile of three subtypes of BCP-ALL. The 1235 subtype-specific lncRNA signature represented a similar classification of the molecular subtypes of BCP-ALL in the independent validation cohort. We identified a strong correlation between the DUX4-specific lncRNAs and genes involved in the activation of TGF-beta and Hippo signaling pathways. Similarly, Ph-like-specific lncRNAs were correlated with genes involved in the activation of PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Interestingly, the relapse-specific lncRNAs correlated with the activation of metabolic and signaling pathways. Finally, we found 23 promoter methylated lncRNAs epigenetically facilitating their expression levels. CONCLUSION: Here, we describe a set of subtype-specific and relapse-specific lncRNAs from three major BCP-ALL subtypes and define their potential functions and epigenetic regulation. The subtype-specific lncRNAs are reproducible and can effectively stratify BCP-ALL subtypes. Our data uncover the diverse mechanism of action of lncRNAs in BCP-ALL subtypes defining which lncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of disease and are relevant for the stratification of BCP-ALL subtypes.","['James, Alva Rani', 'Schroeder, Michael P', 'Neumann, Martin', 'Bastian, Lorenz', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Tanchez, Jutta Ortiz', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Isaakidis,

The treatment of 6-methoxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one 3 with LiHMDS in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) followed by reaction with 3-substitued phenyl isothiocyanate gave the thioamide intermediates, which underwent condensation with hydrazine monohydrate in dioxane/EtOH (1:1) to provide the benzofuropyrazole derivatives 4a(-)e as well as the unexpected pyrazole derivatives 5a(-)e. In tumor cell growth inhibitory assay, all the benzofuropyrazole derivatives were not active against the breast tumor MCF-7 cell, only 4a was highly active and more potent than ABT-751 against the leukemia K562 (GI50 = 0.26 muM) and lung tumor A549 cells (GI50 = 0.19 muM), while other benzofuropyrazoles showed very weak inhibitory activity. In contrast, the pyrazoles 5a-e were in general more potent than the benzofuropyrazoles 4a(-)e. Compound 5a exhibited a similar tendency to that of 4a with high potency against K562 and A549 cells but weak effects on MCF-7 cell. Both pyrazoles 5b and 5e exhibited high inhibitory activities against K562, MCF-7 and A549 cells. The most active compound 5b was much more potent than ABT-751 against K562 and A549 cells with GI50 values of 0.021 and 0.69 M, respectively. Moreover, 5b was identified as a novel tubulin polymerization inhibitor with an IC50 of 7.30 M.","['Cui, Ying-Jie', 'Tang, Long-Qian', 'Zhang, Cheng-Mei', 'Liu, Zhao-Peng']","['Cui YJ', 'Tang LQ', 'Zhang CM', 'Liu ZP']",,"['Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. yingjiecui@sina.cn.', 'Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. lqtang.student@sina.com.', 'Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. zhangcm@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. liuzhaop@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['81573275/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017CXGC1401/the key research and development program of Shandong province']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Pyrazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/chemistry/pharmacology']",PMC6359563,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2019/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24020279 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24020279 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Jan 13;24(2). pii: molecules24020279. doi: 10.3390/molecules24020279.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antitumor', 'antitumor agents', 'privileged structure', 'pyrazoles', 'tubulin inhibitors']",,,20190113,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pivotal role played by the microenvironment in disease pathogenesis has become increasingly clear. We demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cells and trabecular bone cells sustain survival of leukemic B cells through the production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Indeed the trans-membrane kinase receptor for HGF, c-MET, is expressed on CLL cells and STAT3 TYR(705) or AKT phosphorylation is induced after HGF/c-MET interaction. We have further observed that c-MET is also highly expressed in a peculiar type of cells of the CLL-microenvironment showing nurturing features for the leukemic clone (nurse-like cells: NLCs). Since HGF treatment drives monocytes toward the M2 phenotype and NLCs exhibit features of tumor associated macrophages of type 2 we suggested that HGF, released either by cells of the microenvironment or leukemic cells, exerts a double effect: i) enhances CLL cells survival and ii) drives differentiation of monocytes-macrophages to an oriented immune suppressive phenotype. We here discuss how paracrine, but also autocrine production of HGF by malignant cells, may favor leukemic clone expansion and resistance to conventional drug treatments in CLL, as well as in other hematological malignancies. Novel therapeutic approaches aimed to block HGF/c-MET interactions are further proposed.","['Giannoni, Paolo', 'Fais, Franco', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Totero, Daniela de']","['Giannoni P', 'Fais F', 'Cutrona G', 'Totero D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7206-376X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3335-1101', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8481-7848']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, V.

Methods: Four cases of ATLL from Fujian Cancer Hospital between October 2017 and May 2018 were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HTLV-1 provirus genes. The relevant literature was reviewed. Results: There were two males and two females, age range 38-80 years. All patients were from coastal cities of Fujian province. Clinical presentations including lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were detected in most patients; skin lesion, hypercalcemia and lymphocytosis were also commonly detected.Histologically, there was diffuse effacement of the normal architecture by tumor cells infiltration. The inflammatory background is usually sparse, with scanty eosinophils. The atypical lymphoid cells were typically medium to large sized with pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, irregular nuclei, chromatin clumping and prominent nucleoli. Blast-like cells with transformed nuclei were present in variable proportions. Giant cells with convoluted or cerebriform nuclear contours may be present. Rare cases may be composed predominantly of anaplastic tumor cells. Characteristic ""flower cells"" with large multi-lobated nuclei can be seen. The tumor cells were strongly positive for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD25, but negative for CD7, CD8 and cytotoxic molecules (including TIA-1, Granzyme B and perforin). In three cases, the large transformed cells were positive for CD30. In one case, the anaplastic large cells were diffusely and strongly positive for CD30. All cases were negative for EBER, but positive for HTLV-1 provirus. Conclusions: ATLL is a rare type of T cell lymphoma with unique clinical and pathological features, and should be distinguished from peripheral T cell lymphoma, NOS, ALK negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides. Hypercalcemia, systemic disease, characteristic ""flower cells"" and specific immunophenotypic profile of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD25(+), and CD7(-) are highly suggestive. However, ATLL can only be confirmed if the presence of HTLV-1 provirus.","['Chen, Y P', 'Wu, Z J', 'Liu, W', 'Lu, J P', 'Wang, J C', 'Zhu, W F', 'Chen, F F', 'Zhong, L H', 'Chen, G']","['Chen YP', 'Wu ZJ', 'Liu W', 'Lu JP', 'Wang JC', 'Zhu WF', 'Chen FF', 'Zhong LH', 'Chen G']",,"['Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Biotherapy, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou 350014, China.']",['chi'],"['General Program; 2016J01512, 2018J01277/Natural Science Foundation of Fujian', 'Province', '2017Y9081/Joint Funds for the Innovation of Science and Technology, Fujian', 'Province', '2016-ZQN-16, 2018-CX-10/Fujian Provincial Health and Family Planning Research', 'Talent Training Program', '2018Y2003/Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Department Planning Project']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphadenopathy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,,2019/01/16 06:00,2019/02/28 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2019.01.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jan 8;48(1):11-16. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2019.01.003.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diagnosis, differential', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Hypercalcemia', 'Leukemia-lymphoma, adult T-cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these conditions are treated with immunobiologic agents that affect immune function and may increase risk of opportunistic infections (OIs) and other immune disorders in individuals with HIV infection. For example, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, used to treat such disorders as Crohn's disease, are associated with risk of tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. Rituximab, used to treat lymphoma, has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to JC virus and reactivation of other viral infections. Idealisib, used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, has been associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia, and immune checkpoint inhibitors used to treat a variety of cancers have been associated with a wide range of immune-related adverse effects. Practitioners must maintain high vigilance for OIs and other immune-related disorders in patients with HIV infection who are receiving biologic therapies.

In this study, we present evidence that green tea extract and its chemical component, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), inhibit growth of human myeloid leukemia cells through the regulation of pRb synthesis and formation of pRb-E2F complexes. Addition of green tea extract to the culture of TF-1a and MV4-11 myeloid leukemia cells significantly inhibited their proliferation with a substantial portion of cell death being observed. The green tea extract and EGCG had no significant effect on the expression of G1 CDKs and the CDK inhibitors but downregulated the formation of pRb-CDKs. Surprisingly, the expression of pRb was markedly upregulated while the phosphorylation of pRb downregulated. The upregulation of pRb was blocked by pre-treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting a requirement of protein synthesis. In agreement with these results, pRb-E2F complexes were upregulated and E2F DNA binding activity decreased. Since both TF-1a and MV4-11 are factor-independent cell lines, the upregulation of pRb-E2F complexes and inhibition of DNA binding activity by green tea extract is most likely through a receptor tyrosine kinase-independent pathway. We also found that the stem/progenitor cells derived from these two leukemia cell lines are more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of green tea extract. Our result suggests that concentrated green tea extract and EGCG may have potential for clinical investigation as an inducer of cancer cell death.","['Henry, Darrell', 'Brumaire, Sebastien', 'Hu, Xiaotang']","['Henry D', 'Brumaire S', 'Hu X']",,"['Department of Biology, College of Arts & Sciences, Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida 33161, USA.', 'Department of Biology, College of Arts & Sciences, Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida 33161, USA.', 'Department of Biology, College of Arts & Sciences, Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida 33161, USA.

Using computational biology modeling (CBM) in conjunction with genomic data from cell lines and individual patients, we generated disease-specific protein network maps that were used to identify unique characteristics associated with the mutational profiles of ETP-ALL compared to non-ETP-ALL (T-ALL) cases and simulated cellular responses to a digital library of FDA-approved and investigational agents. Genomics-based classification of ETP-ALL patients using CBM had a prediction sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 87%, respectively. This analysis identified key genomic and pathway characteristics that are distinct in ETP-ALL including deletion of nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1), mutations of which are used to direct therapeutic decisions in acute myeloid leukemia. Computational simulations based on mutational profiles of 62 ETP-ALL patient models identified 87 unique targeted combination therapies in 56 of the 62 patients despite actionable mutations being present in only 37% of ETP-ALL patients. Shortlisted two-drug combinations were predicted to be synergistic in 11 profiles and were validated by in vitro chemosensitivity assays. In conclusion, computational modeling was able to identify unique biomarkers and pathways for ETP-ALL, and identify new drug combinations for potential clinical testing.","['Kumar, Ansu', 'Drusbosky, Leylah M', 'Meacham, Amy', 'Turcotte, Madeleine', 'Bhargav, Priyanka', 'Vasista, Sumanth', 'Usmani, Shahabuddin', 'Pampana, Anusha', 'Basu, Kabya', 'Tyagi, Anuj', 'Lala, Deepak', 'Rajagopalan, Swaminathan', 'Birajdar, Shivgonda C', 'Alam, Aftab', 'Ghosh Roy, Kunal', 'Abbasi, Taher', 'Vali, Shireen', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Chinnaswamy, Girish', 'Shah, Bijal D', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Kumar A', 'Drusbosky LM', 'Meacham A', 'Turcotte M', 'Bhargav P', 'Vasista S', 'Usmani S', 'Pampana A', 'Basu K', 'Tyagi A', 'Lala D', 'Rajagopalan S', 'Birajdar SC', 'Alam A', 'Ghosh Roy K', 'Abbasi T', 'Vali S', 'Sengar M', 'Chinnaswamy G', 'Shah BD', 'Cogle CR']",,"['Cellworks Research India Pvt.

METHODS: We conducted a survey among AIEOP centers; thereafter, we collected and analyzed data with regard to the treatment of episodes of severe acquired hypofibrinogenemia occurring during the induction and reinduction phases of the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 protocol. RESULTS: In total, 15 of the 37 AIEOP centers invited to join the survey agreed to collect the data, with 10 and 5 centers declaring to react to severe acquired hypofibrinogenemia (<70 mg/dL) by administering HFC or FFP, respectively. Of the 150 episodes of severe hypofibrinogenemia occurring in 101 patients, 47.3% were treated with HFC and 52.7% with FFP, with a normalization of fibrinogen levels achieved in greater proportion and in a shorter amount of time in the HFC group as compared with the FFP group. None of the patients presented with bleeding or thrombosis during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the limitations of the retrospective nature of this study, HFC seems to be a safe and effective alternative to FFP for replacement therapy in case of severe hypofibrinogenemia in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Giordano, Paola', 'Grassi, Massimo', 'Saracco, Paola', 'Luciani, Matteo', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Testi, Anna M', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Petruzziello, Fara', 'Putti, Maria C', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Consarino, Caterina', 'Mura, Rosa M', 'Mastrodicasa, Elena', 'Notarangelo, Lucia D', 'Onofrillo, Daniela', 'Pollio, Berardino', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Tafuri, Silvio', 'De Leonardis, Francesco', 'Corallo, Paola C', 'Santoro, Nicola']","['Giordano P', 'Grassi M', 'Saracco P', 'Luciani M', 'Colombini A', 'Testi AM', 'Micalizzi C', 'Petruzziello F', 'Putti MC', 'Casale F', 'Consarino C', 'Mura RM', 'Mastrodicasa E', 'Notarangelo LD', 'Onofrillo D', 'Pollio B', 'Rizzari C', 'Tafuri S', 'De Leonardis F', 'Corallo PC', 'Santoro N']",,"['Department of Biomedical Science and Human Oncology-Paediatric Unit, Policlinico Hospital.', 'Division of Paediatric Haematology Oncology-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico Consorziale di Bari, Bari.', 'Paediatric Haematology, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino.', ""Department of Haematology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Ospedale S.

Recently, we discovered a novel synergistic induction of cell death by combining sorafenib, the only routinely used palliative chemotherapeutic agent, and the triterpenoid oleanolic acid (OA). However, the underlying mechanisms of action have remained obscure. Here, we report that sorafenib and OA acted in concert to trigger mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death, which is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sorafenib/OA cotreatment significantly increased ROS production, which was prevented by the ROS scavengers alpha-tocopherol and MnTBAP. Importantly, rescue experiments showed that ROS were required for sorafenib/OA-induced apoptosis as ROS scavengers protected HCC cells against cell death. In addition, sorafenib and OA cotreatment cooperated to decrease myeloid cell leukaemia-1 expression and to activate Bak, two events that were prevented by ROS scavengers.

However, new insights into the molecular characterization and biology of relapsed and refractory AML have led to novel therapeutics and improvement in outcomes in these settings. The current understanding of mechanisms of disease resistance and status of treatment options both currently available and under exploration in relapsed and refractory AML are summarized in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: The rapid approval of multiple therapeutic agents since 2017 has led to improvement in selected populations such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-mutated relapsed and refractory AML with agents such as enasidenib, ivosidenib, and gilteritinib. Despite these advancements, the only current curative approach remains allogeneic transplantation and only for those minority of patients that are candidates. However, encouraging results are being seen with a multitude of novel small molecular inhibitors and immunotherapeutic approaches currently in clinical trials both as single agents and combination strategies in both upfront and relapsed/refractory AML. SUMMARY: Continued advancements in the knowledge of various mechanisms of relapse and resistance in AML are ongoing, leading to the realization that diverse treatment strategies are needed to both prevent and manage relapsed and refractory disease.","['Mims, Alice S', 'Blum, William']","['Mims AS', 'Blum W']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology']",,,2019/01/15 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000490 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):88-95. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000490.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CB-6644, an allosteric small-molecule inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the RUVBL1/2 complex, interacts specifically with RUVBL1/2 in cancer cells, leading to cell death. Importantly, drug-acquired-resistant cell clones have amino acid mutations in either RUVBL1 or RUVBL2, suggesting that cell killing is an on-target consequence of RUVBL1/2 engagement. In xenograft models of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma, CB-6644 significantly reduced tumor growth without obvious toxicity.

Radiation induces persistent alterations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and the bone marrow environment; however, how relevant host factors such as obesity and exercise differentially regulate HSPC content and the bone marrow environment after radiation exposure remains unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate how the combination of obesity and exercise training modulates HSPC and their niche after sublethal radiation exposure in mice. METHODS: Mice fed either a control or a high-fat diet to induce obesity remained sedentary or underwent a progressive treadmill exercise program. At 13 wk of age, mice were irradiated (3 Gy) and continued their specific diets and exercise program for four more weeks. RESULTS: Exercise-trained mice had significantly higher quantities of several HSPC subpopulations and bone marrow stromal cell populations, whereas HSPC subpopulations were significantly lower in obese mice after radiation. Reactive oxygen species content was significantly decreased in HSPC with exercise training. Proteomics analysis of bone marrow supernatant revealed clustering of biologically relevant changes in exercise-trained mice. Functional evaluation of bone marrow supernatant revealed a significant increase in leukemia blast viability in obese mice but not in the exercise-trained mice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Together, these data suggest that exercise training partially restores the negative effects of obesity on HSPC and their niche after radiation exposure. As such, exercise training should be considered to mitigate the late effects of radiation therapy on the hematopoietic system for cancer survivors with or without obesity who have undergone radiation therapy.","['Emmons, Russell', 'Ngu, Matthew', 'Xu, Guanying', 'Hernandez-Saavedra, Diego', 'Chen, Hong', 'DE Lisio, Michael']","['Emmons R', 'Ngu M', 'Xu G', 'Hernandez-Saavedra D', 'Chen H', 'DE Lisio M']",,"['Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, CANADA.', 'Department of Food Sciences and Human Nutrition, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'Department of Food Sciences and Human Nutrition, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL.', 'School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, CANADA.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Centre on Neuromuscular Disease, and Brain and Mind Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, CANADA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,8005433,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Obesity/*physiopathology', 'Oxidative Stress/radiation effects', '*Physical Conditioning, Animal', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1249/MSS.0000000000001894 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2019 Jun;51(6):1126-1136. doi: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001894.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutated NPM1 (DeltaNPM1) is an attractive target for immunotherapy, since it is an essential driver gene and 4 bp frameshift insertions occur in the same hotspot in 30%-35% of AMLs, resulting in a C-terminal alternative reading frame of 11 aa. By searching the HLA class I ligandome of primary AMLs, we identified multiple DeltaNPM1-derived peptides. For one of these peptides, HLA-A*02:01-binding CLAVEEVSL, we searched for specific T cells in healthy individuals using peptide-HLA tetramers. Tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells were isolated and analyzed for reactivity against primary AMLs. From one clone with superior antitumor reactivity, we isolated the T cell receptor (TCR) and demonstrated specific recognition and lysis of HLA-A*02:01-positive DeltaNPM1 AML after retroviral transfer to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Antitumor efficacy of TCR-transduced T cells was confirmed in immunodeficient mice engrafted with a human AML cell line expressing DeltaNPM1. In conclusion, the data show that DeltaNPM1-derived peptides are presented on AML and that CLAVEEVSL is a neoantigen that can be efficiently targeted on AML by DeltaNPM1 TCR gene transfer. Immunotherapy targeting DeltaNPM1 may therefore contribute to treatment of AML.","['van der Lee, Dyantha I', 'Reijmers, Rogier M', 'Honders, Maria W', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'de Jong, Rob Cm', 'Kester, Michel Gd', 'van der Steen, Dirk M', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'Kweekel, Christiaan', 'Bijen, Helena M', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam Hm', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Griffioen, Marieke']","['van der Lee DI', 'Reijmers RM', 'Honders MW', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'de Jong RC', 'Kester MG', 'van der Steen DM', 'de Ru AH', 'Kweekel C', 'Bijen HM', 'Jedema I', 'Veelken H', 'van Veelen PA', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Griffioen M']",,"['Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Peptides/genetics/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6355238,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['97482 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI97482 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Feb 1;129(2):774-785. doi: 10.1172/JCI97482.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify SCs using the ratings of occurrence, severity, and distress in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients at three stages of their induction therapy (i.e., T1, T2, and T3). Then, we evaluated the consensus among the numbers and types of symptoms in each SC identified by multiple dimensions over time. METHOD: The Chinese version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale was used to evaluate the occurrence, severity, and distress ratings of 32 symptoms in patients newly diagnosed with AML during their induction therapy. Exploratory factor analysis was used for SCs identification. RESULTS: Using the three dimensions in the AML patients (n = 126), four SCs were identified at T1 and T3 and three SCs were identified at T2. The number of symptoms in individual SCs varied over time, whereas the specific symptoms in SCs remained similar over time. The severity ratings fit the data better than did the ratings of occurrence and distress. CONCLUSION: These findings provided insights into the most common SCs in AML patients undergoing induction therapy by multidimensional evaluation and could lay the foundation for future targeted symptom interventions. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms of SCs in AML patients undergoing the chemotherapy.","['Lin, Dong-Mei', 'Yin, Xi-Xi', 'Wang, Ning', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Wen, Yan-Ping', 'Meng, Li-Min', 'Zhang, Li-Li']","['Lin DM', 'Yin XX', 'Wang N', 'Zheng W', 'Wen YP', 'Meng LM', 'Zhang LL']",,"['School of Nursing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.

We show that TGF-beta2 drives expression of catalase to reduce the amount of H2O2 produced by T. annulata-transformed bovine macrophages, as well as by human lung (A549) and colon cancer (HT-29) cell lines. Theileria-transformed macrophages attenuated for dissemination express less catalase and produce more H2O2, but regain both virulent migratory and matrigel traversal phenotypes when stimulated either with TGF-beta2, or catalase to reduce H2O2 output. Increased H2O2 output therefore, underpins the aggressive dissemination phenotype of diverse tumour cell types, but in contrast, too much H2O2 can dampen dissemination.","['Haidar, Malak', 'Metheni, Mehdi', 'Batteux, Frederic', 'Langsley, Gordon']","['Haidar M', 'Metheni M', 'Batteux F', 'Langsley G']",,"['Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris 75014 France; Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris 75014 France; Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris 75014 France; Laboratoire de Stress Oxydant, Proliferation Cellulaire et Inflammation, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris 75014 France; Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.

The goal of this study is to identify the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may affect the expression levels of ABCA3; the previously identified prognostic biomarker for multidrug resistance (MDR) in childhood ALL (cALL). Bone marrow samples from 64 cALLs, including 46 de novo and 18 relapsed patients, in addition to 30 non-cancer controls were collected, and ncRNAs were nominated using in silico studies. Quantitative RT-PCR showed low expression profiles of miR-335-3p in cALLs compared with the control group (P=0.018). Inverse correlation was determined between the miR-335-3p and ABCA3 mRNA expression profiles in cALL patients (r=0.5019, P=0.002). Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of miR-335-3p was downregulated in the drug-resistant samples (MDR group) compared with the drug-sensitive patients (mrd- group), (P=0.0005, AUC=0.801). On the other hand, negative correlations were identified between the expression levels of miR-335-3p and the selected LncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1, in the MDR group compared with the mrd- patients (P=0.009), suggesting a sponge effect for these LncRNAs. The current study showed a potential regulatory role for miR-335-3p in ABCA3 expression targeted by NEAT1 and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs. This negative impact may possibly contribute to the development of chemoresistance in childhood ALL, and provide an exceptional insight to new therapeutic approaches.","['Pouyanrad, Shahrzad', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Ghodousi, Elaheh Sadat']","['Pouyanrad S', 'Rahgozar S', 'Ghodousi ES']",,"['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.

Although it has been reported that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) causes more severe chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells and is highly expressed in chemoresistant ovarian cancer, the molecular mechanism underlying this dysregulation is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of XIAP and have a role in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Using in silico analysis and literature review, a panel of miRNAs dysregulated in chemoresistant ovarian cancer was generated from hundreds of miRNAs that were predicted to target the XIAP 3'UTR. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay and cellular co-transfection of a miRNA expression vector and a luciferase reporter fused to the XIAP 3'UTR cognate miRNA binding site, we identified three miRNAs of which miR-142-5p had the greatest inhibitory effect. We found that overexpression of miR-142-5p suppressed XIAP expression by binding to its 3'UTR in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells. Using a chemosensitivity assay, we found that in OVCAR3, SKOV3, and primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, overexpression or inhibition of miR-142-5p increased or suppressed their sensitivities to cisplatin respectively. In contrast, introducing XIAP without a 3'UTR counteracted the effect of overexpressed miR-142-5p on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between miR-142-5p expression and XIAP protein levels in clinical samples from patients with EOC. Using clinical and miRNA expression data of more than 200 ovarian cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found ovarian cancer patients with higher expression levels of miR-142-5p had longer median progression-free survival as compared to patients with lower miR-142-5p levels. We demonstrated that miR-142-5p also targeted four other anti-apoptotic genes, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), BCL2 like 2 (BCL2L2), and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) specifically. Transcriptome sequencing shed light on the essential apoptosis-related pathway in which miR-142-5p may be involved. To conclude, our findings illustrate that miR-142-5p sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting multiple anti-apoptotic genes including XIAP, and may also suggest the therapeutic potential of miR-142-5p in ovarian cancer treatment.","['Li, Xiaodi', 'Chen, Wei', 'Jin, Yuhao', 'Xue, Renxing', 'Su, Jiancheng', 'Mu, Zekun', 'Li, Jiamin', 'Jiang, Songshan']","['Li X', 'Chen W', 'Jin Y', 'Xue R', 'Su J', 'Mu Z', 'Li J', 'Jiang S']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-leukemic property of small molecule inhibitor of c-Myc 10058-F4 in two distinct acute leukemia cell lines consist of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells (with wild-type PTEN) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-derived Nalm-6 cells (with down-regulated PTEN). 10058-F4 effectively reduced survival of leukemic cells; however, we found a different cell sensitivity pattern in the tested cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the underlying mechanisms responsible for leukemic cell resistance to 10058-F4, and we propose for the first time that the effectiveness of c-Myc inhibition might be attenuated through over-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in less sensitive Nalm-6 cells. Notably, we failed to find an obvious correlation between PTEN status and cell sensitivity to the inhibitor in a panel of hematologic malignant cells. Beyond 10058-F4 cytotoxicity as a single agent, synergistic experiments also delineated that pharmaceutical targeting of c-Myc could potentiate the anti-cancer effect of both vincristine and Arsenic trioxide in ALL and APL cells, respectively. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potent anti-leukemic characteristics of 10058-F4 and provide an interesting evidence to the application of this agent in combination with PI3K inhibitors especially in acute leukemia with over-activated PI3K, irrespective of PTEN status.","['Bashash, Davood', 'Sayyadi, Mohamad', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Sheikh-Zeineddini, Negar', 'Riyahi, Niknam', 'Momeny, Majid']","['Bashash D', 'Sayyadi M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Sheikh-Zeineddini N', 'Riyahi N', 'Momeny M']",,"['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Nutritional morbidities are a persistent problem facing pediatric patients during and after treatment and age-gender groups that are at risk for nutritional conditions have not been clearly identified. Therapy is a contributing factor; however, the role of dietary intake remains largely unknown. Prior to conduct of interventional trials, an understanding of the effects of treatment on fluctuations in dietary intake is necessary. METHODS: We enrolled 794 children with ALL in a prospective clinical trial. Dietary intake was collected with a food frequency questionnaire at diagnosis and throughout the course of treatment for pediatric ALL. Reported values were compared to the Dietary Recommended Intake (DRI), and normative values (NHANES). Hierarchical linear models and multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models were used to evaluate longitudinal changes in dietary intake; independent samples t-test with Bonferroni correction was performed to compare to NHANES. RESULTS: Of the evaluable participants at each timepoint, dietary intake was obtained on 81% (n = 640), 74% (n = 580) and 74% (n = 558) at diagnosis, end of induction phase of treatment, and continuation, respectively. Despite exposure to corticosteroids, caloric intake decreased over therapy for most age-gender groups. Predictive models of excess intake found reduced odds of over-consuming calories (OR 0.738, P < 0.05); however, increased odds of over-consuming fat (OR 6.971, P < 0.001). When compared to NHANES, we consistently found that >/=1/3 of children were consuming calories in excess of normative values. For select micronutrients, a small proportion of participants were above or below the DRI at each time evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that dietary intake fluctuates during treatment for ALL as compared to age-gender recommended and normative values. Improving our understanding of nutrient fluctuations and dietary quality will facilitate subsequent analyses addressing relationships of dietary intake, toxicity, and survival.","['Ladas, Elena J', 'Orjuela, Manuela', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Lin, Meiko', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Welch, Jennifer Greene', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Ladas EJ', 'Orjuela M', 'Stevenson K', 'Cole PD', 'Lin M', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Leclerc JM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Welch JG', 'Asselin BL', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Kelly KM']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States; Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, United States; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, United States.

To make evidence-based recommendations to Canadian dairy producers and their consultants regarding cost and financial benefits of BLV on-farm control, an economic model that takes the supply-managed milk quota system into account is necessary. Alberta-specific input variables were used for the presented analysis. A decision tree model program was used to evaluate economic aspects of decreasing a 40% BLV within-herd prevalence on dairy farms by implementing various control strategies over 10 yr. Investigated strategies were (1) all management strategies, including 3 options for colostrum management; (2) some management strategies; (3) test and cull; and (4) test and segregate. Each of these strategies was compared with a no control on-farm approach. The prevalence for this no-control approach was assumed to stay constant over time. Each control strategy incurred specific yearly cost and yielded yearly decreases in prevalence, thereby affecting yearly partial net revenue. Infection with BLV was assumed to decrease milk production, decrease cow longevity, and increase condemnation of carcasses at slaughter from cattle with enzootic bovine leukosis, thereby decreasing net revenue. Cows infected with BLV generated a yearly mean partial net revenue of Can$7,641, whereas noninfected cows generated Can$8,276. Mean cost for the control strategies ranged from Can$193 to Can$847 per animal over 10 yr in a 146-animal herd. Net benefits of controlling BLV on farm, as compared with not controlling BLV, per cow in a 146-animal herd over a 10-yr period for each strategy was: Can$1,315 for all management strategies (freezer); Can$1,243 for all management strategies (pasteurizer); Can$785 for all management strategies (powdered colostrum); Can$1,028 for some management strategies; Can$1,592 for test and cull; and Can$1,594 for test and segregate. Consequently, on-farm BLV control was financially beneficial. Even though negative net benefits were possible and expected for some iterations, our sensitivity analysis highlighted the overall robustness of our model. In summary, this model provided evidence that Canadian dairy farmers should be encouraged to control BLV on their farm.","['Kuczewski, Alessa', 'Hogeveen, Henk', 'Orsel, Karin', 'Wolf, Robert', 'Thompson, Jada', 'Spackman, Eldon', 'van der Meer, Frank']","['Kuczewski A', 'Hogeveen H', 'Orsel K', 'Wolf R', 'Thompson J', 'Spackman E', 'van der Meer F']",,"['Department of Ecosystem and Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada T2N 4N1.

A minimal residual disease (MRD) before transplantation is a major part of prognosis. Blinatumomab, a bispecific antibody CD19(+)/CD3(+), allowed to achieve a cytologic and molecular complete remission in adults with refractory B-precursor ALL. This retrospective study analyses results from a pediatric cohort treated by blinatumomab thanks to an interregional structuring consortium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients between 0 and 23 years old, from the 7 centers of the french ""Grand Ouest"" interregional network, treated by blinatumomab for a relapsed or refractory ALL, from January 2015 to January 2018, were included. The efficiency of blinatumomab was assessed in terms of complete remission, minimal residual disease, overall survival, and tolerability of treatment. RESULTS: Thirteen of 18 patients achieved a complete remission, with negative minimal residual disease for ten of them. Fourteen patients proceeded to stem cell transplantation,. Eight out of 14 patients obtained long term remission after HSCT. As far as tolerance is concerned, no serious adverse event, neurological or psychiatric disorder, was observed. CONCLUSION: Thanks to an interregional network collaboration, all children with high risk ALL coming from the western french interregion could be treated by blinatumomab. Blinatumomab offered good hematological conditions to undergo HSCT with a good tolerability.","['Camuset, Margaux', 'Grain, Audrey', 'Lorton, Fleur', 'Minckes, Odile', 'Jourdain, Anne', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Battisti, Fanny Rialland']","['Camuset M', 'Grain A', 'Lorton F', 'Minckes O', 'Jourdain A', 'Millot F', 'Pellier I', 'Gandemer V', 'Battisti FR']",,"[""Hemato-immuno-oncologie pediatrique, CHU de Nantes, 5, allee de l'ile-Gloriette, 44093 Nantes cedex 01, France.

The association of TSGA10 gene expression with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and angiogenic factors has remained to be fully elucidated and is still a controversial issue. The present study was designed to investigate this association in patients newly diagnosed with AML. METHODS: We evaluated TSGA10, HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA levels in ND AML patients and healthy subjects using real-time PCR technique. Data were analyzed via comparative Livak method. RESULTS: Based on the results of this study, TSGA10 gene expression was decreased in 28 out of 30 (93.3%) samples while VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression levels were increased in all ND AML patients compared to healthy controls. Diagnostic evaluation was performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) calculation. Respectively, using cut-off relative quantification of 1.604, 0.0329, and 0.0042, the sensitivity values of TSGA10, VEGF, and HIF-1alpha gene expression were 86.7%, 90%, and 100%. Also, specificity values were 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively. TSGA10 expression was shown to be reduced in ND AML patients compared with healthy subjects and we found a negative correlation between TSGA10 and VEGF expression. CONCLUSIONS: Since TSGA10 interacts with HIF-1 and affects its transcriptional activity, in ND AML patients with decreased TSGA10 expression, VEGF expression was high suggesting a TSGA10 mediated regulation of HIF-1 target genes. Altogether, the current study showed that TSGA10 could be considered as a tumor suppressor in AML patients.","['Hoseinkhani, Zohreh', 'Rastegari-Pouyani, Mohsen', 'Oubari, Farhad', 'Mozafari, Hadi', 'Rahimzadeh, Amir Bahman', 'Maleki, Ali', 'Amini, Saeideh', 'Mansouri, Kamran']","['Hoseinkhani Z', 'Rastegari-Pouyani M', 'Oubari F', 'Mozafari H', 'Rahimzadeh AB', 'Maleki A', 'Amini S', 'Mansouri K']",,"['Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.

In addition, it is implicated in leukemogenesis via its effect on leukemic stem cells. This study aimed to characterize the expression pattern of SALL4 gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at different progression phases of the leukemic process and to assess its prognostic significance. Real-time PCR was used in 106 patients: 54 AML patients; 43 de novo and 11 in complete remission (CR), 52 CML patients; 31 in chronic phase (CP), 11 in deep molecular response (MR(4)) and 10 in accelerated/blastic phase (AP/BP); and in 21 nonmalignant bone marrow samples. SALL4 gene expression was elevated in AML, AML-CR and CML-CP (median = 5.180, 4.604 and 14.125 fold changes, respectively).

Abnormal c-KIT overexpression is considered an independent negative prognostic factor for relapse and survival in t(8;21) AML patients. However, the molecular mechanism of high c-KIT expression in t(8;21) AML remains unknown. In this study, we detected RUNX1-ETO and c-KIT gene expression in AML-M2 patients and verified the overexpression of c-KIT in t(8;21) AML patients. We also found that c-KIT overexpression was a poor prognostic indicator in RUNX1-ETO positive AML patients, but not in RUNX1-ETO negative AML patients. We used the dual-luciferase and ChIP assays to demonstrate that the RUNX1-ETO protein epigenetically trans-activates c-KIT by binding to the c-KIT promoter and recruiting the histone acetyltransferase P300 to the c-KIT promoter, elucidating the mechanism of the abnormally increased c-KIT expression in t(8;21) AML patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies revealed that C646, a P300 inhibitor, could inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle more effectively in RUNX1-ETO positive cells than in negative ones. The levels of c-KIT and RUNX1-ETO proteins were also decreased with C646 treatment in RUNX1-ETO positive cells. These findings suggested that P300 could be a therapeutic target and that C646 could be used as a potential treatment for RUNX1-ETO positive AML patients. Interestingly, using the dual-luciferase assay, we also found that the binding capacity of RUNX1-ETO9a, a truncated RUNX1-ETO isoform, to the c-KIT promoter was stronger than that of RUNX1-ETO, suggesting RUNX1-ETO9a as another valuable therapeutic target in t(8;21) AML.","['Chen, Guofeng', 'Liu, Anqi', 'Xu, Yihan', 'Gao, Li', 'Jiang, Mengmeng', 'Li, Yan', 'Lv, Na', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yu, Li', 'Li, Yonghui']","['Chen G', 'Liu A', 'Xu Y', 'Gao L', 'Jiang M', 'Li Y', 'Lv N', 'Zhou L', 'Wang L', 'Yu L', 'Li Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6782-7473'],"['School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Intensive Care Unit, Beijing Electric Power Hospital, National Electric Net Ltd., Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 202 Hospital of PLA, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Kidney Diseases, Beijing Key Laboratory of Kidney Disease, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0', '(4-(4-((5-(4,5-dimethyl-2-nitrophenyl)-2-furanyl)methylene)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-', '5-oxo-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrazolones)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RUNX1-IT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Nitrobenzenes', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrazolones', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14751 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2019 Mar;286(5):901-912. doi: 10.1111/febs.14751.

The glycomic especially the sialoglycomic aspect of these HSCs has been unravelled in this study. Cell surface expression of the glycans with the related enzymatic activities has been compared with the BM of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a common BM-associated malignancy. An enhanced cell surface expression of alpha2,3-linked sialic acid, P- and E-selectins, and intercellular adhesion molecule along with reduced expression of L-selectin distinguishes CD34(+) HSCs of UCB from leukaemic samples. More importantly, high expression of O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins, a hallmark of lymphoblasts, is drastically reduced in the CD34(+) HSCs of UCB and is substantiated by the low activity of sialylate-O-acetyltransferase and high sialidase activity. In contrast, a significant variation is evident in the expression of sialic acid, alpha2,6-linked sialic acids, and the sialyltransferase activity. Taken together, these studies indicate a few signature molecules, forming a unique glycomic template, which may be a potential indicator, reassuring the normal profile of these stem cells, to be used for future transplantation.","['Chowdhury, Suchandra', 'Bhattacharya, Kaushik', 'Mandal, Chandan', 'Mondal, Susmita', 'Sarkar, Sayantani', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Banerjee, Subir', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Chowdhury S', 'Bhattacharya K', 'Mandal C', 'Mondal S', 'Sarkar S', 'Chandra S', 'Banerjee S', 'Mandal C']",,"['Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Clinical Haematology Service, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Anaesthesiology and critical care, Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, India.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India. cmandal@iicb.res.in.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', '*Glycomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Sialic Acids/chemistry']",,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/07/31 06:00,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-3065-0_21 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1112:309-318. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-3065-0_21.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell', 'Cell adhesion molecules', 'Glycomics', 'Sialic acid', 'Sialidase', 'Sialylate-O-acetyltransferase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies established the irregular over expression of specific genes is a common finding in patients with AML. The ectopic viral integration site-1 (EVI1) gene is a protooncogene subject to alternative splicing, and encodes a zincfinger protein that acts as a transcriptional regulator in early devel opment. Forced overexpression of EVI1 in hematopoietic progenitors later induced a myeloid differentiation block. The current review aimed at determining the prognos tic value of EVI1 expression in patients with AML in the age range of one month to fifteen years. The scientific databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Scopus, and ISI published up to January 2016 were searched using the conformity keywords and a total of four articles were studied. Three articles declared higher overexpression of EVI1 in patients with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements. The percentage of overall survival (OS), reported in two articles, decreased in AML patients with high EVI1 expression. A study reported that the relationship between EVI1 expression and OS was negligible in cases with and without EVI1 expression. Another study showed significant differences in event free survival (EFS) and OS in the group of patients with positive MLL-AF9 between EVI1+ and EVI1patients. The current study revealed that high EVI1 expression was not a poor prognostic factor in pediatric patients with AML. And this gene expression was mainly prognostic concomitantly by other factors such as MLL rearrangement, MEL1 expression, and white blood cell (WBC) count.","['Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Rezaei Dezaki, Zahra']","['Sadeghian MH', 'Rezaei Dezaki Z']",,"['Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Iran,Iran J Pathol,Iranian journal of pathology,101515128,,,,PMC6322524,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/01/15 06:01,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pathol. 2018 Summer;13(3):294-300.

In this study, we tried to explore the physiological role of CD59 in T-ALL. Methods: In this study, we collected the bone marrow samples from 17 T-ALL patients and 38 healthy participants to find differences in CD59 expression patterns. Then, CD59 was over-expressed in T-ALL cell line Jurkat, and its biological functions were detected. In addition, in order to understand the active site of CD59, the Trp40 was mutated. Further, we constructed a mouse model by transplanting Jurkat cells into the nude mice to verify the function of CD59 in vitro. At last, mechanism studies were performed by western blot. Results: We found that the proportion of T lymphocytes expressing CD59 in bone marrow of T-ALL patients was significantly higher than that of healthy individuals. Then, we found that the overexpression of CD59 in Jurkat cells was beneficial to the cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting IL-2 secretion. In this process, Trp40 of CD59 was a key functional site. Further, the high expression of CD59 inhibited apoptosis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, and promoted IL-2 secretion in mouse model. At last, mechanism studies showed that the activation of AKT, STAT5 and Notch1 signaling pathways in Jurkat cells, may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis by CD59; and mutation in the Trp40 affect the interaction of CD59 with these signaling pathways. Conclusions: In conclusion, CD59 inhibited apoptosis of T-ALL by regulating AKT/Notch1 signaling pathway, providing a new perspective for the treatment of T-ALL.","['Jia, Yanfei', 'Qi, Yan', 'Wang, Yunshan', 'Ma, Xiaoli', 'Xu, Yihui', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhang, Xiaoqian', 'Gao, Meihua', 'Cong, Beibei', 'Han, Shuyi']","['Jia Y', 'Qi Y', 'Wang Y', 'Ma X', 'Xu Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Gao M', 'Cong B', 'Han S']",,"[""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""2Department of Clinical Laboratory, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, Shandong People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1761 4893grid.415468.a"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""2Department of Clinical Laboratory, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, Shandong People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1761 4893grid.415468.a"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1"", ""1Medical Research and Laboratory Diagnostic Center, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 115 Jie Fang Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013 People's Republic of China.grid.452222.1""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6325688,,2019/01/15 06:00,2019/01/15 06:01,['2019/01/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-018-0714-9 [doi]', '714 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Jan 8;19:9. doi: 10.1186/s12935-018-0714-9. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Apoptosis', 'CD59', 'Notch1', 'T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,20190108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also the mutational landscapes of both entities show congruencies. We analyzed and compared an aCML cohort (n = 26) and a CMML cohort (n = 59) by next-generation sequencing of 25 genes and by an nCounter approach for differential expression in 107 genes. Significant differences were found with regard to the mutation frequency of TET2, SETBP1, and CSF3R. Blast content of the bone marrow revealed an inverse correlation with the mutation status of SETBP1 in aCML and TET2 in CMML, respectively. By linear discriminant analysis, a mutation-based machine learning algorithm was generated which placed 19/26 aCML cases (73%) and 54/59 (92%) CMML cases into the correct category. After multiple correction, differential mRNA expression could be detected between both cohorts in a subset of genes (FLT3, CSF3R, and SETBP1 showed the strongest correlation). However, due to high variances in the mRNA expression, the potential utility for the clinic is limited.

The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence, clinical course, and management of calculous and acalculous acute cholecystitis in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: A single center's database was queried for all patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis from January 1, 2003 to September 30, 2016 with concomitant diagnosis of neutropenia, leukopenia, leukemia, or lymphoma. These cases subsequently underwent chart review. Data on demographics, diagnostic studies, and management were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 4525 patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis during the study window. One hundred twenty patients were identified to be immunocompromised at time of diagnosis. Seventy-nine patients (65.8%) had acute calculous cholecystitis while 41 patients (34.2%) had acalculous cholecystitis. There were no significant demographic differences between calculous and acalculous groups. There was similar use of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (7.6%, 9.8%, p = 0.69), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (70.9%, 61.0%, p = 0.27), and open cholecystectomy (10.3%, 2.4%, p = 0.13) in both calculous and acalculous groups. DISCUSSION: While immunosuppression is commonly thought to be associated with acalculous cholecystitis, our data suggest the majority of acute cholecystitis in immunocompromised patients are calculous. Most patients in our studies were managed successfully with laparoscopic cholecystectomy with acceptably low complication rates.

Trial SCMC-AML-2009 presented herein was a randomized clinical study designed based on our previous findings that pediatric AML patients younger than two years old may benefit from HHT-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients randomized to arm A were treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen comprising mainly of anthracyclines and cytarabine (Ara-C), whereas patients in arm B were treated with HHT-containing regimens in which anthracyclines in all but the initial induction therapy were replaced by HHT. From February 2009 to November 2015, 59 patients less than 2 years old with de novo AML (other than acute promyelocytic leukemia) were recruited. A total of 42 patients achieved a morphologic complete remission (CR) after the first course, with similar rates in both arms (70.6% vs.72.0%). At the end of the follow-up period, 40 patients remained in CR and 5 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in CR, which could not be considered as events but censors. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 60.2%+/-9.6% for arm A and 88.0%+/-6.5% for arm B (P= 0.024). Patients in arm B experienced shorter durations of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia and had a lower risk of infection during consolidation chemotherapy with high-dosage Ara-C. Consequently, the homoharringtonine-based regimen achieved excellent EFS and alleviated hematologic toxicity for children aged younger than 2 years with de novo AML compared with the anthracycline-based regimen.","['Chen, Xiaoxiao', 'Tang, Yanjing', 'Chen, Jing', 'Chen, Ru', 'Gu, Longjun', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Pan, Ci', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Shen, Shuhong']","['Chen X', 'Tang Y', 'Chen J', 'Chen R', 'Gu L', 'Xue H', 'Pan C', 'Tang J', 'Shen S']",,"[""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China. tangjingyan@scmc.com.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China. shenshuhong@scmc.com.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'China', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Homoharringtonine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Remission Induction']",,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11684-018-0658-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-018-0658-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Front Med. 2019 Jun;13(3):378-387. doi: 10.1007/s11684-018-0658-4.

Thirty patients with Ph+ ALL were recruited. Standard induction chemotherapy was given for 4 weeks. Nilotinib was administered beginning on day 15 of induction. After achieving hematologic complete remission (HCR), patients received either seven courses of consolidation or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Nilotinib was continued 2 years after achieving HCR or before stem cell transplantation conditioning. HCR and molecular complete response (MCR), overall survival (OS), hematologic relapse-free survival (HRFS), molecular relapse-free survival (MRFS), toxicity, and nilotinib levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid were evaluated. All patients achieved HCR, and cumulative MCR rate was 83.3%. The median HRFS and OS were 18 and 47.5 months, respectively. Four-year HRFS and OS rates were 54% and 45%, respectively. The median MRFS and 4-year MRFS for the patients with MCR were 19 months and 45%, respectively. The molecular response of patients after induction cycle had no impact on HRFS, MRFS, or OS. The patients who achieved MCR after 3 and 6 months had superior HRFS. The HCT cohort in the first HCR had significantly lower rates of relapse and longer MRFS, HRFS, and OS. Most adverse events were reversible with dose reduction or transient interruption of nilotinib therapy. Only traces of nilotinib were detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Nilotinib combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy was effective and translated to a high HCR and MCR for patients with Ph+ ALL. It should be noted that nilotinib cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.","['Liu, Bingcheng', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhou, Chunlin', 'Wei, Hui', 'Lin, Dong', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Kaiqi', 'Zhang, Guangji', 'Wei, Shuning', 'Li, Yan', 'Gong, Benfa', 'Liu, Yuntao', 'Gong, Xiaoyuan', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Liu B', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou C', 'Wei H', 'Lin D', 'Li W', 'Liu K', 'Zhang G', 'Wei S', 'Li Y', 'Gong B', 'Liu Y', 'Gong X', 'Mi Y', 'Wang J']",,"['Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Luekemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, 300020, China. wangjx@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['81430004/State Key Program of National Natural Science of China', '15ZXLCSY00010/Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases', '81670159/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '15JCYBJC25700, 15JCYBJC25000/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin']",['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03594-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03594-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Mar;98(3):633-645. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03594-1.

In chronic viral infections, anti-tumor T cell responses can be compromised due to various immunological mechanisms, including T cell exhaustion. To study mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity during a chronic viral infection, we made use of the well-established Friend virus (FV) mouse model. Chronically FV-infected mice are impaired in their ability to reject FBL-3 cells-a virus-induced tumor cell line of C57BL/6 origin. Here we aimed to explore therapeutic strategies to overcome the influence of T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection, and reactivate effector CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells to eliminate tumor cells. For T cell stimulation, agonistic antibodies against the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members CD137 and CD134 were used, because they were reported to augment the cytotoxic program of T cells. alphaCD137 agonistic therapy, but not alphaCD134 agonistic therapy, resulted in FBL-3 tumor elimination in chronically FV-infected mice. CD137 stimulation significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which were both required for efficient tumor control. Our study suggests that agonistic antibodies to CD137 can efficiently enhance anti-tumor immunity even in the setting of chronic viral infection, which might have promising therapeutic applications.","['Malyshkina, Anna', 'Littwitz-Salomon, Elisabeth', 'Sutter, Kathrin', 'Ross, Jean Alexander', 'Paschen, Annette', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Malyshkina A', 'Littwitz-Salomon E', 'Sutter K', 'Ross JA', 'Paschen A', 'Windmann S', 'Schimmer S', 'Dittmer U']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5199-5472'],"['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany. anna.malyshkina@uk-essen.de.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstrasse 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['2014.091.1/Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunologic Surveillance', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Receptors, OX40/agonists', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/*agonists']",,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/03/29 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-019-02300-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-019-02300-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2019 Mar;68(3):479-488. doi: 10.1007/s00262-019-02300-4.

We used multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to study the immune contexture in adult precursor B cell ALL bone marrow (BM). In addition, we developed a multivariate risk prediction model that stratified a poor survival group based on clinical parameters and mIHC data. We analyzed BM biopsy samples of ALL patients (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 14) using mIHC with 30 different immunophenotype markers and computerized image analysis. In ALL BM, the proportions of M1-like macrophages, granzyme B+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and CD27+ T cells were decreased, whereas the proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2-like macrophages were increased. Also, the expression of checkpoint molecules PD1 and CTLA4 was elevated. In the multivariate model, age, platelet count, and the proportion of PD1+TIM3+ double-positive CD4+ T cells differentiated a poor survival group. These results were validated by flow cytometry in a separate cohort (n = 31). In conclusion, the immune cell contexture in ALL BM differs from healthy controls. CD4+PD1+TIM3+ T cells were independent predictors of poor outcome in our multivariate risk model, suggesting that PD1 might serve as an attractive immuno-oncological target in B-ALL.","['Hohtari, Helena', 'Bruck, Oscar', 'Blom, Sami', 'Turkki, Riku', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta', 'Kovanen, Panu E', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Pellinen, Teijo', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Hohtari H', 'Bruck O', 'Blom S', 'Turkki R', 'Sinisalo M', 'Kovanen PE', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Pellinen T', 'Porkka K', 'Mustjoki S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0816-8241'],"['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'HUSLAB, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland. satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6755974,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0360-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0360-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1570-1582. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0360-1.

TP53 mutated patients had even fewer co-mutated genes but were enriched for the del(5q) chromosomal abnormality (p < 0.005), monosomal karyotype (p < 0.001), and high complexity, defined as more than 4 cytogenetic abnormalities (p < 0.001). Monosomal karyotype, high complexity, and TP53 mutation were individually associated with shorter overall survival, but monosomal status was not significant in a multivariable model. Multivariable survival modeling identified severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL), NRAS mutation, SF3B1 mutation, TP53 mutation, elevated blast percentage (>10%), abnormal 3q, abnormal 9, and monosomy 7 as having the greatest survival risk. The poor risk associated with CK-MDS is driven by its association with prognostically adverse TP53 mutations and can be refined by considering clinical and karyotype features.","['Haase, Detlef', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'List, Alan F', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Padron, Eric', 'Sallman, David', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Savona, Michael R', 'Seegmiller, Adam', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Bowen, David', 'Groves, Michael J', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Steensma, David', 'Stone, Richard', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Ganster, Christina', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Quek, Lynn', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Tuchler, Heinz', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Bejar, Rafael']","['Haase D', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg D', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Nazha A', 'Sekeres MA', 'Ebert BL', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Ogawa S', 'Nagata Y', 'Yoshida K', 'Graubert TA', 'Walter MJ', 'List AF', 'Komrokji RS', 'Padron E', 'Sallman D', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Campbell PJ', 'Savona MR', 'Seegmiller A', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Shih LY', 'Bowen D', 'Groves MJ', 'Tauro S', 'Fontenay M', 'Kosmider O', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Steensma D', 'Stone R', 'Heuser M', 'Thol F', 'Cazzola M', 'Malcovati L', 'Karsan A', 'Ganster C', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Boultwood J', 'Pellagatti A', 'Santini V', 'Quek L', 'Vyas P', 'Tuchler H', 'Greenberg PL', 'Bejar R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2566-3145', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7753-1091', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3763-5504', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1866-7922', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6122-0221', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3931-0914', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5603-4598']","['University Medical Center, Georg- August-University, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'H.

MLL-rearranged (MLLr) B-ALL (MLLr-B-ALL) has, however, an unfavorable prognosis with common therapy refractoriness and early relapse, and therefore new therapeutic targets are needed for relapsed/refractory MLLr-B-ALL. MLLr leukemias are characterized by the specific expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4, also known as neuron-glial antigen-2 (NG2). NG2 was recently shown involved in leukemia invasiveness and central nervous system infiltration in MLLr-B-ALL, and correlated with lower event-free survival (EFS). We here hypothesized that blocking NG2 may synergize with established induction therapy for B-ALL based on vincristine, glucocorticoids, and L-asparaginase (VxL). Using robust patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we found that NG2 is crucial for MLLr-B-ALL engraftment upon intravenous (i.v.) transplantation. In vivo blockade of NG2 using either chondroitinase-ABC or an anti-NG2-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) resulted in a significant mobilization of MLLr-B-ALL blasts from bone marrow (BM) to peripheral blood (PB) as demonstrated by cytometric and 3D confocal imaging analysis. When combined with either NG2 antagonist, VxL treatment achieved higher rates of complete remission, and consequently higher EFS and delayed time to relapse. Mechanistically, anti-NG2 MoAb induces neither antibody-dependent cell-mediated not complement-dependent cytotoxicity. NG2 blockade rather overrides BM stroma-mediated chemoprotection through PB mobilization of MLLr-B-ALL blasts, thus becoming more accessible to chemotherapy. We provide a proof of concept for NG2 as a therapeutic target for MLLr-B-ALL.","['Lopez-Millan, Belen', 'Sanchez-Martinez, Diego', 'Roca-Ho, Heleia', 'Gutierrez-Aguera, Francisco', 'Molina, Oscar', 'Diaz de la Guardia, Rafael', 'Torres-Ruiz, Raul', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Suessbier, Ute', 'Nombela-Arrieta, Cesar', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Lopez-Millan B', 'Sanchez-Martinez D', 'Roca-Ho H', 'Gutierrez-Aguera F', 'Molina O', 'Diaz de la Guardia R', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Fuster JL', 'Ballerini P', 'Suessbier U', 'Nombela-Arrieta C', 'Bueno C', 'Menendez P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0415-259X'],"['Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. blopez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Section, Hospital Clinico Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hematology, Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital-University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital-University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. cbueno@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red-Oncologia (CIBERONC), Zurich, Switzerland. cbueno@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red-Oncologia (CIBERONC), Zurich, Switzerland. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6755967,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0353-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0353-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1557-1569. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0353-0.

We performed comprehensive genetic analyses of plasma cells in 20 patients with POEMS syndrome. Whole exome sequencing was performed in 11 cases and found a total of 308 somatic mutations in 285 genes. Targeted sequencing was performed in all 20 cases and identified 20 mutations in 7 recurrently mutated genes, namely KLHL6, LTB, EHD1, EML4, HEPHL1, HIPK1, and PCDH10. None of the driver gene mutations frequently found in multiple myeloma (MM) such as NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 was detected. Copy number analysis showed chromosomal abnormalities shared with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), suggesting a partial overlap in the early development of MGUS and POEMS syndrome. RNA sequencing revealed a transcription profile specific to POEMS syndrome when compared with normal plasma cells, MGUS and MM. Unexpectedly, disease-specific VEGFA expression was not increased in POEMS syndrome. Our study illustrates that the genetic and transcriptional profiles of plasma cells in POEMS syndrome are distinct from MM and MGUS, indicating unique function of clonal plasma cells in its pathogenesis.","['Nagao, Yuhei', 'Mimura, Naoya', 'Takeda, June', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Koide, Shuhei', 'Rizq, Ola',

Here, we evaluated the clinical and molecular features of KIT D816(mut)/CBF-negative (CBF(neg)) AML, a previously uncharacterized combination. All KIT D816(mut)/CBF(neg) cases (n = 40) had histologically proven SM with associated AML (SM-AML). Molecular analyses revealed at least one additional somatic mutation (median, n = 3) beside KIT D816 (e.g., SRSF2, 38%; ASXL1, 31%; RUNX1, 34%) in 32/32 (100%) patients. Secondary AML evolved in 29/40 (73%) patients from SM +/- associated myeloid neoplasm. Longitudinal molecular and cytogenetic analyses revealed the acquisition of new mutations and/or karyotype evolution in 15/16 (94%) patients at the time of SM-AML. Median overall survival (OS) was 5.4 months. A screen of two independent AML databases (AML(databases)) revealed remarkable similarities between KIT D816(mut)/CBF(neg) SM-AML and KIT D816(mut)/CBF(neg) AML(databases) (n = 69) with regard to KIT D816(mut) variant allele frequency, mutation profile, aberrant karyotype, and OS suggesting underlying SM in a significant proportion of AML(databases) patients. Bone marrow histology and reclassification as SM-AML has important clinical implications regarding prognosis and potential inclusion of KIT inhibitors in treatment concepts.","['Jawhar, Mohamad',

However, its potential function in leukemia is unknown. In murine models of chronic (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induced by BCR-ABL1 and MLL-AF9, respectively, knockdown of Fubp1 resulted in prolonged survival, decreased numbers of CML progenitor cells, decreased cell cycle activity and increased apoptosis. Knockdown of FUBP1 in CML and AML cell lines recapitulated these findings and revealed enhanced DNA damage compared to leukemia cells expressing wild type FUBP1 levels. FUBP1 was more highly expressed in human CML compared to normal bone marrow cells and its expression correlated with disease progression. In AML, higher FUBP1 expression in patient leukemia cells was observed with a trend toward correlation with shorter overall survival. Treatment of mice with AML with irinotecan, known to inhibit topoisomerase I and FUBP1, significantly prolonged survival alone or in combination with cytarabine. In summary, our data suggest that FUBP1 acts as cell cycle regulator and apoptosis inhibitor in leukemia. We demonstrated that FUBP1 might play a role in DNA repair, and its inhibition may improve outcome in leukemia patients.","['Hoang, Van T', 'Verma, Divij', 'Godavarthy, Parimala Sonika', 'Llavona, Pablo', 'Steiner, Marlene', 'Gerlach, Katharina', 'Michels, Birgitta E', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Wachter, Astrid', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Muller-Kuller, Uta', 'Weissenberger, Eva', 'Voutsinas, Jenna M', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Farin, Henner F', 'Zornig, Martin', 'Krause, Daniela S']","['Hoang VT', 'Verma D', 'Godavarthy PS', 'Llavona P', 'Steiner M', 'Gerlach K', 'Michels BE', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Wachter A', 'Oellerich T', 'Muller-Kuller U', 'Weissenberger E', 'Voutsinas JM', 'Oehler VG', 'Farin HF', 'Zornig M', 'Krause DS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-9450'],"['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Institute of Pathology, Georg-August-Universitat, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Department of Medical Statistics, Georg-August-Universitat, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt, Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Division of Hematology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.

Small molecule splicing modulators have been introduced into clinical trials to treat solid tumors or leukemia bearing recurrent spliceosome mutations. Nevertheless, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms that may enlighten therapeutic strategies for splicing modulators is highly desired. Here, using unbiased functional approaches, we report that the sensitivity to splicing modulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family genes is a key mechanism underlying preferential cytotoxicity induced by the SF3b-targeting splicing modulator E7107. While BCL2A1, BCL2L2 and MCL1 are prone to splicing perturbation, BCL2L1 exhibits resistance to E7107-induced splicing modulation. Consequently, E7107 selectively induces apoptosis in BCL2A1-dependent melanoma cells and MCL1-dependent NSCLC cells. Furthermore, combination of BCLxL (BCL2L1-encoded) inhibitors and E7107 remarkably enhances cytotoxicity in cancer cells. These findings inform mechanism-based approaches to the future clinical development of splicing modulators in cancer treatment.","['Aird, Daniel', 'Teng, Teng', 'Huang, Chia-Ling', 'Pazolli, Ermira', 'Banka, Deepti', 'Cheung-Ong, Kahlin', 'Eifert, Cheryl', 'Furman, Craig', 'Wu, Zhenhua Jeremy', 'Seiler, Michael', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Fekkes, Peter', 'Karr, Craig', 'Palacino, James', 'Park, Eunice', 'Smith, Peter G', 'Yu, Lihua', 'Mizui, Yoshiharu', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Chicas, Agustin', 'Corson, Laura', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Aird D', 'Teng T', 'Huang CL', 'Pazolli E', 'Banka D', 'Cheung-Ong K', 'Eifert C', 'Furman C', 'Wu ZJ', 'Seiler M', 'Buonamici S', 'Fekkes P', 'Karr C', 'Palacino J', 'Park E', 'Smith PG', 'Yu L', 'Mizui Y', 'Warmuth M', 'Chicas A', 'Corson L', 'Zhu P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4590-7290'],"['H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA. ping_zhu@h3biomedicine.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (E 7107)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing/*drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spliceosomes/drug effects/genetics', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",PMC6329755,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-08150-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-08150-5 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Jan 11;10(1):137. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-08150-5.,,,,,,,,20190111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that ""non-mutated"" splicing regulators may also play a role in AML biology and therefore conducted an in vivo shRNA screen in a mouse model of CEBPA mutant AML. This has led to the identification of the splicing regulator RBM25 as a novel tumor suppressor. In multiple human leukemic cell lines, knockdown of RBM25 promotes proliferation and decreases apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that RBM25 controls the splicing of key genes, including those encoding the apoptotic regulator BCL-X and the MYC inhibitor BIN1. This mechanism is also operative in human AML patients where low RBM25 levels are associated with high MYC activity and poor outcome. Thus, we demonstrate that RBM25 acts as a regulator of MYC activity and sensitizes cells to increased MYC levels.","['Ge, Ying', 'Schuster, Mikkel Bruhn', 'Pundhir, Sachin', 'Rapin, Nicolas', 'Bagger,

A total of 133 mutations were identified in the following genes in descending order: NOTCH1 (66.7%), FBXW7 (19.6%), PHF6 (15.7%), RUNX1 (12.7%), NRAS (10.8%), and DNMT3A (9.8%). Copy number alterations were most frequently detected in CDKN2B, CDKN2A, and genes on 9p21.3 in T-ALL (45.1%). Gene expression data demonstrated the downregulation of CDKN2B in most cases of T-ALL, whereas CDKN2A downregulation was mainly restricted to deletions. Additional quantitative methylation analysis demonstrated that CDKN2B downregulation stemmed from deletion and hypermethylation. Analysis of 64 patients with CDKN2B hypermethylation indicated an association with an older age of onset and early T cell precursor ALL, which involved very early arrest of T cell differentiation. Genes associated with methylation and myeloid neoplasms, including DNMT3A and NRAS, were more commonly mutated in T-ALL with CDKN2B hypermethylation. In particular, a CDKN2B biallelic deletion or high methylation level (>/=45%), the age of onset, and the GATA3 and SH2B3 mutations were factors associated with a poor prognosis.

CD4 T cells differentiate into distinct Th effector or regulatory subsets in response to signals delivered to them during the course of infection. Ikaros is a transcription factor that is expressed in blood cells from the level of the hematopoietic stem cell. It is required for normal thymic T cell development and serves as a tumor suppressor, as lack of Ikaros in developing lymphoid cells results in leukemia. To study the role of Ikaros in CD4 T cell differentiation and function, an Ikaros conditional knockout mouse was developed such that Ikaros expression was deleted specifically in mature T cells, thus avoiding defects observed in germline Ikaros mutant mice. Using this model system, we have shown that in the absence of Ikaros, CD4 T cells are able to attain Th1, Th2, and Th17, but not inducible regulatory T, cell fates. However, they show enhanced expression of a cohort of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in differentiation of Th17 cells with a phenotype that has been associated with autoimmunity and pathological inflammation. In addition, we define Ikaros as a repressor of the gene program associated with the response to type I IFNs, another key pathway whose deregulation is linked to autoimmunity. Taken together, these data definitively define Ikaros as a critical regulator at the center of the inflammatory response in T cells and highlight a potential role in suppressing autoimmunity.","['Lyon de Ana, Carolina', 'Arakcheeva, Ksenia', 'Agnihotri, Parul', 'Derosia, Nicole', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Lyon de Ana C', 'Arakcheeva K', 'Agnihotri P', 'Derosia N', 'Winandy S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2964-1624', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7804-9603']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Training Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118 swinandy@bu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R03 AI133228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI113522/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007309/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Inflammation/genetics/*immunology', 'Interferon Type I/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation']",PMC6365004,['NIHMS1516828'],2019/01/13 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801270 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801270 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Feb 15;202(4):1112-1123. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801270.

Though CLL has been associated with various types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer (PC), no data exist about the relationship between PC and MBL. We studied the frequency of CLL-like MBL clones in a group of 48 patients affected by PC and followed them during and after whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) treatment. We found four MBL clones (8.3%), two of which (4.2%) had a B-cell clonal count >1000 cells/microL ('clinical MBL'). A single case (1.8%) of 'low-count' MBL occurred in a control group of 54 healthy males. Notably, normal B-lymphocytes were consistently affected by WPRT, while MBL clones were less radiosensitive. Our results suggest a possible association between 'clinical' MBL and PC and show a different impact of the radiation on monoclonal respect to normal B-cells, which could also imply a greater risk of clonal transformation.","[""D'Auria, Fiorella"", 'Valvano, Luciana', 'Rago, Luciana', 'Statuto, Teodora', 'Calice, Giovanni', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Fusco, Vincenzo', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","[""D'Auria F"", 'Valvano L', 'Rago L', 'Statuto T', 'Calice G', ""D'Arena G"", 'Fusco V', 'Musto P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3807-7287'],"['Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Radiotherapy Service, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem cell Transplantation Unit, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Radiotherapy Service, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem cell Transplantation Unit, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/*complications/*radiotherapy']",,,2019/01/13 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jim-2018-000902 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2018-000902 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2019 Apr;67(4):779-782. doi: 10.1136/jim-2018-000902.

The objective was to evaluate whether protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a role in pediatric ALL and to determine the possible mechanism of epigenetic regulation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used bone marrow samples from patients with pediatric ALL, the Nalm6 cell line, mature B-cell lines, and mouse xenograft models to evaluate the function of PRMT5 in ALL tumorigenesis. RESULTS: This study showed that PRMT5 and the symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 (H4R3sme2) were upregulated in most initially diagnosed (n = 15; 100%) and relapsed (n = 4; 75%) bone marrow leukemia cells from patients with pediatric B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) and were decreased when the disease was in remission (n = 15; 6.7%). Downregulation of H4R3sme2 by PRMT5 silencing induced BCP-ALL cell differentiation from the pre-B to immature B stage, whereas overexpressed PRMT5 with enhanced H4R3sme2 promoted human mature B cells to dedifferentiate back to the pre-B II/immature B stages in vitro. High PRMT5 expression enhanced the proportion of CD43(+)/B220(+)/sIgM(-) B leukocytes in recipient mice. CLC and CTSB were identified as potential target genes of PRMT5 in BCP-ALL cells and were inhibited by H4R3sme2 in gene promoters. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that enhanced PRMT5 promotes BCP-ALL leukemogenesis partially by the dysregulation of B-cell lineage differentiation. H4R3sme2 and PRMT5 may serve as potential sensitive biomarkers of pediatric BCP-ALL. Suppression of the activation of PRMT5 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against pediatric BCP-ALL.","['Mei, Mei', 'Zhang, Ruidong', 'Zhou, Zhong-Wei', 'Ying, Zhengzhou', 'Wang, Jincheng', 'Zhang, Han', 'Zheng, Huyong', 'Bao, Shilai']","['Mei M', 'Zhang R', 'Zhou ZW', 'Ying Z', 'Wang J', 'Zhang H', 'Zheng H', 'Bao S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2684-512X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2684-512X']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University); Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; Department of Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", 'School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University); Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; Department of Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University); Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; Department of Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China. slbao@genetics.ac.cn zhenghuyong@vip.sina.com."", 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. slbao@genetics.ac.cn zhenghuyong@vip.sina.com.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*metabolism']",,,2019/01/13 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-2342 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2342 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 15;25(8):2633-2643. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2342.

Dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway frequently occurs in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Preclinical studies and early-phase trials have shown promise for MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibition in AML. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the MEK 1/2 inhibitor binimetinib in advanced myeloid malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with R/R AML and MDS, who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy or with disease resistance or intolerance to standard treatment were enrolled in the present phase II study of binimetinib dosed twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 64 years (range, 31-85 years). These patients had received a median of 3 previous lines of therapy (range, 1-6). The median bone marrow blast percentage was 49% (range, 2%-94%), and 14 patients had RAS mutations. The patients received a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-4 cycles) of binimetinib and received treatment for a median duration of 1.2 months (range, 0.1-3.4 months). Sixteen patients (84%) received the 45-mg twice daily dose. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hypokalemia (6%), hypotension (6%), lung infection (6%), and febrile neutropenia (6%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. One of the 13 evaluable patients (8%) achieved a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery lasting 2.1 months. The other 12 patients (92%) did not have a response. Six patients could not be evaluated. CONCLUSION: Binimetinib had tolerable safety profile with a minimal response in RAS-mutant AML. Future studies should focus on better patient selection and synergistic combination therapies involving MEK inhibition.","['Maiti, Abhishek', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Patel, Ami', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Maiti A', 'Naqvi K', 'Kadia TM', 'Borthakur G', 'Takahashi K', 'Bose P', 'Daver NG', 'Patel A', 'Alvarado Y', 'Ohanian M', 'DiNardo CD', 'Cortes JE', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ravandi F']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

The AML cell population is organized in a hierarchy that is reflected in the in vitro growth characteristics, with only a minority of cells being able to proliferate for more than two weeks. In this study, we investigated the ability of AML stem cells to survive and proliferate in suspension cultures in the presence of exogenous mediators but without supporting non-leukemic cells. We saw that a high number of maintained stem cells (i.e., a large number of clonogenic cells after five weeks of culture) was associated with decreased overall survival for patients receiving intensive chemotherapy; this prognostic impact was also detected in the multivariate/adjusted analysis. Furthermore, the patients with many clonogenic cells presented more frequently with mutations in transcription-related genes, and also showed a higher abundance of proteins involved in transcription at the time of diagnosis. In conclusion, the growth characteristics of the long-term proliferating leukemic stem cells seem to have an independent prognostic impact in human AML, and these characteristics appear to be reflected by the mutational landscape and the proteome of the patients at the time of diagnosis.","['Brenner, Annette K', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Berven, Frode', 'Gronningsaeter, Ida-Sofie', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Aasebo E', 'Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Selheim F', 'Berven F', 'Gronningsaeter IS', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Bruserud O']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059'],"['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital; 5021 Bergen, Norwa. annette.brenner@uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. annette.brenner@uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. elise.aasebo@uib.no.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. elise.aasebo@uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. maria.hernandez-valladares@uib.no.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. maria.hernandez-valladares@uib.no.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. frode.selheim@uib.no.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. frode.berven@uib.no.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital; 5021 Bergen, Norwa. ida.gronningseter@uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. ida.gronningseter@uib.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. sushma.bartaula@uib.no.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital; 5021 Bergen, Norwa. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.']",['eng'],"['911788/Helse Vest', '17813/Kreftforeningen', '62370/Kreftforeningen', '145008/Kreftforeningen', '15752/Kreftforeningen', '145007/Kreftforeningen']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6356272,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/01/13 06:01,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11010073 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11010073 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Jan 10;11(1). pii: cancers11010073. doi: 10.3390/cancers11010073.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonogenic cells', 'colony formation', 'cytokines', 'differentiation', 'transcription']",,,20190110,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is of fundamental importance to study the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of these materials as well as how they interact with the immune system. The present study was conducted to assess the immunotoxicity of graphene oxide (GO) and vanillin-functionalized GO (V-rGO) on THP-1 cells, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. The synthesized GO and V-rGO were characterized by using various analytical techniques. Various concentrations of GO and V-rGO showed toxic effects on THP-1 cells such as the loss of cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity was further demonstrated as an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased level of ATP content, and cell death. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation caused redox imbalance in THP-1 cells, leading to increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased levels of anti-oxidants such as glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), super oxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Increased generation of ROS and reduced MMP with simultaneous increases in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes suggest that the mitochondria-mediated pathway is involved in GO and V-rGO-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced consistently with the significant DNA damage caused by increased levels of 8-oxo-dG and upregulation of various key DNA-regulating genes in THP-1 cells, indicating that GO and V-rGO induce cell death through oxidative stress. As a result of these events, GO and V-rGO stimulated the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, indicating that the graphene materials induced potent inflammatory responses to THP-1 cells. The harshness of V-rGO in all assays tested occurred because of better charge transfer, various carbon to oxygen ratios, and chemical compositions in the rGO. Overall, these findings suggest that it is essential to better understand the parameters governing GO and functionalized GO in immunotoxicity and inflammation. Rational design of safe GO-based formulations for various applications, including nanomedicine, may result in the development of risk management methods for people exposed to graphene and graphene family materials, as these nanoparticles can be used as delivery agents in various biomedical applications.","['Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi', 'Kang, Min-Hee', 'Jeyaraj, Muniyandi', 'Kim, Jin-Hoi']","['Gurunathan S', 'Kang MH', 'Jeyaraj M', 'Kim JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9924-8433', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4402-7064', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1232-5307']","['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea. gsangiliyandi@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea. pocachippo@gmail.com.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea. muniyandij@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea. jhkim541@konkuk.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', 'CHI530446X (vanillin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Benzaldehydes/chemistry', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', '*Graphite/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', '*Oxides/chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC6359521,,2019/01/13 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2019/01/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20020247 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20020247 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 10;20(2). pii: ijms20020247. doi: 10.3390/ijms20020247.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cytokines', 'graphene', 'human acute monocytic leukemia cell', 'immunotoxicity', 'mitochondria', 'oxidative stress']",,,20190110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASNase's anticancer activity results from the enzymatic depletion of asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln), which are converted to aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu), respectively, in the blood. Unfortunately, accurate assessment of the in vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) of ASNase is challenging because of the following reasons: (i) ASNase is resilient to deactivation; (ii) ASNase catalytic efficiency is very high; and (iii) the PD markers Asn and Gln are depleted ex vivo in blood samples containing ASNase. To address those issues and facilitate longitudinal studies in individual mice for ASNase PD studies, we present here a new LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method that incorporates rapid quenching of ASNase for measurement of Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu in just 10 microL of whole blood, with limits of detection (s:n >/= 10:1) estimated to be 2.3, 3.5, 0.8, and 0.5 microM, respectively. We tested the suitability of the method in a 5-day, longitudinal PD study in mice and found the method to be simple to perform with sufficient accuracy and precision for whole blood measurements. Overall, the method increases the density of data that can be acquired from a single animal and will facilitate optimization of novel ASNase treatment regimens and/or the development of new ASNase variants with desired kinetic properties.","['Horvath, Thomas D', 'Chan, Wai Kin', 'Pontikos, Michael A', 'Martin, Leona A', 'Du, Di', 'Tan, Lin', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Weinstein, John N', 'Lorenzi, Philip L']","['Horvath TD', 'Chan WK', 'Pontikos MA', 'Martin LA', 'Du D', 'Tan L', 'Konopleva M', 'Weinstein JN', 'Lorenzi PL']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0385-7774'],"['Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. thomasdhorvath@gmail.com.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wkchan@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mapontikos@gmail.com.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. lamartin1@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. dudthu06@gmail.com.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ltan@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mkonople@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mkonople@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jweinste@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

METHODS: K562/A02 cells were cultured and collected in the logarithmic phase. K562/A02 stem cells were screened using immunomagnetic beads for reserve. K562/A02 LSC was injected to 5 of 40 BABL/c nude mice for preparing subcutaneous tumor. The rest 35 nude mice were then randomly divided into 7 groups, i.e., the normal control group, the model group, the Adriamycin (ADM) group, the PESV group, the ADM +high dose PESV group, the ADM + middle dose PESV group, the ADM +low dose PESV group, 5 in each group. Tumor tissue was embedded in all groups except the normal control group. One milliliter normal saline was peritoneally injected to mice in the model group after modeling, once per day. ADM 0. 05 mg was peritoneally injected to mice in the ADM group, once per other day. PESV 2 mug was peritoneally injected to mice in the PESV group, once per day. Mice in 3 ADM + PESV groups were peritoneally injected with ADM 0. 05 mg (once per other day) plus PESV (5, 2, and 1 mug respectively, once per day). All medication lasted for 14 days. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was detected using flow cytometry. Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and mRNA expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) were measured using RT-PCR. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) was detected using immunohistochemistry. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was detected using Western blot. NF-kappaB content was detected using ELISA. RESULTS: CD34 + CD38-ratio was 31.5% and IC(5)(0) was (60.33 +/- 10. 68) mug/mL before K562/A02 cells were screened with immunomagnetic beads, while they were 92. 8% and (58. 33 +/-9. 72) mug/mL after screen. The tumor formation rate was 100% in modeling mice. Compared with the model group, no statistical difference of each index occurred in the ADM group (P <0. 05). There was statistical difference in BCRP, MDR1 mRNA, or NF-kappaB factor between the model group and the PESV group (P <0. 05). The expression level of P-gp obviously decreased and the protein expression of P13K was down-regulated in 3 ADM + PESV groups (P <0. 05); mRNA expression of BCRP decreased and mRNA ex- pression of MDR1 obviously increased in the ADM + high dose PESV group and the ADM + middle dose PESV group, with statistical difference (P <0. 05). Protein expression of P13K was down-regulated in the ADM+ high dose PESV group, with statistical difference (P <0. 05). P-gp value, BCRP mRNA expression, MDR1 mRNA expression, PI3K, and NF-kappaB factor were all obviously down-regulated in the ADM +high dose PESV group, as compared with the ADM group and the PESV group respectively (P <0. 05). There was no statistical difference in ALDH1 positive rate among all groups (P >0. 05).

METHODS: We reviewed the courses of 409 newly diagnosed ALL patients from January 2004 to December 2013 in the Yeungnam region. RESULTS: All patients were classified into three risk groups: standard risk (SR, n=212), high risk (HR, n=153) and very high risk (VHR, n=44). The mean follow-up time was 73.6 +/- 39.4 months. The 7-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 78.7 +/- 2.1% and 86.8 +/- 1.8%, respectively. Significant 7-year EFS and OS rates for SR (84.0 +/- 2.7%, 93.7 +/- 1.8%), HR (76.5 +/- 3.5%, 82.1 +/- 3.3%), and VHR (60.6 +/- 7.5%, 69.9 +/- 7.5%) were observed (P<0.001), respectively. Relapse occurred in 52 patients, and the cumulative 7-year incidence of relapse differed according to risk groups (SR vs. HR vs. VHR=12.6% vs. 14.0% vs. 29.6%, P=0.003).For the 46 relapsed patients who were treated, the 3-year EFS and OS were 42.3 +/- 8.3%and 46.4+/- 8.4%. Among the 44 VHR patients, EFS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy-treated patients and those received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (P=0.533). The 7-year EFS of the hyperleukocytosis subgroup (24 cases, 14 under 10 years of age)showed a tendency for better prognosis than that of the other VHR subgroups (P=0.178).

Thus, identification of strategies to overcome insensitivity to apoptosis and growth inhibition is a growing focus of research in this malignancy. This study evaluated the potential anti-cancer effects of an ethanol extract from the Actinidia arguta (Hardy Kiwi) root (RAE) on CCA. Our data demonstrated that RAE decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis by activation of Caspase 3, Caspase 8, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in two CCA cell lines. RAE induced a decrease in Mcl-1 in cultured CCA cells and in xenograft CCA tumors. Administration of RAE every other day led to significant growth inhibition in tumor burden xenograft CCA mice. Western blotting analysis of paired human CCA and normal adjacent tissues from the same patient revealed that CCA tissues exhibited significantly higher Mcl-1 expression than normal tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the anti-cancer effects of RAE on CCA both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that RAE may be a promising anti-CCA agent and could be beneficial in the treatment of CCA through the targeting of Mcl-1.","['Zhao, Xiangxuan', 'Wen, Feng', 'Wang, Wei', 'Lu, Zaiming', 'Guo, Qiyong']","['Zhao X', 'Wen F', 'Wang W', 'Lu Z', 'Guo Q']",,"['a Department of Radiology , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang , China.', 'a Department of Radiology , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang , China.', 'a Department of Radiology , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang , China.', 'a Department of Radiology , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang , China.', 'a Department of Radiology , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Actinidia/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2018.1557218 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2019;71(2):246-256. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1557218.

It is known to cause several diseases like adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Serology and molecular methods have been used to detect this virus. Of these, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used as a primary screening method and this is usually followed by western blotting (WB) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods as confirmatory tests. We conducted a systematic review of the different techniques used in the diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search was limited to original papers in the English language from 2010 to 2018 using several databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Iranmedex, and Scientific Information Database. A manual search of references provided in the included papers was also performed. RESULTS: Of 101 electronically searched citations, 43 met the inclusion criteria. ELISA is commonly used for qualitative and screening detection, and WB and PCR techniques are used to confirm infection. CONCLUSION: Among all the reported methods for detection of HTLV-1, only serological and molecular tests are used as the most common technical assays for HTLV-1. The ELISA assay, without a confirmatory test, has several limitations and affect the accuracy of the results. Owing to the prevalence of HTLV-1 and limitations of the current detection methods, further evaluation of the accuracy of these methods is needed. There are new opportunities for applying novel technological advances in microfluidics, biosensors, and lab-on-a-chip systems to perform HTLV-1 diagnostics.","['Fani, Mona', 'Rezayi, Majid', 'Meshkat, Zahra', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim', 'Makvandi, Manoochehr', 'Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim', 'Ferns, Gordon A']","['Fani M', 'Rezayi M', 'Meshkat Z', 'Rezaee SA', 'Makvandi M', 'Abouzari-Lotf E', 'Ferns GA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1024-3906', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5602-6961', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0549-4199', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0957-8349']","['Virology Department, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Antimicrobial Resistance Research Center, Department of Medical Bacteriology and Virology, Qaem University Hospital, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Disease Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Virology Department, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Advanced Materials Research Group, Center of Hydrogen Energy, Institute of Future Energy, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', 'Division of Medical Education, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Falmer, Brighton, Sussex, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,IM,"['Biosensing Techniques/methods', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology/virology', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*diagnosis/pathology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/05/22 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28087 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):12433-12441. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28087.

Despite significant improvement in the pathologic insight into this group of disorders, therapeutic options remain limited and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the only treatment that can induce long-term remission in patients with MDS. The goals of therapy for MDS are based on disease prognostication, with a focus of minimizing transfusion dependence and preserving quality of life in low-risk groups and preventing progression of disease to acute myeloid leukemia in high-risk groups. Given the dearth of approved treatment options, there is a marked need for novel therapies across the board, and there are several novel agents currently in the pipeline. RECENT FINDINGS: Among the promising agents with preclinical and early phase efficacy in higher risk MDS, apoptosis targeting with BCL-2 inhibitors have been a standout. There is also a keen interest in immunotherapy, and targeted agents (genetic, signaling pathways, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and others described in this review). SUMMARY: In this review, we will highlight some of the promising new agents currently under investigation for the management of MDS.","['Chandhok, Namrata S', 'Boddu, Prajwal C', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Prebet, Thomas']","['Chandhok NS', 'Boddu PC', 'Gore SD', 'Prebet T']",,"['Smilow Cancer Center at Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000483 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):77-87. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen patients were on imatinib; 9 ceased their TKI prior to conception and 7 ceased at pregnancy confirmation. Twelve patients had achieved either MMR or better at time of TKI cessation. Eleven women lost MMR during pregnancy and two patients lost CHR. Fourteen women reestablished MMR on TKI recommenced. The depth molecular response prior to conception appeared to correlate well with restoration of disease control on TKI recommencement though duration of MMR did not appear to be as important. While interruption of TKI treatment for pregnancy usually leads to loss of molecular response, loss of hematological response is uncommon and disease control is reestablished with resumption of therapy in the majority of women.","['Lasica, Masa', 'Willcox, Abbey', 'Burbury, Kate', 'Ross, David M', 'Branford, Susan', 'Butler, Jason', 'Filshie, Robin', 'Januszewicz, Henry', 'Joske, David', 'Mills, Anthony', 'Simpson, David', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Taylor, Kerry', 'Watson, Anne-Marie', 'Wolf, Max', 'Grigg, Andrew']","['Lasica M', 'Willcox A', 'Burbury K', 'Ross DM', 'Branford S', 'Butler J', 'Filshie R', 'Januszewicz H', 'Joske D', 'Mills A', 'Simpson D', 'Tam C', 'Taylor K', 'Watson AM', 'Wolf M', 'Grigg A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9343-542X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7171-2935']","['a Department of Clinical Hematology , Austin Hospital , Heidelberg , Australia.', 'a Department of Clinical Hematology , Austin Hospital , Heidelberg , Australia.', 'b Australian Centre for Blood Disease , Monash University , Melbourne , Australia.', 'c Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , East Melbourne , Australia.', 'd Bedford Park , Flinders University and Medical Centre , Adelaide Australia.', 'e Centre for Cancer Biology, an alliance between SA Pathology and University of South Australia , Adelaide , Australia.', ""f Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital , Brisbane , Australia."", ""g St Vincent's Hospital , Fitzroy , Australia."", 'c Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , East Melbourne , Australia.', 'h Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital , Nedlands , Australia.', 'i Ramsay Specialist Centre, Greenslopes Private Hospital , Greenslopes , Australia.', 'j North Shore Hospital, Waitemata District Health Board , Auckland , New Zealand.', 'c Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , East Melbourne , Australia.', 'k Icon Cancer Care, Mater Medical Centre , South Brisbane , Australia.', 'l Liverpool Hospital , Liverpool , Australia.', 'c Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , East Melbourne , Australia.', 'a Department of Clinical Hematology , Austin Hospital , Heidelberg , Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1551533 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jul;60(7):1796-1802. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1551533.

We conducted a single-institution, phase 2, investigator-initiated trial of ruxolitinib plus pracinostat (begun after 12 weeks of ruxolitinib) in 25 patients with myelofibrosis, of whom 20 received both agents. Sixteen (80%) patients had objective responses (all 'clinical improvement'). The rate of spleen response (by palpation) was 74%, and that of symptom response 80%. Most responses occurred prior to pracinostat initiation. Three patients experienced improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and one a near-complete molecular response after two years on study treatment. All patients discontinued pracinostat and are currently off-study. Pracinostat interruptions and dose reductions were frequent, often due to worsening anemia.

Limited data exist on the impact of fatigue, QoL, and related symptoms in these patients. OBJECTIVE: Prospectively assess fatigue (functional assessment of cancer therapy-anemia [FACT-An]); QoL (FACT-An subscales); pain (brief pain inventory); and depression, anxiety, and stress (depression anxiety stress scale-21) and strategies used to manage these symptoms in patients with MDS, AA, and PNH. METHODS: Surveys were administered via the AA and MDS International Foundation website and database from October 2014 through April 2015 in a cross-sectional study. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 303 patients, 145 (48%) had MDS, 84 (28%) had AA, and 74 (24%) had PNH; 31 (10%) had >1 diagnosis. The mean age was 57 years, 200 (66%) were female, and 195 (92%) were white. The mean fatigue scores were 25 (range 1-52) for the whole cohort, 28 for AA, 25 for MDS, and 24 for PNH (P = 0.117); these are all considered severe level. The mean QoL score was 68 (range 10-104) for the whole cohort, 67 for AA, 69 for MDS, and 67 for PNH (P = 0.821). The ranges for stress were normal; pain and depression, mild; and anxiety, moderate. The most common management strategies perceived as helpful for fatigue in the past month were preserving energy, physical activity, and naps. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with MDS, AA, and PNH report severe fatigue. The helpfulness of fatigue management strategies may impact patients' continued use; whether these strategies are beneficial and decrease fatigue levels needs more study.","['Escalante, Carmen P', 'Chisolm, Stephanie', 'Song, Juhee', 'Richardson, Marsha', 'Salkeld, Ellen', 'Aoki, Etsuko', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Escalante CP', 'Chisolm S', 'Song J', 'Richardson M', 'Salkeld E', 'Aoki E', 'Garcia-Manero G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5465-8594'],"['Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications/rehabilitation', 'Anxiety/etiology', 'Depression/etiology', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue/*etiology/rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*complications/rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/rehabilitation', 'Pain/etiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Sleep', 'Young Adult']",PMC6382725,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1953 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Feb;8(2):543-553. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1953.

To test the effect of this interaction on macrophage inflammatory activation, the human macrophage-like monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was treated with oligomycin, rotenone, or sodium azide, which induce mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) by blocking the electron transport chain (ETC). MD induced by these agents triggered activation of various sensors and markers of ER stress. This linkage affected macrophage function since LPS-induced expression of IL-23 was enhanced by the MD inducers, and this enhancing effect was abolished by inhibition of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activity. This MD-mediated ER stress may be universal since it was observed in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and colon cancer SW480 cells. On the other hand, MD regulated LPS-induced activation of the AKT/GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway in a manner not affected by inhibition of PERK or inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) activities. These results indicate that the occurrence of MD can lead to ER stress and these two events, separately or in combination, can affect various cellular processes.","['Heo, Jae-Nyoung', 'Kim, Dong-Yeon', 'Lim, Su-Geun', 'Lee, Kiboo', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Lee, Won-Ha']","['Heo JN', 'Kim DY', 'Lim SG', 'Lee K', 'Suk K', 'Lee WH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-1367'],"['School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science & Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['2017R1D1A1B04028358/Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology']",['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-23/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.11103 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2019 Mar;43(3):313-322. doi: 10.1002/cbin.11103.

However, allogeneic T cell therapies must address HLA barriers and conventionally rely on the availability of a suitable HLA-matched donor if graft-vs-host-disease and rejection effects are to be avoided. More recently, the incorporation of additional genome editing manipulations, to disrupt T cell receptor expression and address other critical pathways have been explored. Clinical trials are underway investigating non-HLA matched T cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and anti-CD123 CAR for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Such approaches continue to be refined and improved to widen accessibility and reduce the cost of T cell therapies for a wider range of conditions.","['Qasim, Waseem']",['Qasim W'],['ORCID: 0000-0001-8353-4494'],"['University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['RP-2014-05-007/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'RP2014/National Institute for Health Research/International', 'Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25399 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 May;94(S1):S50-S54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25399.

Recent findings have improved understanding of the pathophysiology of myeloid malignancy-associated ND. We review the clinical spectrum of myeloid malignancy-associated ND with an emphasis on recently identified mechanisms. Myeloid leukemia cells retain the potential for terminal differentiation into polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the skin. Many studies suggest a clonal link between myeloid malignancies and ND.

While a number of recent advances have improved treatment, high cure rates have not yet been achieved. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is found mutated in nearly one-third of newly diagnosed cases and leads to NPM1 protein that is mislocalized to the cytoplasm instead of the nucleolus. If the mechanistic basis through which this mislocalization leads to malignancy could be revealed, this AML subtype may be targetable with new drugs. Here, we review the structure and functions of the normal and mutant forms of nucleophosmin. We discuss several recent studies that have shed light on the pathophysiology of NPM1 mutations. We discuss the importance of HOX gene misregulation in NPM1-mutated leukemias, as well as evidence for the reliance of mutated NPM1 on its continued nuclear export. Together, these aspects, as well as new tools to manipulate and study NPM1, open the door to new therapeutic strategies that may ultimately improve treatment of this common subtype of AML.","['Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Gundry, Michael C', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Brunetti L', 'Gundry MC', 'Goodell MA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1111-2932'],"['The Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."", 'Centro Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Universita degli Studi di Perugia, 06123, Perugia, Italy.', 'The Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."", 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. goodell@bcm.edu.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. goodell@bcm.edu."", 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. goodell@bcm.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. goodell@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA183252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK092883/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-02578-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-02578-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Aug;110(2):150-160. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-02578-7.

It has been reported that both types of cells are decreased in myeloproliferative neoplasms in patients and also in a mouse model, whereas an increase in NESCs was reported in acute myeloid leukemia. It is thus of interest whether and how these BM stromal cells are structured in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here, we focused on NESCs and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells in the BM of MDS patients. We found a marked increase of NESCs in MDS with fibrosis (MDS-F) at a high frequency (9/19; 47.4%), but not in MDS without fibrosis (0/26; 0%). Intriguingly, in eight of the nine (88.9%) MDS-F cases with elevated NESCs, a majority of NESCs also expressed GFAP, with an additional increase in GFAP single-positive cells. Furthermore, in seven of them, we found a prominent structure characterized by neurofilament heavy chain staining surrounded by NESCs with GFAP expression. This structure may represent peripheral nerve axons surrounded by Schwann cells, and could be relevant to the pathophysiology of MDS-F.","['Cao-Sy, Luan', 'Obara, Naoshi', 'Sakamoto, Tatsuhiro', 'Kato, Takayasu', 'Hattori, Keiichiro', 'Sakashita, Shingo', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Nishikii, Hidekazu', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Cao-Sy L', 'Obara N', 'Sakamoto T', 'Kato T', 'Hattori K', 'Sakashita S', 'Nannya Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Harada H', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Nishikii H', 'Chiba S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-7338'],"['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Cytogenetics, Blood Transfusion Hematology Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. schiba-tky@umin.net.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. schiba-tky@umin.net.', 'TARA Center, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. schiba-tky@umin.net.']",['eng'],"['15K15359/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '17K09898/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '18cm0106505h/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development']",['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (GFAP protein, human)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nestin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nestin/*biosynthesis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Schwann Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-02576-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-02576-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Mar;109(3):309-318. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-02576-9.

When cultivated together, AT-MSCs showed cellular cytotoxicity and were therefore killed by NK cells in an activating-cytokine dependent manner. In the presence of AT-MSCs, both ligands and receptors known to drive NK cell interactions were significantly altered. During this co-culture, the proliferation of NK cells was slightly reduced, while their IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion was significantly increased. NK cells displayed sustained degranulation accompanied by increased discharge of their cytolytic granules (perforin, granzymes A and B). On the other hand, activated NK cells reduced the expression of serpins C1 and B9 in AT-MSCs. Collectively, reciprocal immuno-biological alterations occur during the co-culture of NK cells and AT-MSCs. Understanding these changes will increase the safety and efficacy of cell-based immuno-oncotherapy.","['Najar, Mehdi', 'Fayyad-Kazan, Mohammad', 'Merimi, Makram', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Najar M', 'Fayyad-Kazan M', 'Merimi M', 'Meuleman N', 'Bron D', 'Fayyad-Kazan H', 'Lagneaux L']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Osteoarthritis Research Unit, University of Montreal Hospital Research Center (CRCHUM), 900 Saint-Denis, R11.424, Montreal, QC, H2X 0A9, Canada.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 121 Boulevard de Waterloo, 1000, Brussels, Belgium. mfayyadk@ulb.ac.be.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 121 Boulevard de Waterloo, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Physiology, Genetics and Ethnopharmacology, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohammed Premier, Oujda, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 121 Boulevard de Waterloo, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 121 Boulevard de Waterloo, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Sciences I, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,PMC6368507,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/01/12 06:01,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:01 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10616-019-00294-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10616-019-00294-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2019 Feb;71(1):375-388. doi: 10.1007/s10616-019-00294-6.

We describe a case of AMoL with morphology resembling either plasma blasts or very immature erythroblasts. Diagnosis was made by alpha-naphtyl-acetate esterase staining and with immunophenotyping, which was made with a wide monoclonal antibody panel. Blasts were positive for monocytic markers. Most of leukemic cells, however, were positive for Glycophorin-A. The presence of Glycophorin-A, which is considered as a specific marker of the erythroid lineage, has never been reported previously in cases of AMoL.

This theory is based on the observation of the increased frequency of malignancies in primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, and is supported by the successful demonstration of immune augmentation in current oncological immune therapy approaches. We review this model in the context of Down syndrome (DS), a condition with a unique tumor profile and various immune defects. Children and adults with DS are more prone to infections due to anatomical reasons and a varying degree of T- and B-cell maturation defects, NK cell dysfunction, and chemotactic or phagocytic abnormalities. However, despite an increased incidence of lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia of infants and children with DS, individuals with DS have a globally decreased incidence of solid tumors as compared to age-adjusted non-DS controls. Additionally, cancers that have been considered ""proof of immune therapy principles,"" such as renal carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and malignant melanoma, are less frequent in adults with DS compared to the general population. Thus, despite the combination of an increased risk of leukemia with detectable immune biological abnormalities and a clinical immunodeficiency, people with DS appear to be protected against many cancers. This observation does not support the immune surveillance theory in the context of DS and indicates a potential tumor-suppressive role for trisomy 21 in non-hematological malignancies.","['Satge, Daniel', 'Seidel, Markus G']","['Satge D', 'Seidel MG']",,"['Laboratoire Biostatistiques Epidemiologie Sante Publique, Team Cancer (EA 2415), and Oncodefi, Institut Universitaire de Recherche Clinique, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut Universitaire de Recherche Clinique, Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health EA2415, Montpellier, France.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University Hospital, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chemotaxis/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility/*immunology', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC6315194,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03058 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 19;9:3058. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03058. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*cancer incidence', '*cancer protection', '*down syndrome', '*immune defect', '*immune surveillance', '*trisomy 21', '*tumor profile']",,,20181219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies based on ex vivo cultures of human luminal breast cancer tissues further argue that the contribution of stroma-derived signals to MCL-1 expression shapes BCL-2 dependency. Thus, MCL-1 inhibitors are beneficial for targeted apoptosis of breast tumor ecosystems, even in a subtype where MCL-1 dependency is not intrinsically driven by oncogenic pathways.","['Louault, K', 'Bonneaud, T L', 'Seveno, C', 'Gomez-Bougie, P', 'Nguyen, F', 'Gautier, F', 'Bourgeois, N', 'Loussouarn, D', 'Kerdraon, O', 'Barille-Nion, S', 'Jezequel, P', 'Campone, M', 'Amiot, M', 'Juin, P P', 'Souaze, F']","['Louault K', 'Bonneaud TL', 'Seveno C', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Nguyen F', 'Gautier F', 'Bourgeois N', 'Loussouarn D', 'Kerdraon O', 'Barille-Nion S', 'Jezequel P', 'Campone M', 'Amiot M', 'Juin PP', 'Souaze F']",,"[""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 10, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'ONIRIS, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine Food Science and Engineering, Animal Cancers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', 'ICO Rene Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', 'ICO Rene Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', 'ICO Rene Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', 'ICO Rene Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, France.', 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, Team 10, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France. philippe.juin@univ-nantes.fr."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France. philippe.juin@univ-nantes.fr.', 'ICO Rene Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, France. philippe.juin@univ-nantes.fr.', 'CNRS GDR3697 Micronit, Tours, France. philippe.juin@univ-nantes.fr.', ""CRCINA, Team 8, INSERM, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France. frederique.souaze@univ-nantes.fr."", 'SIRIC ILIAD, Angers, Nantes, France. frederique.souaze@univ-nantes.fr.', 'CNRS GDR3697 Micronit, Tours, France. frederique.souaze@univ-nantes.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*deficiency/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism']",PMC6756023,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0635-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0635-z [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Apr;38(17):3261-3273. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0635-z.

Although survival rate is usually high after the initial chemotherapy, many TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patients relapse and subsequently develop treatment resistance, resulting in poor prognosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular signaling associated with Wnt16b and ROR1 overexpression in TCF3-PBX1 cell lines and primary samples, and to identify effective treatment options via ROR1 targeting. We detected higher ROR1 expression on TCF3-PBX1 leukemic cells even at a later stage of patient relapse, providing a strong rationale for the use of ROR1-targeted therapy. We found that Wnt5a-ROR1 signaling enhances proliferation of TCF3-PBX1 cells via RhoA/Rac1 GTPases activation and STAT3 upregulation. Wnt16b also activated the RhoA/Rac1 signaling cascade suggesting the activation of a non-canonical Wnt pathway in TCF3-PBX1 cells. Wnt16 could interact with ROR1 but not in TCF3-PBX1 cells, suggesting that Wnt5a is the ligand signaling via ROR1 in TCF3-PBX1 cells. By high throughput drug-sensitivity testing of TCF3-PBX1 cells before and after ROR1 knockdown we found that targeting ROR1 significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors venetoclax and navitoclax, and this synergism was confirmed ex vivo using a drug-resistant primary sample from a relapsed TCF3-PBX1 patient.

We examined the role of MCPIP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1), a novel cytokine-induced antiinflammatory protein, in this process. Basal MCPIP1 expression was lower in rat vs. human islets and beta-cells. Proinflammatory cytokines stimulated MCPIP1 expression in rat and human islets and in insulin-secreting cells. Moderate overexpression of MCPIP1 protected insulin-secreting INS1E cells against cytokine toxicity by a mechanism dependent on the presence of the PIN/DUB domain in MCPIP1. It also reduced cytokine-induced Chop and C/ebpbeta expression and maintained MCL-1 expression. The shRNA-mediated suppression of MCPIP1 led to the potentiation of cytokine-mediated NFkappaB activation and cytokine toxicity in human EndoC-betaH1 beta-cells. MCPIP1 expression was very high in infiltrated beta-cells before and after diabetes manifestation in the LEW.1AR1-iddm rat model of human T1DM. The extremely high expression of MCPIP1 in clonal beta-cells was associated with a failure of the regulatory feedback-loop mechanism, ER stress induction and high cytokine toxicity. In conclusion, our data indicate that the expression level of MCPIP1 affects the susceptibility of insulin-secreting cells to cytokines and regulates the mechanism of beta-cell death in T1DM.","['Tyka, Karolina', 'Jorns, Anne', 'Turatsinze, Jean-Valery', 'Eizirik, Decio L', 'Lenzen, Sigurd', 'Gurgul-Convey, Ewa']","['Tyka K', 'Jorns A', 'Turatsinze JV', 'Eizirik DL', 'Lenzen S', 'Gurgul-Convey E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9269-266X'],"['Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Diabetes Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain amyloidosis (AH) involving the kidney is a rare condition and the pathology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and prognosis are becoming understood. This report is of a rare case of T-LGL associated with renal AH and discusses the approach to management. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman presented with symptoms of fatigue and she had proteinuria. A diagnosis of T-LGL associated with renal AH was made, which is an association that has not been previously reported in the literature. Given the dysregulation of her immune function due to her underlying T-LGL and her comorbidities, treatment options were limited. She was clinically stable and was initially observed. After one year, her symptoms of fatigue became worse, and her proteinuria increased. Treatment was initiated with the triple drug combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) with consideration for future hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Her clinical condition improved, with a reduction in proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS A rare case of T-LGL and renal AH is presented. Currently, there is no standard therapy for T-LGL and AH amyloidosis, and the approach, in this case, was to manage the patient initially with CyBorD triple chemotherapy.","['Fu, Julie', 'Lee, Lisa X', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Fogaren, Teresa', 'Varga, Cindy', 'Comenzo, Raymond L']","['Fu J', 'Lee LX', 'Zhou P', 'Fogaren T', 'Varga C', 'Comenzo RL']",,"['Division of Hematology Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Center in Stoneham, Tufts Medical Center, Stoneham, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'John C Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'John C Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'John C Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'John C Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Amyloidosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Kidney Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteinuria/etiology']",PMC6345110,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['912282 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.912282 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Jan 11;20:43-47. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.912282.,,,,,,,,20190111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, purifying them from within the bulk tumor has been challenging, so their precise genetic and functional characteristics are not well defined. The side population assay exploits the ability of some cells to efflux Hoechst dye via ATP-binding cassette transporters. Stem cells have increased expression of these transporters and this assay has been shown to enrich for stem cells in various tissues and cancers. This study identifies the side population within a zebrafish model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and correlates the frequency of side population cells with the frequency of leukemia stem cells (more precisely referred to as leukemia-propagating cells within our transplantation model). In addition, the side population within the leukemia evolves with serial transplantation, increasing in tandem with leukemia-propagating cell frequency over subsequent generations. Sorted side population cells from these tumors are enriched for leukemia-propagating cells and have enhanced engraftment compared to sorted non-side population cells when transplanted into syngeneic recipients. RNA-sequencing analysis of sorted side population cells compared to non-side population cells identified a shared expression profile within the side population and pathway analysis yielded Wnt-signaling as the most overrepresented. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell differentiation and canonical Wnt-signaling were significantly upregulated in the side population. Overall, these results demonstrate that the side population in zebrafish acute lymphoblastic leukemia significantly enriches for leukemia-propagating cells and identifies the Wnt pathway as a likely genetic driver of leukemia stem cell fate.","['Baeten, Jeremy T', 'Waarts, Michael R', 'Pruitt, Margaret M', 'Chan, Wen-Ching', 'Andrade, Jorge', 'de Jong, Jill L O']","['Baeten JT', 'Waarts MR', 'Pruitt MM', 'Chan WC', 'Andrade J', 'de Jong JLO']",,"['University of Chicago, Biological Sciences Division, Department of Pediatrics, Chicago.', 'University of Chicago, Biological Sciences Division, Department of Pediatrics, Chicago.', 'University of Chicago, Biological Sciences Division, Department of Pediatrics, Chicago.', 'University of Chicago, Center for Research Informatics, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'University of Chicago, Center for Research Informatics, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'University of Chicago, Biological Sciences Division, Department of Pediatrics, Chicago jdejong@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Side-Population Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Zebrafish']",PMC6601080,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.206417 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.206417 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jul;104(7):1388-1395. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.206417.

We previously reported that HLA class I/beta2 microglobulin and programmed death ligand-1 expression are prognostic factors in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A recent report suggested that HLA class II expression is also an important prognostic factor for the clinical outcome of programmed death-1 blockade therapy in recurrent/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. This prompted us to evaluate HLA class II expression in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and to compare the findings with the patients' clinicopathological features. Of the 132 biopsy specimens examined from newly diagnosed patients, lymphoma cells were positive for HLA class II expression in 44 patients (33.3%), whereas programmed death ligand-1 expression was observed on neoplastic cells from nine patients (6.9%) and on stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment in 83 cases (62.9%). HLA class II-positive cases showed a significantly better overall survival compared to the HLA class II-negative cases (P<0.0001). Patients positive for HLA class II and programmed death ligand-1 microenvironmental expression had significantly better prognosis than the other groups (P<0.0001). HLA class II-positive and HLA class II-negative groups also showed a significant difference in complete remission rate (P=0.0421), HLA class I/beta2 microglobulin expression (P=0.0165), and the number of programmed death-1-positive tumor infiltrating cells (P=0.0020). HLA class II expression was a prognostic factor for overall survival both in univariate and multivariate analyses (P<0.0001 and P=0.0007, respectively). Our study reveals that HLA class II is a novel prognostic factor in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['Takeuchi, Mai', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Asano, Naoko', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Yanagida, Eriko', 'Moritsubo, Mayuko', 'Nakata, Michiko', 'Umeno, Takeshi', 'Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Komaki, Satoru', 'Muta, Hiroko', 'Furuta, Takuya', 'Seto, Masao', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Takeuchi M', 'Miyoshi H', 'Asano N', 'Yoshida N', 'Yamada K', 'Yanagida E', 'Moritsubo M', 'Nakata M', 'Umeno T', 'Suzuki T', 'Komaki S', 'Muta H', 'Furuta T', 'Seto M', 'Ohshima K']",,"['Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics, Nagano Prefectural Shinshu Medical Center, Suzaka, Nagano.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka ohshima_kouichi@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",PMC6669171,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.205567 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.205567 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Aug;104(8):1626-1632. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.205567.

We studied 110 consecutively diagnosed and uniformly treated childhood B-other patients using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and whole exome/transcriptome sequencing. The frequency of DUX4-rearranged, BCR-ABL1-like, ZNF384-rearranged, ETV6-RUNX1-like, iAMP21 and MEF2D-rearranged subtypes was 27%, 15%, 5%, 5%, 4%, and 2%, respectively; 43% of cases were not classified into any of these subtypes (B-rest). We found worse early response to treatment in DUX4-rearranged leukemia and a strong association of ZNF384-rearranged leukemia with B-myeloid immunophenotype. Of the druggable lesions, JAK/STAT-class and RAS/RAF/MAPK-class aberrations were found in 21% and 43% of patients, respectively; an ABL-class aberration was found in one patient. A recently described negative prognostic factor, IKZF1(plus) , was found in 14% of patients and was enriched in (but not exclusive for) BCR-ABL1-like subtype. PAX5 fusions (including 4 novel), intragenic amplifications and P80R mutations were mutually exclusive and only occurred in the B-rest subset, altogether accounting for 20% of the B-other group. PAX5 P80R was associated with a specific gene expression signature, potentially defining a novel leukemia subtype. Our study shows unbiased European population-based frequencies of novel ALL subtypes, recurrent (cyto)genetic aberrations and their mutual associations. This study also strengthens and widens the current knowledge of B-other ALL and provides an objective basis for optimization of current genetic diagnostics.","['Zaliova, Marketa', 'Stuchly, Jan', 'Winkowska, Lucie', 'Musilova, Alena', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Slamova, Martina', 'Starkova, Julia', 'Vaskova, Martina', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Stary, Jan', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Trka, Jan']","['Zaliova M', 'Stuchly J', 'Winkowska L', 'Musilova A', 'Fiser K', 'Slamova M', 'Starkova J', 'Vaskova M', 'Hrusak O', 'Sramkova L', 'Stary J', 'Zuna J', 'Trka J']",,"['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague jan.trka@lfmotol.cuni.cz marketa.zaliova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague jan.trka@lfmotol.cuni.cz marketa.zaliova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Transcriptome']",PMC6601078,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.204974 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.204974 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jul;104(7):1396-1406. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.204974.

We analyzed the impact of different methods on ERG-deletion detection rate, evaluated ERG-deletion as a potential marker for DUX4-rearranged leukemia, studied its associations with molecular and clinical characteristics within this leukemia subtype, and analyzed its clonality. Using single-nucleotide-polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicon-sequencing we found ERG-deletion in 34% (16 of 47), 66% (33 of 50) and 78% (39 of 50) of DUX4-rearranged leukemia, respectively.

Within DUX4-rearranged leukemia, the ERG-deletion was associated with higher total number of copy-number aberrations, and, importantly, the ERG-deletion positivity by PCR was associated with better outcome [5-year event-free survival (EFS), ERG-deletion-positive 93% vs. ERG-deletion-negative 68%, P=0.022; 5-year overall survival (OS), ERG-deletion-positive 97% vs. ERG-deletion-negative 75%, P=0.029]. Ultra-deep amplicon-sequencing revealed distinct co-existing ERG-deletions in 22 of 24 patients. In conclusion, our data demonstrate inadequate sensitivity of single-nucleotide-polymorphism array for ERG-deletion detection, unacceptable for proper IKZF1 (plus) classification. Even using more sensitive methods (PCR/amplicon-sequencing) for its detection, ERG-deletion is absent in 22-34% of DUX4-rearranged leukemia and does not represent an adequately sensitive marker of this leukemia subtype. Importantly, the ERG-deletion potentially stratifies the DUX4-rearranged leukemia into biologically/clinically distinct subsets. Frequent polyclonal pattern of ERG-deletions shows that late origin of this lesion is more common than has been previously described.","['Zaliova, Marketa', 'Potuckova, Eliska', 'Hovorkova, Lenka', 'Musilova, Alena', 'Winkowska, Lucie', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Stuchly, Jan', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Starkova, Julia', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan']","['Zaliova M', 'Potuckova E', 'Hovorkova L', 'Musilova A', 'Winkowska L', 'Fiser K', 'Stuchly J', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Starkova J', 'Zuna J', 'Stary J', 'Trka J']",,"['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague marketa.zaliova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DUX4L1 protein, human)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/genetics']",PMC6601096,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.204487 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.204487 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jul;104(7):1407-1416. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.204487.

However, outcomes of prior studies have been disappointing in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms due to high incidences of progression or graft failure (together termed hematopoietic cell transplantation-failure). We hypothesized that escalating the total body irradiation dose may improve the outcomes and subsequently performed a phase II total body irradiation dose-escalation trial. Patients with median age 66 years were enrolled in two arms to receive non-myeloablative conditioning followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation with total body irradiation dose escalation for excessive hematopoietic cell transplantation-failure: Arm A: myeloproliferative neoplasm/myelodysplastic syndrome low risk (n=36); and Arm B: myelodysplastic syndrome high-risk/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=41). Total body irradiation dose levels were: Level-1 (300 cGy), Level-2 (400 cGy), or Level-3 (450 cGy). Patients received intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for three days. Total body irradiation was administered on day 0 followed by infusion of peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched related (n=30) or unrelated (n=47) donors. Post-grafting immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine was administered. The primary end point was day 200 hematopoietic cell transplant failure, with the objective of reducing the incidence to <20%. The primary end point was reached on Arm A at dose Level-1 (300 cGy total body irradiation) with a cumulative incidence of day 200 hematopoietic cell transplant failure of 11%, and on Arm B at dose Level-3 (450 cGy) with a cumulative incidence of day 200 hematopoietic cell transplant failure of 9%. Increasing the total body irradiation dose leads to a higher success rate with non-myeloablative conditioning by reducing relapse and rejection. Further studies are necessary to decrease non-relapse mortality, especially among patients with high-risk disease.

Notably, NPM1 mutations are always accompanied by additional mutations such as those in cohesin genes RAD21, SMC1A, SMC3, and STAG2 but not in the cohesin regulator, nipped B-like (NIPBL). In this work, we analyzed a cohort of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia and NPM1 mutation and observed a specific reduction in the expression of NIPBL but not in other cohesin genes. In our zebrafish model, overexpression of the mutated form of NPM1 also induced downregulation of nipblb, the zebrafish ortholog of human NIPBL To investigate the hematopoietic phenotype and the interaction between mutated NPM1 and nipblb, we generated a zebrafish model with nipblb downregulation which showed an increased number of myeloid progenitors. This phenotype was due to hyper-activation of the canonical Wnt pathway: myeloid cells blocked in an undifferentiated state could be rescued when the Wnt pathway was inhibited by dkk1b mRNA injection or indomethacin administration. Our results reveal, for the first time, a role for NIPBL during zebrafish hematopoiesis and suggest that an interplay between NIPBL/NPM1 may regulate myeloid differentiation in zebrafish and humans through the canonical Wnt pathway and that dysregulation of these interactions may drive leukemic transformation.","['Mazzola, Mara', 'Deflorian, Gianluca', 'Pezzotta, Alex', 'Ferrari, Laura', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Bresciani, Erica', 'Saitta, Claudia', 'Ferrari, Luca', 'Fumagalli, Monica', 'Parma, Matteo', 'Marasca, Federica', 'Bodega, Beatrice', 'Riva, Paola', 'Cotelli, Franco', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Marozzi, Anna', 'Cazzaniga, Gianni', 'Pistocchi, Anna']","['Mazzola M', 'Deflorian G', 'Pezzotta A', 'Ferrari L', 'Fazio G', 'Bresciani E', 'Saitta C', 'Ferrari L', 'Fumagalli M', 'Parma M', 'Marasca F', 'Bodega B', 'Riva P', 'Cotelli F', 'Biondi A', 'Marozzi A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Pistocchi A']",,"['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy.', 'Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare, IFOM, Milano, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy.', 'Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare, IFOM, Milano, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Centro Maria Letizia Verga, Monza, Italy.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Centro Maria Letizia Verga, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica e Centro Trapianti di Midollo Osseo, Ospedale San Gerardo, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica e Centro Trapianti di Midollo Osseo, Ospedale San Gerardo, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"" (INGM), Milano, Italy.', 'Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"" (INGM), Milano, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Centro Maria Letizia Verga, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Centro Maria Letizia Verga, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Segrate, Italy anna.pistocchi@unimi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (NIPBL protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (cohesins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Zebrafish']",PMC6601076,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.200899 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.200899 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jul;104(7):1332-1341. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.200899.

Nuclear-localized beta-catenin is indicative of active Wnt signaling and is frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients; however, some patients exhibit little or no nuclear beta-catenin even where cytosolic beta-catenin is abundant. Control of the subcellular localization of beta-catenin therefore represents an additional mechanism regulating Wnt signaling in hematopoietic cells. To investigate the factors mediating the nuclear-localization of beta-catenin, we carried out the first nuclear/cytoplasmic proteomic analysis of the beta-catenin interactome in myeloid leukemia cells and identified putative novel beta-catenin interactors. Comparison of interacting factors between Wnt-responsive cells (high nuclear beta-catenin) versus Wnt-unresponsive cells (low nuclear beta-catenin) suggested the transcriptional partner, LEF-1, could direct the nuclear-localization of beta-catenin. The relative levels of nuclear LEF-1 and beta-catenin were tightly correlated in both cell lines and in primary AML blasts. Furthermore, LEF-1 knockdown perturbed beta-catenin nuclear-localization and transcriptional activation in Wnt-responsive cells. Conversely, LEF-1 overexpression was able to promote both nuclear-localization and beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional responses in previously Wnt-unresponsive cells. This is the first beta-catenin interactome study in hematopoietic cells and reveals LEF-1 as a mediator of nuclear beta- catenin level in human myeloid leukemia.","['Morgan, Rhys G', 'Ridsdale, Jenna', 'Payne, Megan', 'Heesom, Kate J', 'Wilson, Marieangela C', 'Davidson, Andrew', 'Greenhough, Alexander', 'Davies, Sara', 'Williams, Ann C', 'Blair, Allison', 'Waterman, Marian L', 'Tonks, Alex', 'Darley, Richard L']","['Morgan RG', 'Ridsdale J', 'Payne M', 'Heesom KJ', 'Wilson MC', 'Davidson A', 'Greenhough A', 'Davies S', 'Williams AC', 'Blair A', 'Waterman ML', 'Tonks A', 'Darley RL']",,"['School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK darley@cardiff.ac.uk rhys.morgan@sussex.ac.uk.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'University of Bristol Proteomics Facility, UK.', 'University of Bristol Proteomics Facility, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, UK darley@cardiff.ac.uk rhys.morgan@sussex.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['11975/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT1 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt1 Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6601079,,2019/01/12 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.202846 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.202846 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jul;104(7):1365-1377. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.202846.

In this randomized phase 3 study (HOVON97) in older patients (>/=60 years) with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia with excess of blasts, in CR/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) after at least 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy, we assessed the value of azacitidine as postremission therapy with respect to disease-free survival (DFS; primary end point) and overall survival (OS; secondary end point). In total, 116 eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either observation (N = 60) or azacitidine maintenance (N = 56; 50 mg/m(2), subcutaneously, days 1-5, every 4 weeks) until relapse, for a maximum of 12 cycles. Fifty-five patients received at least 1 cycle of azacitidine, 46 at least 4 cycles, and 35 at least 12 cycles. The maintenance treatment with azacitidine was feasible. DFS was significantly better for the azacitidine treatment group (logrank; P = .04), as well as after adjustment for poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis and platelet count at randomization (as surrogate for CR vs CRi; Cox regression; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.95; P = .026). The 12-month DFS was estimated at 64% for the azacitidine group and 42% for the control group. OS did not differ between treatment groups, with and without censoring for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Rescue treatment was used more often in the observation group (n = 32) than in the azacitidine maintenance group (n = 9).

Priapism occurring in a setting of any leukemia is both a medical and a urological emergency that requires immediate local therapy, symptomatic treatment, cytoreductive therapy and early initiation of targeted therapy.

However, this translocation is also found in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), as well as in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Most patients with CML harbor either the e13a2 or the e14a2 BCR-ABL fusion product, while a small subset of the cases expresses e1a2 or e19a2 transcripts. Moreover, several atypical BCR-ABL1 transcripts, beside the most common e1a2, e13a2 and e14a2, have been described, mainly in patients with CML. However, ALL and de novo AML may also carry BCR-ABL1 atypical transcripts which will confer a poor prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-years old male was admitted at our hospital with clinical and laboratory features allowing to make the diagnosis of AML. No evidence of a preceding CML (splenomegaly or basophilia) was found. The karyotype on G-banded metaphases was 46,XY, t(9;22)(q34;q11). While the molecular analysis was ongoing, the patient started treatment based on hydroxyurea followed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The molecular biology analysis revealed the simultaneous presence of the common p190 e1a2 and the rare e6a2 isoforms. Because of persistent pancytopenia and presence of blasts, according to the molecular data, he was then switched to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment. Nevertheless, after 2 months, the patient was still refractory to second line treatment dying because of a pulmonary infection. CONCLUSION: The atypical p190 e6a2 transcript seems to be associated in AML with aggressive disease. TKI therapy alone does not seem to control the disease. Prompt observations on these patients carrying rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts may help to establish optimal treatment approaches on these aggressive BCR-ABL1 phenotypes in different setting of patients.","['Piedimonte, Monica', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Alfonso, Valentina', 'Ferrari, Antonella', 'Conte, Esmeralda', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Bianchi, Maria Paola', 'Ricciardi, Maria Rosaria', 'Mirabilii, Simone', 'Licchetta, Roberto', 'Campagna, Alessia', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Galassi, Giulia', 'Pelliccia, Sabrina', 'Leporace, Annapaola', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Tafuri, Agostino']","['Piedimonte M', 'Ottone T', 'Alfonso V', 'Ferrari A', 'Conte E', 'Divona M', 'Bianchi MP', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Mirabilii S', 'Licchetta R', 'Campagna A', 'Cicconi L', 'Galassi G', 'Pelliccia S', 'Leporace A', 'Lo Coco F', 'Tafuri A']",,"[""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Hematology Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. agostino.tafuri@uniroma1.it.""]",['eng'],"['C26A14CPRB, C26A158NJR, RM116154EC670667 RP11715C7D08BDC2, and', 'RM11715C7D01147A/Sapienza Universita di Roma']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6329120,,2019/01/12 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2019/01/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5265-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5265-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jan 10;19(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5265-5.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Atypical transcripts', 'BCR-ABL1 e6a2', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'TKI']",,,20190110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of casticin on immune responses and the survival rate of WEHI-3 cells generated in leukemia mice in vivo. Animals were divided into six groups: normal control mice, leukemia control mice, mice treated with ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), and casticin (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg) treated mice. All animals were treated for 14 days and then measured for body weights, total survival rate, cell markers, the weights of liver and spleen, phagocytosis of spleen cells, NK cell activities and cell proliferation. Results show that casticin did not affect animal appearances, however, it increased body weights and decreased the weights of liver at 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg treatment. Casticin also decreased spleen weight at 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg treatment, increased CD3 at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg doses and increased CD19 at 0.2 mg/kg treatment but decreased CD11b and Mac-3 at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg treatment.

Furthermore, casticin increased NK cells' cytotoxic activity and promoted T cell proliferation at 0.1-0.4 mg/kg treatment with or without concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation, but only increased B cell proliferation at 0.1 mg/kg treatment.

Our previous study determined that obesity-mediated chronic inflammation elicits sex-specific impairment in reproductive function via reduction in spine density in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Neuroinflammation and subsequent decrease in GnRH neuron spine density was specific for male mice, while protection in females was independent of ovarian estrogens. METHODS: To examine if neuroinflammation-induced cytokines can directly regulate GnRH gene expression, herein we examined signaling pathways and mechanisms in males in vivo and in GnRH-expressing cell line, GT1-7. RESULTS: GnRH neurons express cytokine receptors, and chronic or acute neuroinflammation represses GnRH gene expression in vivo. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in particular represses GnRH expression in GT1-7 cells, while other cytokines do not. STAT3 and MAPK pathways are activated following LIF treatment, but only MAPK pathway, specifically p38alpha, is sufficient to repress the GnRH gene. LIF induces cFOS that represses the GnRH gene via the -1,793 site in the enhancer region. In vivo, following high-fat diet, cFOS is induced in GnRH neurons and neurons juxtaposed to the leaky blood brain barrier of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, but not in the neurons further away. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the increase in LIF due to neuroinflammation induces cFOS and represses the GnRH gene. Therefore, in addition to synaptic changes in GnRH neurons, neuroinflammatory cytokines directly regulate gene expression and reproductive function, and the specificity for neuronal targets may stem from the proximity to the fenestrated capillaries.","['Lainez, Nancy M', 'Coss, Djurdjica']","['Lainez NM', 'Coss D']",,"['Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California, USA, djurdjica.coss@ucr.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 HD091167/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Neuroendocrinology,Neuroendocrinology,0035665,"['0 (Fos protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*metabolism', 'Hypothalamus/*metabolism', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC6561803,['NIHMS1023053'],2019/01/11 06:00,2019/12/27 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['000496754 [pii]', '10.1159/000496754 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroendocrinology. 2019;108(4):291-307. doi: 10.1159/000496754.

However, cardiotoxicity of these agents remains a serious concern. The underlying mechanism of these adverse cardiac effects is largely unknown. Delineation of the underlying mechanisms of TKIs associated cardiac dysfunction could guide potential prevention strategies, rescue approaches, and future drug design. This study aimed to determine the cardiotoxic potential of approved CML TKIs, define the associated signalling mechanism and identify potential alternatives. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we employed a zebrafish transgenic BNP reporter line that expresses luciferase under control of the nppb promoter (nppb:F-Luciferase) to assess the cardiotoxicity of all approved CML TKIs. Our in vivo screen identified ponatinib as the most cardiotoxic agent among the approved CML TKIs. Then using a combination of zebrafish and isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we delineated the signalling mechanism of ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity by demonstrating that ponatinib inhibits cardiac prosurvival signalling pathways AKT and extra-cellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. As a proof of concept, we augmented AKT and ERK signalling by administration of Neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta), and this prevented ponatinib-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We also demonstrate that ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity is not mediated by inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signalling, a well-known target of ponatinib. Finally, our comparative profiling for the cardiotoxic potential of CML approved TKIs, identified asciminib (ABL001) as a potentially much less cardiotoxic treatment option for CML patients with the T315I mutation. CONCLUSION: Herein, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods to systematically screen CML TKIs for cardiotoxicity, identify novel molecular mechanisms for TKI cardiotoxicity, and identify less cardiotoxic alternatives.","['Singh, Anand P', 'Glennon, Michael S', 'Umbarkar, Prachi', 'Gupte, Manisha', 'Galindo, Cristi L', 'Zhang, Qinkun', 'Force, Thomas', 'Becker, Jason R', 'Lal, Hind']","['Singh AP', 'Glennon MS', 'Umbarkar P', 'Gupte M', 'Galindo CL', 'Zhang Q', 'Force T', 'Becker JR', 'Lal H']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Pittsburgh Heart, Lung, Blood, and Vascular Medicine Institute, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 200 Lothrop, BST E1258, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Pittsburgh Heart, Lung, Blood, and Vascular Medicine Institute, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 200 Lothrop, BST E1258, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2220 Pierce Ave, PRB#348A, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL116803/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL133290/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL136824/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (asciminib)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Imidazoles/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/genetics/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Proof of Concept Study', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/toxicity', 'Pyridazines/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Zebrafish/embryology/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6452321,,2019/01/11 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5284910 [pii]', '10.1093/cvr/cvz006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2019 Apr 15;115(5):966-977. doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvz006.,"['Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

These diets are restrictive and are associated with lower patient satisfaction and possibly malnutrition. Further, it is unclear if these restrictive diets are effective in reducing infection. We performed a meta-analysis on the rates of infection reported in trials comparing the neutropenic diet to unrestricted diets in cancer patients with neutropenia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive database search for all published randomized controlled trials comparing infection rates in cancer patients receiving a neutropenic diet versus an unrestricted diet was performed for all publications in English language from database's inception until September 12, 2017. The search strategy, study selection, and subsequent analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Random effects modeling was used to obtain pooled relative risks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of infection. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 388 patients were included in the final analysis. Patients mostly had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or sarcoma. Infection was noted in 53.7% patients in the neutropenic diet group, as compared with 50% in the unrestricted diet group. No significant difference in infection rate was observed between the neutropenic diet versus unrestricted diet groups, pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.13 (95% CI, 0.98-1.30; P=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that the use of neutropenic diet was not associated with decreased risk of infection in neutropenic cancer patients. The continued use of neutropenic diets should be questioned.","['Ball, Somedeb', 'Brown, Timothy J', 'Das, Avash', 'Khera, Rohan', 'Khanna, Sahil', 'Gupta, Arjun']","['Ball S', 'Brown TJ', 'Das A', 'Khera R', 'Khanna S', 'Gupta A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Cardiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['*Diet', 'Humans', 'Infection Control/*statistics & numerical data', 'Infections/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*diet therapy/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/COC.0000000000000514 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar;42(3):270-274. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000514.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to construct a gene expression classifier and to screen key genes associated with GBM prognosis. GSE7696 microarray data set included samples from 10 recurrent GBM tissues, 70 primary GBM tissues and 4 normal brain tissues. Seed genes were identified by the 'survival' package in R and subjected to pathway enrichment analysis. Prognostic genes were selected from the seed genes using the 'rbsurv' package in R, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, survival analysis and enrichment analysis. Multivariate survival analysis was performed for the prognostic genes, and the GBM data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was utilized to validate the prognostic genes. Of the 1,785 seed genes analyzed, 13 prognostic feature genes, including collagen type XXVIII alpha1 chain (COL28A1), PDS5 cohesinassociated factor A (PDS5A), zincfinger DHHCtype containing 2 (ZDHHC2), zincfinger protein 24 (ZNF24), myosin VA (MYO5A) and myeloid/lymphoid or mixedlineage leukemia translocated to 4 (MLLT4), were identified. These genes performed well on sample classification and prognostic risk differentiation, and six pathways, including adherens junction, cyclic adenosine 3',5'monophosphate signaling and Ras signaling pathways, were enriched for these feature genes. The highrisk group was slightly older compared with the lowrisk group. The validation data set confirmed the prognostic value of the 13 feature genes for GBM; of these, COL28A1, PDS5A, ZDHHC2, ZNF24, MYO5A and MLLT4 may be crucial. These results may aid the understanding of the pathogenesis of GBM and provide important clues for the development of novel diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.","['Yang, Huyin', 'Jin, Luhao', 'Sun, Xiaoyang']","['Yang H', 'Jin L', 'Sun X']",,"[""Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, P.R.

Accordingly, perturbation of PLZF function results in a myriad of physiologic defects, the most conspicuous of which is abnormal skeletal patterning. Although whole body knockout of Plzf in the mouse (Plzf (KO) ) has significantly expanded our understanding of Plzf function in vivo, a conditional knockout mouse model that enables tissue or cell-type specific ablation of Plzf has not been developed. Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing to generate a mouse model in which exon 2 of the murine Plzf gene is specifically flanked (or floxed) by LoxP sites (Plzf (f/f) ). Crossing our Plzf (f/f) mouse with a global cre-driver mouse to generate the Plzf (d/d) bigenic mouse, we demonstrate that exon 2 of the Plzf gene is ablated in the Plzf (d/d) bigenic. Similar to the previously reported Plzf (KO) mouse, the Plzf (d/d) mouse exhibits a severe defect in skeletal patterning of the hindlimb, indicating that the Plzf (f/f) mouse functions as designed. Therefore, studies in this short technical report demonstrate that the Plzf (f/f) mouse will be useful to investigators who wish to explore the role of the Plzf transcription factor in a specific tissue or cell-type.","['Hai, Lan', 'Szwarc, Maria M', 'Lanza, Denise G', 'Heaney, Jason D', 'Lydon, John P']","['Hai L', 'Szwarc MM', 'Lanza DG', 'Heaney JD', 'Lydon JP']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9668-7593', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2715-2752', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6472-636X']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD042311/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD042311/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U42 HG0063521/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",100931242,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Bone and Bones/abnormalities/embryology', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Gene Knockout Techniques/methods', 'Hindlimb/abnormalities/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/deficiency/*genetics']",PMC6422732,['NIHMS1013296'],2019/01/11 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvg.23281 [doi]'],ppublish,Genesis. 2019 Mar;57(3):e23281. doi: 10.1002/dvg.23281.

The role for Emx2 is best understood within the context of the development of the neocortical region of the cortex, where Emx2 is expressed in a high posterior-medial to low anterior-lateral gradient that regulates the partitioning of the neocortex into different functional fields that perform discrete computational tasks. Despite several lines of evidence demonstrating an Emx2 concentration-dependent mechanism for establishing functional areas within the developing neocortex, little is known about how Emx2 physically carries out this role. Although several binding partners for Emx2 have been identified (including Sp8, eIF4E, and Pbx1), no screens have been used to identify potential protein binding partners for this protein. We utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen using a library constructed from embryonic mouse cDNA in an attempt to identify novel binding partners for Emx2. This initial screen isolated two potential Emx2-binding partner proteins, Cnot6l and QkI-7. These novel Emx2-binding proteins are involved in multiple levels of mRNA metabolism that including splicing, mRNA export, translation, and destruction, thus making them interesting targets for further study.","['Groves, Jennifer A', 'Gillman, Cody', 'DeLay, Cierra N', 'Kroll, Todd T']","['Groves JA', 'Gillman C', 'DeLay CN', 'Kroll TT']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9605-8359'],"['Department of Chemistry, Central Washington University, 400 E.

The patient initially presented with cotton wool spots in the fundus shortly after starting the regimen. After going through the induction phase of chemotherapy, he had a sudden decline in his vision to light perception in the left eye. Posterior segment exam revealed retinal ischemia and multilayered hemorrhages in both eyes as well as a large preretinal hemorrhage obscuring the fovea in the left eye. Labs associated the appearance of these hemorrhages with a significant decrease in hemoglobin and a platelet count of 5 K/muL. A Nd:YAG laser applied in the left eye at the posterior hyaloid face allowed blood to drain into the vitreous cavity and brought the patient's visual acuity back to baseline.

In cases of impending vision loss where vitreous biopsy cannot provide a definitive diagnosis, transvitreal retinochoroidal biopsy can be an effective next step. Our case is a 48-year-old male with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that presented with counting fingers vision, redness, and tearing of the left eye. Exam showed cell and flare with hypopyon as well as dense vitritis. The patient underwent diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and vitreous culture was negative at the time. Flow cytometry demonstrated no malignant cells. However, the patient's vision and mental status continued to clinically decline despite being started on intravitreal and systemic antibiotic and antifungal therapy. Neuroimaging revealed rim-enhancing brain lesions. Transvitreal retinochoroidal biopsy was performed in an elevated area of the retina.

Ultimately, the vitreous biopsy, cultures, and a biopsy from the left frontal lobe brain abscess all confirmed this diagnosis as well.

Despite the beneficial impact of allo-HCT, its adverse effects cause severe health concerns. After transplantation, recognition of host cells as foreign entities by donor T cells induces graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Activation, proliferation and trafficking of donor T cells to target organs and tissues are critical steps in the pathogenesis of GVHD. T cell activation is a synergistic process of T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-anchored antigen and co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory signaling in the presence of cytokines. Most of the currently used therapeutic regimens for GVHD are based on inhibiting the allogeneic T cell response or T-cell depletion (TCD). However, the immunosuppressive drugs and TCD hamper the therapeutic potential of allo-HCT, resulting in attenuated graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect as well as increased vulnerability to infection. In view of the drawback of overbroad immunosuppression, co-stimulatory, and co-inhibitory molecules are plausible targets for selective modulation of T cell activation and function that can improve the effectiveness of allo-HCT. Therefore, this review collates existing knowledge of T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition with current research that may have the potential to provide novel approaches to cure GVHD without sacrificing the beneficial effects of allo-HCT.","['Kumar, Sandeep', 'Leigh, Nicholas D', 'Cao, Xuefang']","['Kumar S', 'Leigh ND', 'Cao X']",,"['Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States.']",['eng'],['R01 HL135325/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6309815,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03003 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 21;9:3003. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03003. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*T cells', '*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)', '*co-stimulation/co-inhibition', '*graft -vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect', '*graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD)']",,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the French-American-British (FAB) system, monocytic leukemia is classified as M5. Myeloid sarcoma further occurs in 3-5% of AML. This is defined as an extramedullary tumor of myeloid cells in the lymph nodes, soft tissues, periosteum, bone, central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, intestine, mediastinum, prostate, uterus, or ovaries. Case Presentation: Here, we describe the case of a 29-year-old female who presented with fever, swelling of gums, neck pain, and weakness, which had persisted for 1 week. The patient had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 53.5 K/muL, and a peripheral smear revealed a myeloid blast cell (blast) percentage of 8%. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck indicated lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration of the cervical lymph node showed groups of atypical immature myeloid cells, mixed with occasional megakaryocytes, and infiltration of eosinophilic myeloid cells into the lymph node, consistent with myeloid sarcoma. Flow cytometry analysis revealed intermediate to large circulating blasts, with irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and distinct nucleoli, indicative of AML, with monocytic differentiation. The patient responded well to chemotherapy with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and idarubicin; WBC counts returned to normal and patient was discharged to home. Conclusion: Myeloid sarcoma of the lymph node is a rare co-occurrence with AML. Results of our study are consistent with the conclusion that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment improve survival.","['Khaja, Misbahuddin', 'Omesh, Toolsie', 'Niazi, Masooma', 'Shaikh, Danial', 'Mudunuru, Sitarama Arvind', 'Reyes, Olga Alexandra', 'Malik, Sandeep']","['Khaja M', 'Omesh T', 'Niazi M', 'Shaikh D', 'Mudunuru SA', 'Reyes OA', 'Malik S']",,"['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Division of Pathology, Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Bronx Care Health System, Affiliated with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bronx, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,PMC6323399,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/01/11 06:01,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000494830 [doi]', 'cro-0011-0791 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2018 Nov 29;11(3):791-799. doi: 10.1159/000494830. eCollection 2018 Sep-Dec.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Monocytic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Myeloid Sarcoma', 'Myeloid cell tumor', 'Myeloperoxidase reaction']",,,20181129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal counterparts of BPDCN tumor cells are progenitors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas the origins are thought to be hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 10%-20% of BPDCN patients develop other hematologic malignancies, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Mutations in epigenetic regulators are frequently observed in both BPDCN and CMML tumors. Azacitidine, a drug that targets epigenetic dysregulation, is known to be an effective treatment for CMML. However, it has been used in few BPDCN patients. Here, we report a BPDCN patient with skin lesions, bone marrow infiltration, and lymphadenopathy. CMML also developed during the course of BPDCN. Azacitidine had positive effects on CMML; however, BPDCN aggressively relapsed during treatment. Two TET2 mutations were found in both BPDCN and CMML tumors; one of which was commonly identified in both tumors.","['Sukegawa, Shinichiro', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Matsuoka, Ryota', 'Momose, Haruka', 'Kiyoki, Yusuke', 'Noguchi, Masayuki', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Watanabe, Rei', 'Fujimoto, Manabu', 'Yokoyama, Yasuhisa', 'Nishikii, Hidekazu', 'Kato, Takayasu', 'Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Kurita, Naoki', 'Obara, Naoshi', 'Hasegawa, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Sukegawa S', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Matsuoka R', 'Momose H', 'Kiyoki Y', 'Noguchi M', 'Nakamura N', 'Watanabe R', 'Fujimoto M', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Nishikii H', 'Kato T', 'Kusakabe M', 'Kurita N', 'Obara N', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Chiba S']",,"['Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dioxygenases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy']",,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.59.2567 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2018;59(12):2567-2573. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.59.2567.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Azacitidine', 'BPDCN', 'CMML']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypertriglyceridemia immediately resolved after discontinuing L-asparaginase and beginning a lipid-restricted diet.

Critical components involved in this innate process are promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which are subnuclear structures required for the development of a robust IFN response. As such, PML-NBs serve as an important hurdle for viruses to overcome to successfully establish an infection. Both Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and the closely related rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) are unique for encoding viral homologs of IFN regulatory factors (termed vIRFs) that can manipulate the host immune response by multiple mechanisms. All four KSHV vIRFs inhibit the induction of IFN, while vIRF1 and vIRF2 can inhibit ISG induction downstream of the IFN receptor. Less is known about the RRV vIRFs. RRV vIRF R6 can inhibit the induction of IFN by IRF3; however, it is not known whether any RRV vIRFs inhibit ISG induction following IFN receptor signaling. In our present study, we demonstrate that the RRV vIRF R12 aids viral replication in the presence of the type I IFN response. This is achieved in part through the disruption of PML-NBs and the inhibition of robust ISG transcription.IMPORTANCE KSHV and RRV encode a unique set of homologs of cellular IFN regulatory factors, termed vIRFs, which are hypothesized to help these viruses evade the innate immune response and establish infections in their respective hosts. Our work elucidates the role of one RRV vIRF, R12, and demonstrates that RRV can dampen the type I IFN response downstream of IFN signaling, which would be important for establishing a successful infection in vivo.","['Springgay, Laura K', 'Fitzpatrick, Kristin', 'Park, Byung', 'Estep, Ryan D', 'Wong, Scott W']","['Springgay LK', 'Fitzpatrick K', 'Park B', 'Estep RD', 'Wong SW']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9457-2146'],"['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Oregon Health & Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA wongs@ohsu.edu.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Division of Pathobiology and Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['P51 OD011092/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007472/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI074494/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA206404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (viral interferon regulatory factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/genetics', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Interferon Type I/*genetics', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/virology', 'Macaca mulatta/*virology', 'Receptors, Interferon/genetics', 'Rhadinovirus/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",PMC6401433,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02147-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02147-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Mar 5;93(6). pii: JVI.02147-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02147-18.

To clarify the different impacts of ATG for conditioning across different donor types, we retrospectively analyzed patients with acute leukemia (n = 6617) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2008 and 2015 with ATG (n = 279) or without ATG (n = 6338). Because thymoglobulin is the only ATG drug approved for GVHD prophylaxis in Japan since September 2008, we included thymoglobulin alone in the present analysis. The survivors' median follow-up time was 1081 days. Patients were categorized into 5 groups: cord blood (CB; n = 1915), matched related donor (n = 1772), 1-antigen mismatched related donor (1-MMRD; n = 225), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 1742), and 1-allele mismatched unrelated donor (1-MMUD; n = 963). In multivariate analysis, ATG decreased overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.403; P = .054) and GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR, 1.458; P = .053) in association with increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR, 1.608; P =03) with CB, whereas it improved GRFS (HR, 0.515; P < .01) and decreased grades II to IV aGVHD (HR, 0.576; P < .01), extensive cGVHD (HR, 0.460; P = .02), and NRM (HR, 0.545; P = .03) with 1-MMUD. ATG did not impact survival with 1-MMRD and MUD. The use of ATG in conditioning is beneficial due to the reduction in acute/chronic GVHD without increasing NRM or disease relapse only in 1-MMUD transplantation.

Dysregulation of MLL1 catalytic function is relevant to mixed-lineage leukemia, and targeting WDR5-MLL1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for leukemia harboring MLL1 fusion proteins. To date, several peptidomimetic and non-peptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors targeting WDR5-MLL1 interaction have been reported, yet the discovery walk of new drugs inhibiting MLL1 methytransferase activity is still in its infancy. It's urgent to find other small-molecule WDR5-MLL1 inhibitors with novel scaffolds. In this study, through fluorescence polarization (FP)-based high throughput screening, several small-molecule inhibitors with potent inhibitory activities in vitro against WDR5-MLL1 interaction were discovered. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) assays were carried out to confirm the direct binding between hit compounds and WDR5. Subsequent similarity-based analog searching of the 4 hits led to several inhibitors with better activity, among them, DC_M5_2 displayed highest inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 9.63+/-1.46microM. Furthermore, a molecular docking study was performed and disclosed the binding modes and interaction mechanisms between two most potent inhibitors and WDR5.","['Ye, Xiaoqing', 'Zhang, Rukang', 'Lian, Fulin', 'Zhang, Weiyao', 'Lu, Wenchao', 'Han, Jie', 'Zhang, Naixia', 'Jin, Jia', 'Luo, Cheng', 'Chen, Kaixian', 'Ye, Fei', 'Ding, Hong']","['Ye X', 'Zhang R', 'Lian F', 'Zhang W', 'Lu W', 'Han J', 'Zhang N', 'Jin J', 'Luo C', 'Chen K', 'Ye F', 'Ding H']",,"['College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China; Open Studio for Druggability Research of Marine Natural Products, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), 1 Wenhai Road, Aoshanwei, Jimo, Qingdao 266237, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.

Methods The mSIRPalpha(ext) gene was amplified from mouse lymph node and the prokaryotic expression vector of pET32a-SIRPalpha(ext) was further constructed. After the soluble expression of recombinant Trx-mSIRPalpha(ext) fusion protein containing thioredoxin (Trx) tag was achieved, mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate into macrophages. Then the macrophages were co-cultured with L1210 leukemia cells labeled with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimide ester (CFSE). Trx-mSIRPalpha(ext) protein and Trx control protein were added into the co-culture system. The role of recombinant protein in the macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells was observed by immunofluorescence cytochemical staining and confocal microscopy. Results Purified soluble Trx-mSIRPalpha(ext) protein was obtained and it was showed that it could enhance the phagocytosis of macrophages in mouse L1210 leukemia cells in vitro phagocytosis experiments.

The blood concentration of Methotrexate is used to determine the regimen of folinic acid. However, the lower limit of Siemens assay kit is 0.30 mumol/L in China. This study extended the limit from 0.3 to 0.05 mumol/L and reduced the test cost by optimizing the parameters of Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique assay. METHODS: Parameters of Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique assay were modified to decrease the volume of reagents A and B. Then a standard curve with a new custom set of calibrators was prepared to detect low concentration. Intra-day and inter-day imprecision were assessed by control material and samples. The linearity of the modified assay was verified by analyzing a range of quality controls with known concentration from 0.05 to 1.00 mumol/L. At last, the same samples were tested by modified Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique assay and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry assay respectively. A simple linear regression was performed to verify the validity of the modified Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique assay. RESULTS: Intra-day and inter-day imprecision show good reproducibility at all levels (0.05, 0.12, 0.43, 0.82 mumol/L). The linearity equation of modified assay was y = 0.9913x + 0.0046, in which y was the mean of measured concentration and x was the target concentration (R(2) = 0.9994). In the range of 0.05-10.00 mumol/L, correlation between the Modified assay and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry assay was significant (r = 0.9968). In the range of 0.30-10.00 mumol/L, the correlation between modified and commercial assays was significant (r = 0.9987) as well. CONCLUSIONS: The modified assay enhanced the sensitivity of Siemens VIVA-E to 0.05 mumol/L. In addition, the test number of a reagent Kit increased from 140 to 210. This means the cost of detection was reduced about 30%.","['Shi, Xiaoping', 'Gao, Hui', 'Li, Zhong', 'Li, Jinghua', 'Liu, Yang', 'Li, Lujuan', 'Zhang, Qi']","['Shi X', 'Gao H', 'Li Z', 'Li J', 'Liu Y', 'Li L', 'Zhang Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1482-3035'],"[""Pharmacy Department of Dalian Children's Hospital, No.154, Zhongshan Road, Dalian City, 116012, Xigang District, China."", ""Hematology Ward of Dalian Children's Hospital, No.154, Zhongshan Road, Dalian City, 116012, Xigang District, China."", ""Pharmacy Department of Dalian Children's Hospital, No.154, Zhongshan Road, Dalian City, 116012, Xigang District, China.

We compared the incidence of aspergillosis before (May 2008) and during the construction of a new building (June 2008-January 2010) and in the early (February 2010-March 2014) and late (April 2014-March 2016) periods after moving to a new hematology ward with an LAF system. The 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycosis Study Group criteria were used for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were diagnosed with possible, probable, or definite aspergillosis. Cumulative incidence rates of aspergillosis at day 180 were 12.4, 24.9, 9.3, and 25.1% before construction, during construction, in the early period after moving to a new ward, and in the late period after moving to a new ward, respectively (p = 0.106). Multivariate analysis showed that the LAF system tended to reduce the risk of aspergillosis in the early period (before construction vs. early period; hazards ratio (HR) = 1.97, p = 0.463 and during construction vs. early period;HR = 3.42, p = 0.184), but the risk increased in the late period (late vs. early period, HR = 5.65, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Building construction might increase the risk of aspergillosis. Short-term LAF use might reduce aspergillosis risk, but its long-term use is inadequate, although we could not exclude the possibility of increased risks in the recent period due to continued improvements in the different areas of our hospital. Strict maintenance, more effective LAF system, and optimization of aspergillosis prophylaxis may be necessary.","['Iwasaki, Makoto', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Yamashita, Kouhei', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Iwasaki M', 'Kanda J', 'Hishizawa M', 'Kitano T', 'Kondo T', 'Yamashita K', 'Takaori-Kondo A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8959-6271'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. tadakazu@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['*Aspergillosis/complications/epidemiology', '*Environment, Controlled', 'Hospital Design and Construction/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC6327489,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-018-3665-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-018-3665-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Jan 9;19(1):38. doi: 10.1186/s12879-018-3665-9.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Aspergillosis', 'Fungal infection', 'Laminar air flow', 'Prevention']",,,20190109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The target level of plasma asparaginase activity to achieve asparagine depletion has been between 0.05 and 0.4 IU/mL. COG AALL07P4 examined the asparaginase activity and plasma and CSF asparagine concentration of pegaspargase when given intravenously in the treatment of NCI high risk ALL. Matched plasma asparaginase/asparagine levels of the clearance of 54 doses of pegaspargase given in induction or consolidation demonstrated that all patients who had a plasma asparaginase level >0.02 IU/mL had undetectable plasma asparagine. No difference was observed in CSF asparagine levels associated with matched plasma asparaginase levels of 0.02-0.049 versus 0.05-0.22 IU/mL (p = .25). Our data suggest that a plasma asparaginase activity level of 0.02 IU/mL can effectively deplete plasma asparagine.

The effects of Morniga-G were investigated on a Tn-positive leukemic Jurkat cell line. The lectin, used in a concentration range between 5(-)20 mug/mL, induced cell death in leukemic Jurkat cells. Microscopic and cytofluorometric analyses indicated that Jurkat cell death was essentially apoptotic, associated with an increase in the ceramide content and a depolarization of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. This lectin-mediated cell death was inhibited by the pan caspase-inhibitor zVAD. In addition, cleavage of caspases 8, 9, and 3 was observed in Morniga-G-treated Jurkat cells whereas Jurkat cell lines that are deficient in caspase 8(-)10, caspase 9, or FADD, survived to the lectin-mediated toxicity. Furthermore, in the presence of TRAIL- or DR5-blocking mononoclonal antibodies, Jurkat cells became resistant to Morniga-G, suggesting that the lectin triggers cell death via the TRAIL/DR5 pathway. In silico computer simulations suggest that Morniga-G might facilitate both the DR5 dimerization and the building of TRAIL/DR5 complexes. Finally, upon treatment of Jurkat cells with benzyl-GalNAc, an O-glycosylation inhibitor, a decrease in Tn antigen expression associating with a reduced Morniga-G toxicity, was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that Morniga-G induces the cell death of Tn-positive leukemic cells via concomitant O-glycosylation-, caspase-, and TRAIL/DR5-dependent pathways.","['Poiroux, Guillaume', 'Barre, Annick', 'Simplicien, Mathias', 'Pelofy, Sandrine', 'Segui, Bruno', 'Van Damme, Els J M', 'Rouge, Pierre', 'Benoist, Herve']","['Poiroux G', 'Barre A', 'Simplicien M', 'Pelofy S', 'Segui B', 'Van Damme EJM', 'Rouge P', 'Benoist H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9848-766X'],"['Universite de Toulouse, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM UMR 1037, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France. guillaumepoiroux@gmail.com.', 'Universite de Toulouse, UMR 152 PharmaDev, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Recherche et Developpement, Faculte de Pharmacie, 35 Chemin des Maraichers, 31062 Toulouse, France. annick.barre@univ-tlse3.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, UMR 152 PharmaDev, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Recherche et Developpement, Faculte de Pharmacie, 35 Chemin des Maraichers, 31062 Toulouse, France. simplicien.mathias@gmail.com.', 'Universite de Toulouse, UMR 152 PharmaDev, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Recherche et Developpement, Faculte de Pharmacie, 35 Chemin des Maraichers, 31062 Toulouse, France. sandrine.pelofy@gmail.com.', 'Universite de Toulouse, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM UMR 1037, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France. bruno.segui@inserm.fr.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.

It is well known that chemotherapy, used as anti-cancer therapy, adversely affects male fertility. Moreover, the negative effect of leukemia on sperm quality, even before chemotherapy treatment, has been reported. However, the mechanisms behind this disease's effect on sperm quality remains unknown. In this study, we examine the direct effect of leukemia and chemotherapy alone and in combination on sperm parameters and male fertility. For this, we developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model (mice were treated with AML cells C1498 and developed leukemia); these mice then received cytarabine chemotherapy. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in sperm concentration and motility and a significant increase in abnormal morphology and spontaneous acrosome reaction of the sperm following AML and chemotherapy treatment, alone and in combination. We also found a reduction in male fertility and the number of delivered offspring. Our results support previous findings that AML impairs sperm parameters and show for the first time that AML increases spontaneous acrosome reaction and decreases male fertility capacity and number of offspring.","['Michailov, Yulia', 'Lunenfeld, Eitan', 'Kapilushnik, Joseph', 'Friedler, Shevach', 'Meese, Eckart', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud']","['Michailov Y', 'Lunenfeld E', 'Kapilushnik J', 'Friedler S', 'Meese E', 'Huleihel M']",,"['The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics, The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. yuliadiuro@gmail.com.', 'IVF Unit, Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon 7830604, Israel. yuliadiuro@gmail.com.', 'The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), Department OB/GYN, Soroka Medical Center and Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. lunenfld@bgu.ac.il.', 'The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. kapelush@bgu.ac.il.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. kapelush@bgu.ac.il.', 'IVF Unit, Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon 7830604, Israel. shevachf@bmc.gov.il.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. shevachf@bmc.gov.il.', 'Department of OBGYN and Infertility, Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon 7830604, Israel. shevachf@bmc.gov.il.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, 66421 Homburg, Germany. eckart.meese@uks.eu.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics, The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel. huleihel@bgu.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['000/The Kahn Foundation', '0000/Ben-Gurion University of the Negev']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['*Acrosome Reaction/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Fertility/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Sperm Motility/drug effects', 'Spermatozoa/drug effects/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6337746,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20010219 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20010219 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 8;20(1). pii: ijms20010219. doi: 10.3390/ijms20010219.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acrosome reaction', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'male infertility', 'sperm parameters', 'testis']",,,20190108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metaproteomics is also attracting considerable attention, and such data can be efficiently generated today owing to improvements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. As we will discuss in this study, there are still major challenges notably in data analysis that need to be overcome. Here, we analyzed 212 fecal samples from 56 hospitalized acute leukemia patients with multidrug-resistant Enterobactericeae (MRE) gut colonization using metagenomics and metaproteomics. This is one of the largest clinical metaproteomic studies to date, and the first metaproteomic study addressing the gut microbiome in MRE colonized acute leukemia patients. Based on this substantial data set, we discuss major current limitations in clinical metaproteomic data analysis to provide guidance to researchers in the field. Notably, the results show that public metagenome databases are incomplete and that sample-specific metagenomes improve results. Furthermore, biological variation is tremendous which challenges clinical study designs and argues that longitudinal measurements of individual patients are a valuable future addition to the analysis of patient cohorts.","['Rechenberger, Julia', 'Samaras, Patroklos', 'Jarzab, Anna', 'Behr, Juergen', 'Frejno, Martin', 'Djukovic, Ana', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Gonzalez-Barbera, Eva M', 'Salavert, Miguel', 'Lopez-Hontangas, Jose Luis', 'Xavier, Karina B', 'Debrauwer, Laurent', 'Rolain, Jean-Marc', 'Sanz, Miguel', 'Garcia-Garcera, Marc', 'Wilhelm, Mathias', 'Ubeda, Carles', 'Kuster, Bernhard']","['Rechenberger J', 'Samaras P', 'Jarzab A', 'Behr J', 'Frejno M', 'Djukovic A', 'Sanz J', 'Gonzalez-Barbera EM', 'Salavert M', 'Lopez-Hontangas JL', 'Xavier KB', 'Debrauwer L', 'Rolain JM', 'Sanz M', 'Garcia-Garcera M', 'Wilhelm M', 'Ubeda C', 'Kuster B']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4189-3434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6651-1773', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5210-1434', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1489-1177', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9224-3258', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9094-1677']","['Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. julia.rechenberger@tum.de.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. patroklos.samaras@tum.de.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. anna.jarzab@tum.de.', 'Bavarian Center for Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. juergen.behr@tum.de.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. martin.frejno@tum.de.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, 46020 Valencia, Spain. adjukovic@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain. sanz_jai@gva.es.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain. sanz_jai@gva.es.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain. evamariagonzalezbarbera@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain. salavert_mig@gva.es.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain. lopez_jlu@gva.es.', 'Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, 2780 Oeiras, Portugal. kxavier@igc.gulbenkian.pt.', 'Toxalim, Universite de Toulouse, INRA, INP-ENVT, INP-EI-Purpan, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, 31027 Toulouse, France. laurent.debrauwer@inra.fr.', 'Axiom Platform, UMR 1331 Toxalim, MetaToul-MetaboHUB, National Infrastructure of Metabolomics and Fluxomics, 31027 Toulouse, France. laurent.debrauwer@inra.fr.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-Mediterranee Infection, 13385 Marseille, France. jean-marc.rolain@univ-amu.fr.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain. sanz_mig@gva.es.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain. sanz_mig@gva.es.', 'Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland. marc.garcia.garcera@gmail.com.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. mathias.wilhelm@tum.de.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, 46020 Valencia, Spain. ubeda_carmor@gva.es.', 'Centers of Biomedical Research Network (CIBER) in Epidemiology and Public Health, 28029 Madrid, Spain. ubeda_carmor@gva.es.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. kuster@tum.de.', 'Bavarian Center for Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany. kuster@tum.de.']",['eng'],['031L0089/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Proteomes,Proteomes,101621966,,,,PMC6473847,,2019/01/11 06:00,2019/01/11 06:01,['2019/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['proteomes7010002 [pii]', '10.3390/proteomes7010002 [doi]']",epublish,Proteomes. 2019 Jan 8;7(1). pii: proteomes7010002. doi: 10.3390/proteomes7010002.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical proteomics', 'data analysis', 'human gut microbiome', 'mass spectrometry', 'metaproteome', 'multi-omics', 'multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'proteomics']",,,20190108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with children (age <15 years), adolescents and young adults (AYA; age 15 to 39 years) undergoing HCT have an increased risk for transplantation-related complications. However, whether such complications translate into increased resource utilization and costs during HCT remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter database study using the Pediatric Health Information System database, an administrative database containing resource utilization data from 49 US tertiary children's hospitals to compare inpatient costs and resource utilization in children and AYA undergoing HCT for acute leukemia and MDS. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify HCT recipients and transplantation-related complications occurring up to 1 year post-HCT. We identified 1693 HCT recipients at pediatric centers between January 2010 and September 2014. Eighty percent of the total costs (from admission for HCT up to 1 year post-HCT) occurred during the initial transplantation admission. During initial admission, although AYA and children had a similar median length of stay (LOS) of 43 days, AYA incurred significantly greater adjusted costs ($338,458 versus $275,723; P < .001) and costs per hospital day ($7122 versus $5838; P < .001). Median total costs and costs per day during subsequent time periods post-HCT were also significantly greater in the AYA group. In multivariable analysis, increasing age at HCT, LOS, use of cord blood or an unrelated donor, occurrence of any graft-versus-host disease, infection, and use of dialysis or mechanical ventilation were significant drivers of increased cost at initial admission. In conclusion, allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia and MDS is associated with higher costs in AYA recipients than in children. Therefore, directing efforts and resources aimed at reducing HCT-related costs may be advantageous in this high-risk group.","['Rangarajan, Hemalatha G', 'Smith, Lauren C', 'Stanek, Joseph R', 'Hall, Matthew', 'Abu-Arja, Rolla', 'Auletta, Jeffery J', ""O'Brien, Sarah H""]","['Rangarajan HG', 'Smith LC', 'Stanek JR', 'Hall M', 'Abu-Arja R', 'Auletta JJ', ""O'Brien SH""]",,"[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

Null mutations of Mll1 in tumor mice and in xenotransplanted human head and neck tumors resulted in loss of self-renewal of tumor-propagating cells and in block of tumor formation but did not alter normal tissue homeostasis. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and pharmacological interference of Mll1 at sequences that inhibit essential protein-protein interactions or the SET enzyme active site also blocked the self-renewal of mouse and human tumor-propagating cells.

KMT2A is translocated to multiple partner genes, including MLLT10/AF10 localizing at chromosomal band 10p12. KMT2A-MLLT10 is one of the common chimeric genes diagnosed in acute leukemia with KMT2A rearrangement (8%), especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 18%). MLLT10 is localized in very close proximity to two other KMT2A partner genes at 10p11-12-NEBL and ABI1, so they could not be distinguished by conventional cytogenetics. METHODS: In this work, we present a cohort of 28 patients enrolled into Russian Pediatric AML registration study carrying rearrangements between chromosomal regions 11q23.3 and 10p11-12. G-banding, FISH, reverse transcription PCR, and long-distance inverse PCR were used to characterize the KMT2A gene rearrangements in these patients.

METHODS: A total of 146 de novo pediatric AML patients and 73 nonhematologic malignancy patients/donors were recruited. Bone marrow samples were obtained, followed by measurement of lnc-SOX6-1 expression by qPCR. Besides, lnc-SOX6-1 expression in various AML cells and control cells was detected. Blank overexpression (NC (+)), lnc-SOX6-1 overexpression (Lnc RNA (+)), blank shRNA (NC (-)), and lnc-SOX6-1 shRNA plasmids (Lnc RNA (-)) were transferred into KG-1 cells and THP-1 cells. Cell proliferation rate and cell apoptosis rate were detected by CCK-8 assay and AV/PI assay, respectively. RESULTS: Lnc-SOX6-1 expression was upregulated in pediatric AML patients compared to controls, and its high expression correlated with the presence of monosomal karyotype, severer risk stratification, lower possibility of complete response achievement, shorter event-free survival, and poor overall survival. Furthermore, lnc-SOX6-1 expression was elevated in various AML cells compared to normal cells. In KG-1 cells and THP-1 cells, cell proliferation rate was elevated in Lnc RNA (+) group but reduced in Lnc RNA (-) group at 48 and 72 hours, and cell apoptosis rate was decreased in Lnc RNA (+) group but increased in Lnc RNA (-) group at 72 hours compared to the corresponding control groups. CONCLUSION: Lnc-SOX6-1 is highly expressed and correlates with worse risk stratification and poor treatment outcomes, and promotes cell proliferation while represses apoptosis in pediatric AML.","['Guan, Xianmin', 'Wen, Xianhao', 'Xiao, Jianwen', 'An, Xizhou', 'Yu, Jie', 'Guo, Yuxia']","['Guan X', 'Wen X', 'Xiao J', 'An X', 'Yu J', 'Guo Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0014-6862'],"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors', 'THP-1 Cells', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12952 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Apr;41(2):234-241. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12952.

Treatment options include low-dose aspirin and cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea. In cases of extreme thrombocytosis, therapeutic thrombocytapheresis can be a useful procedure. We present a case of a 61-year-old-man previously diagnosed with CALR-mutated ET, who develop acute myeloid leukemia. When recovering after induction chemotherapy, he developed an extreme thrombocytosis up to 2337 x 10(9) /L regardless hydroxyurea was started. Two therapeutic trombocytapheresis were performed and anagrelide was added to cytoreductive regimen. Platelet count stabilized around 570 x 10(9) /L. Both procedures were performed with the Spectra Optia Apheresis System version 11.3 (Terumo BCT) and we decided to use a higher collection preference and lower collection speed than manufacturer's recommendations. Platelet count decreased from 2380 x 10(9) /L to 1035 x 10(9) /L in the first procedure and from 1813 x 10(9) /L to 768 x 10(9) in the second procedure. Platelet collection efficiency was calculated to be 110.3% and 86.1% in the first and second thrombocytapheresis, respectively. Therapeutic thrombocytapheresis with Spectra Optia is a safe and efficient therapy to treat patients with primary thrombocytosis while effect of cytoreductive agents is attained. Platelet collection efficiency was calculated to be higher than previously reported. We suggest that changes in technical parameters such as a deeper aspiration point and/or lower collection speed may increase procedure's efficiency.","['Almeida-Dias, Raquel', 'Garrote, Marta', 'Cid, Joan', 'Mustieles, Maria-Jesus', 'Alba, Cristina', 'Lozano, Miquel']","['Almeida-Dias R', 'Garrote M', 'Cid J', 'Mustieles MJ', 'Alba C', 'Lozano M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5445-4508', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2593-833X']","['Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Immuno-Hemotherapy, Hospital de Braga, Braga, Portugal.', 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hematology and Oncology Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,,IM,"['Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Plateletpheresis/*methods', 'Thrombocytosis/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21683 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2019 Aug;34(4):503-506. doi: 10.1002/jca.21683.

However, little is known about contributions of genetic variation to their efficacy and safety. Multiple pathways link catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to the vitamin E supplement, alpha-tocopherol, and cancer. METHODS: Here we determined if COMT exerted pharmacogenetic effects on cancer prevention in two randomized trials of alpha-tocopherol supplementation. Pharmacogenetic effects of common COMT rs4680 (val158met), which encodes a nonsynonymous valine-to-methionine substitution, were examined in the trial plus a 10-year post-trial follow-up (overall) period of The Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS, N = 23 294), a 10-year alpha-tocopherol and aspirin trial with 10 years post-trial follow-up. Results were validated in a case/control (N = 2396/2235) subset of the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC, N = 29 133). The primary outcome was total cancers. Rates of cancer types prevalent in women (colorectal, breast, lung, uterine, and lymphoma/leukemia) were also examined. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analysis of rs4680 genotype strata, in WGHS and ATBC overall periods, revealed differential alpha-tocopherol effects compared with placebo: met/met (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80 to 0.97; P = .01), val/met (HR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.06; P = .74), and val/val (HR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.31; P = .002) with a statistically significant COMT by alpha-tocopherol interaction (Pinteraction <.001). Timing of effects differed, with stronger effects in WGHS trial and ATBC post-trial. CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic analysis of COMT and cancer prevention in two large randomized trials revealed statistically significant COMT by alpha-tocopherol interaction, such that alpha-tocopherol was beneficial among rs4680 met-allele (28.0%), but not val-allele (22.8%) homozygotes. These effects indicate the need for additional studies of genetic variation as a determinant of the benefits and possible harms of over-the-counter supplements, like alpha-tocopherol, used for health promotion.","['Hall, Kathryn T', 'Buring, Julie E', 'Mukamal, Kenneth J', 'Vinayaga Moorthy, M', 'Wayne, Peter M', 'Kaptchuk, Ted J', 'Battinelli, Elisabeth M', 'Ridker, Paul M', 'Sesso, Howard D', 'Weinstein, Stephanie J', 'Albanes, Demetrius', 'Cook, Nancy R', 'Chasman, Daniel I']","['Hall KT', 'Buring JE', 'Mukamal KJ', 'Vinayaga Moorthy M', 'Wayne PM', 'Kaptchuk TJ', 'Battinelli EM', 'Ridker PM', 'Sesso HD', 'Weinstein SJ', 'Albanes D', 'Cook NR', 'Chasman DI']",,"[""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.', ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.', ""Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Divisions of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['K01 HL130625/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AT009282/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA182913/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201500005C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', 'EC 2.1.1.6 (COMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.6 (Catechol O-Methyltransferase)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Dietary Supplements/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diet therapy/*genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'alpha-Tocopherol/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'beta Carotene/therapeutic use']",PMC6624170,,2019/01/10 06:00,2020/07/09 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['5260812 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djy204 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Jul 1;111(7):684-694. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djy204.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Unfortunately, leukemia recurrence is the main cause of transplant failure. Risk factors for relapse include presence of minimal residual disease and a variety of well-recognized leukemia prognostic factors. Posttransplant therapy could decrease the risk of leukemia relapse and is under investigation. In this review, we summarize the current research in maintenance therapy for the prevention of acute leukemia recurrence after allogeneic transplant. RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenetic modifiers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates are among potential maintenance therapies given their side-effect profile and many are currently under investigation. In the posttransplant setting, the phase I/II data are maturing and have been encouraging enough to lead to the initiation of multicenter phase III randomized clinical trials. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no standard of care for posttransplant maintenance for acute leukemias. Further investigation into the efficacy and safety of posttransplant maintenance is warranted given phase I/II clinical trials results. Beyond chemo-immunotherapy, the use of targeted cellular therapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, is a potential therapy as well.","['Poudel, Shyam K', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Metheny, Leland']","['Poudel SK', 'de Lima M', 'Metheny L']",,"['Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000484 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):96-111. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000484.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the existing technologies are either of insufficient resolution, or unable to provide precise information on the localization of individual proteins. Here, we report a new method that combines the use of quantum dot labeling, super-resolution microscopy (structured illumination microscopy, SIM) and software modeling. In this proof-of-principle study, we assessed the biological effects of Bestatin on individual cells from different AML cell lines expressing CD13 proteins, a potential target for tumor targeted therapy. Using the proposed method, we found that the different AML cell lines exhibit different CD13 expression densities, ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 molecules per mum2 cell surface, respectively. Importantly, Bestatin treatment assays shows that its effects on cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle change are directly proportional to the density of CD13 on the cell surface of these cell lines. The results suggest that the proposed method advances the quantitative analysis of single cell surface proteins, and that the quantitative profiling information of the target protein on single cells has potential value in targeted drug susceptibility assessment.","['Xi, Yan', 'Wang, Dianbing', 'Wang, Tingting', 'Huang, Lin', 'Zhang, Xian-En']","['Xi Y', 'Wang D', 'Wang T', 'Huang L', 'Zhang XE']",,"['Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,"['Antibodies/chemistry/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD13 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Quantum Dots/chemistry']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8nr06526h [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2019 Jan 23;11(4):1737-1744. doi: 10.1039/c8nr06526h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were categorized as having myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities accounted for 57.4% (345/601) of the patients under the 2016 WHO classification. AML with mutated NPM1 was the most common form (16.5%), with the majority associated with monocytic differentiation (63.6%). AML with double CEBPA mutations accounted for 8.3% of these cases, and the majority were previously diagnosed as AML with/without maturation (78.0%). These newly classified mutations were mutually exclusive without overlapping with other forms of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities. AML with mutated NPM1 and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes comprised the oldest patients, whereas AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 included the youngest patients. The leukocyte count was highest in AML with mutated NPM1, and the percentage of peripheral blood blasts was the highest in AML with double CEBPA mutations. Our results indicate that implementation of the 2016 WHO classification of AML would not pose major difficulties in clinical practice. Hematopathologists should review and prepare genetic tests for the new classification, according to their clinical laboratory conditions.","['Jung, Jin', 'Cho, Byung Sik', 'Kim, Hee Je', 'Han, Eunhee', 'Jang, Woori', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nack Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Kim, Yonggoo']","['Jung J', 'Cho BS', 'Kim HJ', 'Han E', 'Jang W', 'Han K', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim M', 'Kim Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8632-0168', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2808-3795']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. microkim@catholic.ac.kr."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. yonggoo@catholic.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],['HI18C0480/Ministry of Health and Welfare'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1-IT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'World Health Organization']",PMC6340847,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['39.311 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2019.39.3.311 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2019 May;39(3):311-316. doi: 10.3343/alm.2019.39.3.311.,['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['2016 WHO classification', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA', 'NPM1']",,,,,['No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: In this multicenter Dutch-Belgian protocol (DB AML-01), 112 children with de novo AML were included. Treatment was stratified according to day 15 bone marrow response after the first induction course. Poor responders received a second course without delay while good responders awaited hematological recovery. Patients achieving CR after two induction courses continued with three consolidation courses without HSCT in CR1. RESULTS: The overall remission rate was 93.5%. After a median follow-up of 4.1 years, three-year event-free survival (EFS) was 52.6% (95% CI, 42.9%-61.3%), three-year cumulative incidence of relapse 39.7% (95% CI, 30.1%-49.0%), and three-year overall survival (OS) 74.0% (95% CI, 64.8%-81.2%). Significantly more events occurred in patients with high WBC at diagnosis or FLT3-ITD/NPM1-WT, whereas core binding factor (CBF) leukemia had a significantly better EFS. KMT2A rearrangements and age > 10 years negatively impacted OS. CONCLUSIONS: DB AML-01 response-guided therapy results in a favorable OS, particularly for children with CBF leukemia, children younger than 10 years or with initial WBC counts below 100 x 10(9) /L. Outcome of patients with FLT3-ITD/NPM1-WT remains poor and warrants alternative treatment strategies.","['De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Reedijk, Ardine', 'de Bock, Geertruida H', 'Lammens, Tim', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Denys, Barbara', 'Dedeken, Laurence', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Te Loo, Maroeska', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Van Damme, An', 'Van der Werff-Ten Bosch, Jutte', 'Zsiros, Jozsef', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'de Bont, Eveline']","['De Moerloose B', 'Reedijk A', 'de Bock GH', 'Lammens T', 'de Haas V', 'Denys B', 'Dedeken L', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Te Loo M', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Van Damme A', 'Van der Werff-Ten Bosch J', 'Zsiros J', 'Kaspers G', 'de Bont E']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2449-539X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8733-4027']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Princess Maxima Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam Medical Center, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Princess Maxima Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27605 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 May;66(5):e27605. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27605.

We have previously reported that an increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor CD126 leads to resistance of CLL cells to chemotherapy and worse prognosis for patients with CLL. In this study, we determine whether autocrine IL-6 production by CLL B cells is associated with poor clinical outcome and explore IL-6-mediated survival mechanism in primary CLL cells. Our results demonstrate that higher levels of autocrine IL-6 are significantly associated with shorter absolute lymphocyte doubling time, patients received treatment, without complete remission, advanced Binet stages, 17p/11q deletion, and shorter time to first time treatment and progression-free survival. IL-6 activated both STAT3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in primary CLL cells. Blocking IL-6 receptor and JAK2 inhibited IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3 and NF-kappaB. Our study demonstrates that an increased autocrine IL-6 production by CLL B-cells are associated with worse clinical outcome for patients with CLL. IL-6 promotes CLL cell survival by activating both STAT3 and NF-kappaB through diverse signaling cascades. Neutralizing IL-6 or blocking IL-6 receptor might contribute overcoming the resistance of CLL cells to chemotherapy. We propose that the measurement of autocrine IL-6 could be a useful approach to predict clinical outcome.","['Wang, Hua-Qing', 'Jia, Li', 'Li, Yu-Ting', 'Farren, Timothy', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Liu, Feng-Ting']","['Wang HQ', 'Jia L', 'Li YT', 'Farren T', 'Agrawal SG', 'Liu FT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6076-8455', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0332-257X']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tianjin Union Medial Center of Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", 'Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Haemato-Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust and Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tianjin Union Medial Center of Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', ""Division of Haemato-Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust and Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6590298,,2019/01/10 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28086 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):13994-14006. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28086.

In this study, we demonstrated that Nrf2 inhibition is an additional mechanism responsible for the marked antileukemic activity in AML seen with the combination of HMAs and venetoclax (ABT-199). HMA and venetoclax combined treatment augmented mitochondrial ROS induction and apoptosis compared with treatment HMA alone. Treatment of AML cell lines as well as primary AML cells with venetoclax disrupted HMA decitabine-increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induction of downstream antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 and NADP-quinone oxidoreductase-1. Venetoclax treatment also leads to dissociation of B-cell lymphoma 2 from the Nrf2/Keap-1 complex and targets Nrf2 to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, our results here demonstrated an undiscovered mechanism underlying synergistic effect of decitabine and venetoclax in AML cells, elucidating for impressive results in antileukemic activity against AML in preclinical and early clinical studies by combined treatment of these drugs.","['Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong', 'Troadec, Estelle', 'Kalvala, Arjun', 'Kumar, Bijender', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa',

Making this treatment available to our patients prompted us to develop a novel CART19 based on our own anti-CD19 antibody (A3B1), followed by CD8 hinge and transmembrane region, 4-1BB- and CD3z-signaling domains. We show that A3B1 CAR T cells are highly cytotoxic and specific against CD19+ cells in vitro, inducing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CAR T cell proliferation. In vivo, A3B1 CAR T cells are able to fully control disease progression in an NOD.Cg-Prkdc (scid) Il2rd (tm1Wjl) /SzJ (NSG) xenograph B-ALL mouse model. Based on the pre-clinical data, we conclude that our CART19 is clearly functional against CD19+ cells, to a level similar to other CAR19s currently being used in the clinic. Concurrently, we describe the implementation of our CAR T cell production system, using lentiviral vector and CliniMACS Prodigy, within a medium-sized academic institution. The results of the validation phase show our system is robust and reproducible, while maintaining a low cost that is affordable for academic institutions. Our model can serve as a paradigm for similar institutions, and it may help to make CAR T cell treatment available to all patients.","['Castella, Maria', 'Boronat, Anna', 'Martin-Ibanez, Raquel', 'Rodriguez, Vanina', 'Sune, Guillermo', 'Caballero, Miguel', 'Marzal, Berta', 'Perez-Amill, Lorena', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz', 'Castano, Julio', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Balague, Olga', 'Gonzalez-Navarro, Europa Azucena', 'Serra-Pages, Carles', 'Engel, Pablo', 'Vilella, Ramon', 'Benitez-Ribas, Daniel', 'Ortiz-Maldonado, Valentin', 'Cid, Joan', 'Tabera, Jaime', 'Canals, Josep M', 'Lozano, Miquel', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Vilarrodona, Anna', 'Trias, Esteve', 'Campo, Elias', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Yague, Jordi', 'Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Rives, Susana', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Juan, Manel']","['Castella M', 'Boronat A', 'Martin-Ibanez R', 'Rodriguez V', 'Sune G', 'Caballero M', 'Marzal B', 'Perez-Amill L', 'Martin-Antonio B', 'Castano J', 'Bueno C', 'Balague O', 'Gonzalez-Navarro EA', 'Serra-Pages C', 'Engel P', 'Vilella R', 'Benitez-Ribas D', 'Ortiz-Maldonado V', 'Cid J', 'Tabera J', 'Canals JM', 'Lozano M', 'Baumann T', 'Vilarrodona A', 'Trias E', 'Campo E', 'Menendez P', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Yague J', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Rives S', 'Delgado J', 'Juan M']",,"['Department of Hematology, ICMHO, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Villarroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer -

Iljin. is an endemic plant species, which is important in Siberian medicine. It possesses adaptogenic properties and has been used for treatment of overstrain and weakness after illness, physical weakness, and mental weariness. The roots of this species obtained after Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation are rich in caffeoylquinic acid derivatives known as strong antioxidant compounds. The study makes the first evaluation of the cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of transformed root extract (Rc TR extract) in various human cancer cell lines: leukemia cells (K-562 and CCRF-CEM) and lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549). It was found that Rc TR extract inhibited the cell viability of all tested cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, and leukemia cell lines were more sensitive to plant extract than A549 lung cancer cell line. Additionally, the Rc TR extract reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and demonstrated genotoxicity against tested cell lines by increasing mitochondrial DNA lesions in ND1 and ND5 genes and causing nuclear DNA damage in TP53 gene. Our results show that Rc TR extract may effectively treat cancer cells by inducing dysfunction of mitochondria. Additionally, the role of mtDNA may be a promising factor in chemotherapy, and it needs further studies.","['Skala, Ewa', 'Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Kowalczyk, Tomasz', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Sitarek, Przemyslaw']","['Skala E', 'Synowiec E', 'Kowalczyk T', 'Sliwinski T', 'Sitarek P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1139-6840', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0730-4491', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5495-3550']","['Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Genetics, Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma of Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leuzea/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Plant Roots/*chemistry']",PMC6304841,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/8198652 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2018 Dec 9;2018:8198652. doi: 10.1155/2018/8198652. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design: The bibliographic research was made on the major scientific databases. Analysis included only articles written in English and published on peer-reviewed scientific journals describing preclinical experiments and clinical trials carried out to investigate the antianxiety effects of Citrus aurantium or Citrus sinensis EOs on anxiety disorders. Clinical studies reporting the antianxiety effects of products containing Citrus aurantium or Citrus sinensis EOs in combination with other active substances, including medicinal plants, were excluded. Nine clinical studies fulfilled the criteria adopted for analysis. Results: Data show that Citrus aurantium or Citrus sinensis EOs produce anxiolytic effects both in preclinical experiments and in different clinical conditions. Citrus aurantium EO aromatherapy reduced anxiety level in the great part of stress conditions studied (subjects affected by chronic myeloid leukemia and preoperative patients) except for a sample of patients subjected to colonoscopy. Exposition to Citrus sinensis EO in clinical studies shows to be positive in reducing anxiety level in patients waiting for dental treatment as well as in healthy volunteers submitted to an anxiogenic situation. Conclusions: Overview of clinical trials conducted with Citrus aurantium or Citrus sinensis on people with anxiety showed that inhalation or oral administration of Citrus aurantium and inhalation of Citrus sinensis can exert beneficial effects on anxiety; however, because of incomplete accuracy in the reporting of methodology, further more complete clinical studies are warranted.","['Mannucci, Carmen', 'Calapai, Fabrizio', 'Cardia, Luigi', 'Inferrera, Giuseppina', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Di Pietro, Martina', 'Navarra, Michele', 'Gangemi, Sebastiano', 'Ventura Spagnolo, Elvira', 'Calapai, Gioacchino']","['Mannucci C', 'Calapai F', 'Cardia L', 'Inferrera G', ""D'Arena G"", 'Di Pietro M', 'Navarra M', 'Gangemi S', 'Ventura Spagnolo E', 'Calapai G']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1292-6284', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3807-7287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6492-7820', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7001-6532', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8116-4821']","['Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Anesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain Therapy, A.O.U.

However, the same alloreactive T cells also mediate a severe side effect, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and prevention of GVHD while preserving GVL activity remains an elusive goal. The immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and its interaction with PD-1 receptor in regulating cancer immunity is under intensive and wide-spread study, but knowledge about this interaction in regulating GVHD and GVL activity is very limited. In this review, we summarize the literature exploring how PD-L1 interaction with its receptors PD-1 and CD80 regulate GVHD and GVL activities, how PD-L1 signaling regulates T cell metabolic profiles, and how a differential role of PD-L1 interaction with PD-1, CD80 or both may provide a novel avenue to prevent GVHD while preserving strong GVL effects.","['Cassady, Kaniel', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Zeng, Defu']","['Cassady K', 'Martin PJ', 'Zeng D']",,"['Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI066008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA228465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6308317,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03061 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 21;9:3061. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03061. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD80', '*GVHD', '*HCT', '*PD-1', '*PD-L1', '*T cell', '*alloreactive']",,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ChMAP-28 has the amino acid sequence GRFKRFRKKLKRLWHKVGPFVGPILHY and is homologous to other alpha-helical mammalian antimicrobial peptides. ChMAP-28 shows considerably higher cytotoxicity against cultured tumor cells than toward normal cells at concentrations of <10 muM. Our findings suggest that ChMAP-28 can initiate necrotic death of cancer cells. Its cytotoxic effect is accomplished due to disruption of the plasma membrane integrity and is not abrogated by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. ChMAP-28 causes permeabilization of cytoplasmic membrane of human leukemia cells HL-60 already after 15 min of incubation. Here, we show that ChMAP-28 has one of the highest antitumor activity in vitro among all known antimicrobial peptides. We speculate that the observed specificity of ChMAP-28 cytotoxic effect against tumor cells is due to its relatively low hydrophobicity and high cationicity. In the meantime, this peptide has low hemolytic activity, which generates a potential for its use as a therapeutic agent.","['Emelianova, Anna A', 'Kuzmin, Denis V', 'Panteleev, Pavel V', 'Sorokin, Maxim', 'Buzdin, Anton A', 'Ovchinnikova, Tatiana V']","['Emelianova AA', 'Kuzmin DV', 'Panteleev PV', 'Sorokin M', 'Buzdin AA', 'Ovchinnikova TV']",,"['M.

Recently, T cell immunotherapy studies have mainly focused on chimeric antigen receptor- and T cell receptor-engineered T cells. Clinical trials involving chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells have been a major breakthrough and became a novel therapy for leukemia.

Multiple 5' fusion partners for TFE3 have been reported, including ASPSCR1, CLTC, DVL2, LUC7L3, KHSRP, PRCC, PARP14, NONO, SFPQ1, MED15, and RBM10. Each of these fusion genes activates TFE3 transcription which can be detected by immunostaining. Using targeted RNA-sequencing, TFE3 fusion gene partners were identified in 5 cases of TFE3 immunohistochemistry positive translocation renal cell carcinoma. Three cases demonstrated known fusions: ASPSCR1-TFE3, MED15-TFE3 and RBM10-TFE3. However, two cases showed unreported NEAT1-TFE3 and KAT6A-TFE3 fusion transcripts. The NEAT1-TFE3 RCC arose in a 59-year-old male; which demonstrated overlapping morphological features seen in NEAT2(MALAT1)-TFEB t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma, including biphasic alveolar/nested tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. The KAT6A-TFE3 renal cell carcinoma demonstrated typical morphological features of TFE3/Xp11 renal cell carcinoma including papillae, eosinophilic cytoplasm with focal clearing and abundant psammoma bodies. KAT6A gene fusion was reported in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia, which has not been previously reported in solid tumors. This report highlights the genetic complexity of TFE3 translocation renal cell carcinoma; and RNA-sequencing is a powerful approach for elucidating the underlying genetic alterations.","['Pei, Jianming', 'Cooper, Harry', 'Flieder, Douglas B', 'Talarchek, Jacqueline N', 'Al-Saleem, Tahseen', 'Uzzo, Robert G', 'Dulaimi, Essel', 'Patchefsky, Arthur S', 'Testa, Joseph R', 'Wei, Shuanzeng']","['Pei J', 'Cooper H', 'Flieder DB', 'Talarchek JN', 'Al-Saleem T', 'Uzzo RG', 'Dulaimi E', 'Patchefsky AS', 'Testa JR', 'Wei S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1301-5175'],"['Genomics Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Genomics Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Genomics Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA. weishuanzeng@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NEAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TFE3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6486435,['NIHMS1512058'],2019/01/10 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-018-0191-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-018-0191-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2019 May;32(5):710-716. doi: 10.1038/s41379-018-0191-7.

Here, we uncover that JMJD1C, a jumonji C (JmjC)-containing H3K9 demethylase, is a critical regulator of aberrant metabolic processes in homeobox A9 (HOXA9)-dependent acute myeloid leukemia (AML). JMJD1C overexpression increases in vivo cell proliferation and tumorigenicity through demethylase-independent upregulation of a glycolytic and oxidative program, which sustains leukemic cell bioenergetics and contributes to an aggressive AML phenotype in vivo. Targeting JMJD1C-mediated metabolism via pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation led to ATP depletion, induced necrosis/apoptosis and decreased tumor growth in vivo in leukemias co-expressing JMJD1C and HOXA9. The anti-metabolic therapy effectively diminished AML stem/progenitor cells and reduced tumor burden in a primary AML patient-derived xenograft. Our data establish a direct link between drug responses and endogenous expression of JMJD1C and HOXA9 in human AML cell line- and patient-derived xenografts. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for JMJD1C in counteracting adverse metabolic changes and retaining the metabolic integrity during tumorigenesis, which can be exploited therapeutically.","['Lynch, Jennifer R', 'Salik, Basit', 'Connerty, Patrick', 'Vick, Binje', 'Leung, Halina', 'Pijning, Aster', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Trahair, Toby', 'Liu, Tao',

The recognition that erythropoietin receptors (EPORs) are expressed outside the erythroid lineage and concerns that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may cause tumors to grow and increase the risk of venous thromboembolism have resulted in substantially fewer cancer patients receiving ESA therapy to manage myelosuppressive chemotherapy. In this study, we found that EPO suppresses p53-dependent apoptosis induced by genotoxic (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and gamma-radiation) and non-genotoxic (nutlin-3a) agents and induces a senescence-like state in myeloid leukemia cells. EPO interferes with stress-dependent Mdm2 downregulation and leads to the destabilization of p53 protein. EPO selectively modulates the expression of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage preventing the induction of a number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) previously associated with p53-dependent apoptosis. EPO also enhances the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1) and promotes recruitment of p53 to the p21 promoter. In addition, EPO antagonizes Mcl-1 protein degradation in daunorubicin-treated cells. Hence, EPO signaling targets Mcl-1 expression and the p53-Mdm2 network to promote tumor cell survival.","['Pham, Thuc-Nghi Duc', 'Ma, Weili', 'Miller, David', 'Kazakova, Lidia', 'Benchimol, Samuel']","['Pham TD', 'Ma W', 'Miller D', 'Kazakova L', 'Benchimol S']",,"['Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada. benchimo@yorku.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (EPO protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6325163,,2019/01/10 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-1274-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-1274-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Jan 8;10(1):22. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-1274-6.,,,,,,,,20190108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

InO consists of a CD22-targeting immunoglobulin G4 humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin. Although initially developed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) because of activity in preclinical models and high response rates in indolent lymphomas, a phase 3 trial was negative and further development focused on CD22(+) ALL. Although results in NHL were disappointing, parallel testing in early-phase trials of CD22(+) ALL demonstrated feasibility and efficacy. Subsequently, the randomized phase 3 Study Of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Versus Investigator's Choice Of Chemotherapy In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia trial showed that InO was superior to standard of care regimens with a significantly improved complete remission (CR) rate in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (80.7% vs 29.4%, P < .001). Patients achieving CR with InO also had a significantly higher rate of undetectable minimal residual disease compared with chemotherapy (78.4% vs 28.1%, P < .001). InO-specific side effects, including veno-occlusive disease, have been an ongoing area of concern, and consensus guidelines for minimizing toxicities are now available. Ongoing trials are investigating the combination of InO with other agents in the relapse setting and the addition of InO to frontline therapy.

CAR-expressing T cells against CD19 can cause curative effects in leukemia and lymphoma and is approved for clinical use. However, no CAR-T therapy is currently approved for use in solid tumors. We hypothesize that the resistance of solid tumors to CAR-T can be overcome by similar means as those used to reactivate tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL), for example, by cytokines or immune checkpoint blockade. Here we demonstrate that CAR-T cells directed against HER2 can kill uveal and cutaneous melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Curative effects in vivo were only observed in xenografts grown in a NOD/SCID IL2 receptor gamma (NOG) knockout mouse strain transgenic for human IL2. The effect was target-specific, as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of HER2 in the melanoma cells abrogated the killing effect of the CAR-T cells. The CAR-T cells were also able to kill melanoma cells from patients resistant to adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT) of autologous TILs. Thus, CAR-T therapy represents an option for patients that do not respond to immunotherapy with ACT of TIL or immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, our data highlight the use of IL2 transgenic NOG mice as models to prove efficacy of CAR-T-cell products, possibly even in a personalized manner. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that a novel humanized mouse model can help clinical translation of CAR-T cells against uveal and cutaneous melanoma that do not respond to TIL therapy or immune checkpoint blockade.","['Forsberg, Elin M V', 'Lindberg, Mattias F', 'Jespersen, Henrik', 'Alsen, Samuel', 'Bagge, Roger Olofsson', 'Donia, Marco', 'Svane, Inge Marie', 'Nilsson, Ola', 'Ny, Lars', 'Nilsson, Lisa M', 'Nilsson, Jonas A']","['Forsberg EMV', 'Lindberg MF', 'Jespersen H', 'Alsen S', 'Bagge RO', 'Donia M', 'Svane IM', 'Nilsson O', 'Ny L', 'Nilsson LM', 'Nilsson JA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4196-3060', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6543-5369', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5795-0355']","['The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Center of Cancer Immunotherapy, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'The Center of Cancer Immunotherapy, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'The Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. jonas.a.nilsson@surgery.gu.se.', 'Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant', 'Uveal melanoma']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/transplantation', 'Melanoma/enzymology/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*immunology/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/enzymology/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Uveal Neoplasms/enzymology/immunology/*therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-3158 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3158 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Mar 1;79(5):899-904. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3158.

High concentrations of nitrite can threat human health since several studies in the literature claim that nitrite is associated with cancer incidences, leukemia, and brain tumors. Therefore, it is vital to measure the nitrite concentrations in processed meat products. In this study, an in-lab miniaturized photometric detection system is fabricated to inspect the nitrite concentration in processed meat products in Jordan. The analytical performance of nitrite detection is evaluated based on three key statistical parameters; linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation. Respectively, for the fabricated system, the three values are found to be equal to 0.995, 1.24 x 10(-2) ppm, and 4.12 x 10(-2) ppm. Adherence to Beer's law is found over the investigated range from 2.63 ppm to 96.0 ppm. The developed system is utilized for photometric detection of nitrite in processed meat products available in the Jordanian market like pastrami, salami, and corned beef. In all of the analyzed samples, the nitrite content is found to be lower than 150 ppm, which represents the maximum allowable nitrite limit.","['Khanfar, Mohammad F', 'Abu Eisheh, Nour J', 'Al-Ghussain, Loiy', ""Al-Halhouli, Ala'aldeen T""]","['Khanfar MF', 'Abu Eisheh NJ', 'Al-Ghussain L', 'Al-Halhouli AT']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0062-9274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3457-3806']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Engineering, School of Applied Medical Sciences, German Jordanian University, Amman 11180, Jordan.

GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) mutations cause GATA-2 deficiency syndrome involving immunodeficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. GATA-2 physiological activities necessitate that it be strictly regulated, and cell type-specific enhancers fulfill this role. The +9.5 intronic enhancer harbors multiple conserved cis-elements, and germline mutations of these cis-elements are pathogenic in humans. Since mechanisms underlying how GATA2 enhancer disease mutations impact hematopoiesis and pathology are unclear, we generated mouse models of the enhancer mutations. While a multi-motif mutant was embryonically lethal, a single-nucleotide Ets motif mutant was viable, and steady-state hematopoiesis was normal. However, the Ets motif mutation abrogated stem/progenitor cell regeneration following stress. These results reveal a new mechanism in human genetics, in which a disease predisposition mutation inactivates enhancer regenerative activity, while sparing developmental activity. Mutational sensitization to stress that instigates hematopoietic failure constitutes a paradigm for GATA-2 deficiency syndrome and other contexts of GATA-2-dependent pathogenesis.","['Soukup, Alexandra A', 'Zheng, Ye', 'Mehta, Charu', 'Wu, Jun', 'Liu, Peng', 'Cao, Miao', 'Hofmann, Inga', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Choi, Kyunghee', 'Keles, Sunduz', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Soukup AA', 'Zheng Y', 'Mehta C', 'Wu J', 'Liu P', 'Cao M', 'Hofmann I', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang J', 'Johnson KD', 'Choi K', 'Keles S', 'Bresnick EH']",,"['UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, and.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL007899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL055337/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*GATA2 Deficiency/genetics/metabolism', '*GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', '*Nucleotide Motifs', 'Regeneration/*genetics']",PMC6391105,,2019/01/09 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['122694 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI122694 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Mar 1;129(3):1180-1192. doi: 10.1172/JCI122694.

The four major types of leukemia are acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinical manifestations are due to either bone marrow suppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia) or leukemic organ infiltration. Imaging manifestations of leukemia in the thorax are myriad. While lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation of intrathoracic leukemia, leukemia may also involve the lungs, pleura, heart, and bones and soft tissues.

METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 912 AML patients >/=45 years of age who had undergone haplo-SCT with either myeloablative conditioning (MAC; n = 373) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC; n = 539) regimens. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 31.1 and 25.7 months for MAC and RIC, respectively. The incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 25.1% versus 28.7% and 31.0% versus 30.3% for MAC and RIC, respectively; 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 43.9% for MAC versus 41.0% for RIC. In multivariate analysis, the use of MAC versus RIC was not associated with a difference in the outcomes. Results were confirmed in the propensity score-weighted analysis. Disease status and performance status at transplantation were associated with outcomes. Notably, the use of posttransplantation cyclophosphamide was associated with reduced acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) stage III-IV, and NRM and increased overall survival, LFS, and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival. The use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells was associated with an increased risk of stage II-IV aGVHD. CONCLUSION: No differences were found between MAC and RIC regimens for haplo-SCT in adults with AML who were >/=45 years of age. The type of GVHD prophylaxis, disease status, and performance status were the major predictors of transplantation outcome. These results may serve as the background for randomized study comparing RIC versus MAC for haplo-SCT in adults with AML.","['Santoro, Nicole', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Nasso, Daniela', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Arcese, William', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Koc, Yener', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Santoro N', 'Labopin M', 'Ciceri F', 'Van Lint MT', 'Nasso D', 'Blaise D', 'Arcese W', 'Tischer J', 'Bruno B', 'Ehninger G', 'Koc Y', 'Santarone S', 'Huang XJ', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5705-8084', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1906-5819', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3304-9965', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7261-2765']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Centro Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'ALWP Office, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Martino Hospital, Department of Haematology II, Genova, Italy.', 'Rome Transplant Network, Tor Vergata, University of Rome, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Cancer Research Center, Institute Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Rome Transplant Network, Tor Vergata, University of Rome, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'University Hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, LMU, Department of Internal Medicine III, Munich, Germany.', 'S.S.C.V.D Trapianto di Cellule Staminali, A.O.U Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Presidio Molinette, Torino, Italy.', 'Universitaets Klinikum Dresden, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Park Hospitals, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Ospedale Civile, Dipartimento di Ematologia, Medicina Trasfusionale e Biotecnologie, Pescara, Italy.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Institute of Haematology, Beijing, China."", 'ALWP Office, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'ALWP Office, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party of EBMT.', 'ALWP Office, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31941 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 May 1;125(9):1499-1506. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31941.

This article is a review of the current guidelines, recommendations, and expert panel consensus of a number of associations and conferences on the prevention and management of IC and candidemia in both pediatric and neonatal patients. The investigated resources included the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the European Conference on Infection in Leukaemia, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the German Speaking Mycological Society/Paul-Ehrlich Society for Chemotherapy, as well as the Canadian, Middle Eastern, and Australian guidelines. Echinocandins and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) are the first-line agents in the treatment of IC and candidemia both for immunocompetent and immunocompromised pediatric patients. The recommendations suggested to keep patients under sterile conditions for at least 14 days after blood cultures as the prompt initiation of antifungal treatment.

In the past two decades, the establishment of haploidentical transplant modalities make ""everyone has a donor"" become a reality. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse remain the major two causes of death either in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched transplant or haploidentical transplant settings, both of which restrict the improvement of transplant outcomes. Preclinical mice model showed that both donor-derived T cells and natural killer (NK) cells play important role in the pathogenesis of GVHD and the effects of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Hence, understanding the immune mechanisms of GVHD and GVL would provide potential strategies for the control of leukemia relapse without aggravating GVHD. The purpose of the current review is to summarize the biology of GVHD and GVL responses in preclinical models and to discuss potential novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the relapse rate after allo-SCT. We will also review the approaches, including optimal donor selection and, conditioning regimens, donor lymphocyte infusion, BCR/ABL-specific CTL, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells, which have been successfully used in the clinic to enhance and preserve anti-leukemia activity, especially GVL effects, without aggravating GVHD or alleviate GVHD.","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Chang YJ', 'Zhao XY', 'Huang XJ']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Allografts/drug effects/immunology', 'Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Donor Selection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/prevention & control', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",PMC6308132,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03041 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 21;9:3041. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03041. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*G-CSF', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*relapse']",,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, donor CD4 T-cells after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may mediate graft-vs.-leukemia reactivity without graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). We analyzed immune responses in four patients converting from mixed to full donor chimerism without developing GVHD upon purified CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from their HLA-identical sibling donor after T-cell depleted alloSCT. In vivo activated T-cells were clonally isolated after CD4 DLI. Of the alloreactive T-cell clones, 96% were CD4 positive, illustrating the dominant role of CD4 T-cells in the immune responses. We identified 9 minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) as targets for alloreactivity, of which 8 were novel HLA class II restricted MiHA. In all patients, MiHA specific CD4 T-cells were found that were capable to lyse hematopoietic cells and to recognize normal and malignant cells. No GVHD was induced in these patients. Skin fibroblasts forced to express HLA class II, were recognized by only two MiHA specific CD4 T-cell clones. Of the 7 clones that failed to recognize fibroblasts, two targeted MiHA were encoded by genes not expressed in fibroblasts, presentation of one MiHA was dependent on HLA-DO, which is absent in fibroblasts, and T-cells recognizing the remaining 4 MiHA had an avidity that was apparently too low to recognize fibroblasts, despite clear recognition of hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, purified CD4 DLI from HLA-identical sibling donors can induce conversion from mixed to full donor chimerism with graft-vs.-malignancy reactivity, but without GVHD, by targeting HLA class II restricted MiHA.","['van Balen, Peter', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'de Klerk, Wendy', 'van Egmond, Esther H M', 'Veld, Sabrina A J', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Zwaginga, Jaap-Jan', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['van Balen P', 'van Bergen CAM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SAP', 'de Klerk W', 'van Egmond EHM', 'Veld SAJ', 'Halkes CJM', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Griffioen M', 'Jedema I', 'Falkenburg JHF']",,"['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Chimerism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6305328,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03016 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 18;9:3016. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03016. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion', '*HLA class II', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft-vs.-tumor reactivity', '*minor histocompatibility antigen']",,,20181218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in KIR genotyping is increasing because of the importance of these receptors for identifying the best possible donor in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to obtain a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Currently, routine protocols to determine the gene content of the KIR cluster are exclusively performed by PCR-SSO and PCR-SSP. To improve the study of these genes, we developed a multiplex, long-range PCR strategy suitable for simultaneous, high-resolution HLA class I and KIR genotyping by next generation sequencing (NGS). This protocol allows amplification of the 14 KIR genes, 2 KIR pseudogenes, and HLA class I genes, with subsequent sequencing on an Illumina platform. The bioinformatics analysis for KIR genotyping was performed by virtual hybridization of gene-specific probes, and HLA genotyping was done by GenDx NGSengine software. To validate the method reliability, 192 genomic DNA samples previously characterized by PCR-SSO were used. When a specific KIR gene was present, a large number of gene-specific virtual probes were detected, whereas when it was absent, very few or none were found, enabling cutoff establishment. Concordance for both the KIR and HLA assignments as compared with the previous characterization was 100%. In conclusion, the multiplex PCR NGS-based strategy presented could provide an efficient, less costly method for KIR-ligand genotyping by gene presence/absence. Furthermore, allele resolution will be possible when KIR-specific software becomes available.","['Closa, Laia', 'Vidal, Francisco', 'Herrero, Maria J', 'Caro, Jose L']","['Closa L', 'Vidal F', 'Herrero MJ', 'Caro JL']",,"['Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Transfusional Medicine Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Transfusional Medicine Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Congenital Coagulopathy Laboratory, Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Cardiovascular Diseases, Madrid, Spain.', 'Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory, Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Transfusional Medicine Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*genetics/immunology', 'Genotyping Techniques/*methods', 'Haplotypes/genetics/immunology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Software']",PMC6305729,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02991 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 19;9:2991. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02991. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA', '*KIR', '*NGS analysis', '*genotyping', '*next generation sequencing']",,,20181219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell function is markedly impaired in CLL patients, who show a significant dysregulation of the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors. Here, we analyzed the role of the novel inhibitory receptor Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2, also termed LIR-1, LILRB1) in the regulation of NK cells in CLL. Our results show that ILT2 expression was significantly decreased on leukemic cells and increased on NK cells of CLL patients, particularly in those with advanced disease and with bad prognostic features, such as those carrying chromosome del(11q). The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide may regulate the expression of ILT2 and its ligands in CLL since it significantly increased the expression of ILT2 and partially reestablished the expression of its ligands on leukemic cells. Furthermore, lenalidomide significantly increased the activation and proliferation of NK cells, which was strongly enhanced by ILT2 blockade. Combining ILT2 blockade and lenalidomide activated NK cell cytotoxicity resulting in increased elimination of leukemic cells from CLL patients. Overall, we describe herein the role of an inhibitory receptor involved in the suppression of NK cell activity in CLL, which is restored by ILT2 blockade in combination with lenalidomide, suggesting that it may be an interesting therapeutic strategy to be explored in this disease.","['Villa-Alvarez, Monica', 'Sordo-Bahamonde, Christian', 'Lorenzo-Herrero, Seila', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana P', 'Payer, Angel R', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Esther', 'Villa-Alvarez, Maria C', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Villa-Alvarez M', 'Sordo-Bahamonde C', 'Lorenzo-Herrero S', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Payer AR', 'Gonzalez-Garcia E', 'Villa-Alvarez MC', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Gonzalez S']",,"['Department of Functional Biology, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Cabuenes, Gijon, Spain.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Hospital Vital Alvarez Buylla, Mieres, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'University Institute of Oncology (IUOPA), University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (LILRB1 protein, human)', '0 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B1)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Blocking/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B1/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC6297751,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02917 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 11;9:2917. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02917. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-2', '*ILT2', '*NK cells', '*checkpoint', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*lenalidomide']",,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various isotypes of protein kinases C (PKCs) are up-regulated in CML and related with BCR-ABL regulating several signalling pathways that are crucial to malignant cellular transformation. However, it is still unknown whether PKC isotypes play crucial roles in IM resistance. Therefore, we herein used a PKC pan-inhibitor staurosporine (St). To protect normal cells from damage, a proper dose of St was used, at which IM-resistant CML cells were selectively killed in combination with IM but normal cells survived. The IM resistance of CML cells was best reversed by 4 nM St alone, mainly depending on the G2/M phase arrest. Cell cycle-related proteins p21, CDK2, cyclin A and cyclin B were down-regulated. Meanwhile, PKC-alpha was more significantly decreased than other PKC isotypes at this concentration. The PKC-alpha-dependent G2/M phase arrest was induced by down-regulation of CDC23, an important regulator of mitotic progression. Low-dose St also reversed IM resistance in vivo. In conclusion, low-dose St selectively increased the sensitivity of IM-resistant CML to IM by arresting cell cycle in the G2/M phase through PKC-alpha-dependent CDC23 inhibition.","['Ma, Dan', 'Wang, Ping', 'Fang, Qin', 'Yu, Zhengyu', 'Zhou, Zhen', 'He, Zhengchang', 'Wei, Danna', 'Yu, Kunling', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Ma D', 'Wang P', 'Fang Q', 'Yu Z', 'Zhou Z', 'He Z', 'Wei D', 'Yu K', 'Lu T', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J']",,"['a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , China.', 'c Department of Pharmacy , Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , China.', 'c Department of Pharmacy , Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Province Institute of Hematology , Guiyang , China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",101594777,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', '*Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21691401.2018.1490310 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol. 2018;46(sup3):S208-S216. doi: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1490310.

The pX region of HTLV-1 genome encodes an accessory protein p30 that is required for viral persistence and spread in the host. p30 regulates viral gene expression at the transcription level by competing with Tax for p300 binding and at posttranscriptional level by nuclear retention of tax/rex messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, p30 modulates the host cellular environment by binding to various host proteins such as ATM, REGgamma, and PRMT5. However, the low expression levels of p30 has been a major hurdle in studying its structure-function relationship in the context of HTLV-1 pathobiology, which is most likely due to its intrinsically disordered nature. To investigate the unstable nature of p30, flow cytometric analysis of p30-GFP fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli was conducted and bioinformatics analysis of p30 was performed. The bacterial cells were green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive, indicating that p30-GFP was in the soluble fraction. Induction, particularly at higher temperature, reduced the expression of p30-GFP. Moreover, p30-GFP was detected exclusively in insoluble fraction upon cell lysis, suggesting its unstable and disordered nature. The bioinformatics analysis of p30 protein sequence and amino acid content revealed that p30 has highly disordered regions from amino acids 75-155 and 197-241. Furthermore, p30 has regions for macromolecular interactions that could stabilize it and these regions coincide with the unstable regions. Collectively, the study indicates that HTLV-1 p30 is an intrinsically disordered protein.","['Namdev, Priyanka', 'Lyngdoh, Denzelle Lee', 'Dar, Hamid Y', 'Chaurasiya, Shivendra K', 'Srivastava, Rupesh', 'Tripathi, Timir', 'Anupam, Rajaneesh']","['Namdev P', 'Lyngdoh DL', 'Dar HY', 'Chaurasiya SK', 'Srivastava R', 'Tripathi T', 'Anupam R']",,"['1 Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, India.', '2 Molecular and Structural Biophysics Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, India.', '3 Department of Zoology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, India.', '4 Host-Pathogen Interaction and Signal Transduction Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, India.', '3 Department of Zoology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, India.', '2 Molecular and Structural Biophysics Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, India.', '1 Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['*Computational Biology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Core Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/AID.2018.0196 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2019 May;35(5):477-487. doi: 10.1089/AID.2018.0196.

In the present, we investigated the anti-leukemia activity of genistein on HL-60 cells in vitro. The percentage of viable cell, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and Ca(2+) production and the level of DeltaPsim were measured by flow cytometric assay. Cell apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated protein expressions were examined by Western blotting assay. Calpain 1, GRP78, and GADD153 expression were measured by confocal laser microscopy. Results indicated that genistein-induced cell morphological changes, decreased the total viable cells, induced G2 /M phase arrest and DNA damage and fragmentation (cell apoptosis) in HL-60 cells. Genistein promoted ROS and Ca(2+) productions and decreased the level of DeltaPsim in HL-60 cells. Western blotting assay demonstrated that genistein increased ER stress-associated protein expression such as IRE-1alpha, Calpain 1, GRP78, GADD153, caspase-7, caspase-4, and ATF-6alpha at 20-50 muM treatment and increased apoptosis associated protein expression such as pro-apoptotic protein Bax, PARP-cleavage, caspase-9, and -3, but decreased anti-apoptotic protein such as Bcl-2 and Bid in HL-60 cells. Calpain 1, GRP78, and GADD153 were increased in HL-60 cells after exposure to 40 muM of genistein. In animal xenografted model, mice were intraperitoneally injected with genistein (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg) for 28 days and the body weight and tumor volume were recorded. Results showed that genistein did not affect the body weights but significantly reduced the tumor weight in 0.4 mg/kg genistein-treated group. Genistein also increased the expressions of ATF-6alpha, GRP78, Bax, Bad, and Bak in tumor. In conclusion, genistein decreased cell number through G2 /M phase arrest and the induction of cell apoptosis through ER stress- and mitochondria-dependent pathways in HL-60 cells and suppressed tumor properties in vivo.","['Hsiao, Yin-Chen', 'Peng, Shu-Fen', 'Lai, Kuang-Chi', 'Liao, Ching-Lung', 'Huang, Yi-Ping', 'Lin, Chin-Chung', 'Lin, Meng-Liang', 'Liu, Kuo-Ching', 'Tsai, Chin-Chuan', 'Ma, Yi-Shih', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Hsiao YC', 'Peng SF', 'Lai KC', 'Liao CL', 'Huang YP', 'Lin CC', 'Lin ML', 'Liu KC', 'Tsai CC', 'Ma YS', 'Chung JG']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7303-2287'],"['Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine and Life Science, Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chinese Medicine, Feng-Yuan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Executive Yuan, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'General Education Center, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Chinese Medicine for Post-Baccalaureate, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chinese Medicine, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'School of Chinese Medicine for Post-Baccalaureate, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chinese Medicine, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Experiments and data analysis were performed in part through the use of the', 'Medical Research Core Facilities Center, Office of Research & Development at', 'China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'China Medical University']",['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterografts/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice, Nude', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.22698 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2019 Apr;34(4):443-456. doi: 10.1002/tox.22698.

The procedure seems to fasten post-transplant hematological recovery, but it does not have an impact on survival. The role of pre-transplant splenic irradiation (SI) is much more difficult to evaluate. Forty-four patients (25 males and 19 females) with MF at median age of 49 years at diagnosis (range 14-67) underwent ASCT. The post-transplant outcome was compared between irradiated and non-irradiated patients. Eleven patients received irradiation before transplantation. Median dose of radiation was 1000 cGy (range 600-2400). There was no difference in median time to engraftment between patients with and without previous radiotherapy. Acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurred in 47% and 36% of patients, respectively. There was no difference in GVHD incidence between groups. Eight patients relapsed/progressed in irradiated group versus 17 in non-irradiated (70% vs. 51%; p = 0.3). Transformation to acute myeloid leukemia was observed in 3 patients: 2 in irradiated and 1 in non-irradiated group. In total, 22 patients died with no statistical difference in death rate between irradiated and non-irradiated subjects. The probability of overall survival after transplant for the entire cohort at 2 years was 54% (72% for irradiated and 48% for non-irradiated patients; p = 0.25). Splenic irradiation prior to ASCT for myelofibrosis has not beneficial effect on post-transplant outcome.","['Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Wieczorkiewicz-Kabut, Agata', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Krzemien, Helena', 'Wojciak, Michal', 'Bialas, Krzysztof', 'Kopera, Malgorzata', 'Rzenno, Ewa', 'Wozniczka, Krzysztof', 'Kopinska, Anna', 'Grygoruk-Wisniowska, Iwona', 'Koclega, Anna']","['Helbig G', 'Wieczorkiewicz-Kabut A', 'Markiewicz M', 'Krzemien H', 'Wojciak M', 'Bialas K', 'Kopera M', 'Rzenno E', 'Wozniczka K', 'Kopinska A', 'Grygoruk-Wisniowska I', 'Koclega A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3703-1268'],"['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland. ghelbig@o2.pl.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', ""Students' Research Group, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."", 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Dabrowski Street 25, 40-032, Katowice, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6326000,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-019-1245-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-019-1245-5 [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2019 Jan 8;36(2):16. doi: 10.1007/s12032-019-1245-5.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Myelofibrosis', 'Outcome', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenic irradiation', 'Splenomegaly']",,,20190108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequential conditioning has been successfully used for SCT in hrAML in HLA-matched transplants, and found its way into HLA-haploidentical SCT (haplo-SCT) later on. Hence, sequential conditioning had become standard for all patients with hrAML in our two centers, regardless of donor type. Thereby, HLA-matched family or unrelated transplants were first/second choice, post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY)-based haplo-SCT was chosen in patients missing matched donors or requiring urgent transplantation. To compare the outcome after HLA-matched and haplo-SCT for hrAML following sequential conditioning, we performed a retrospective, matched-pair comparison, using disease stage, genetic subgroups and age as matching criteria. Thirty-four well-matched pairs were identified. At SCT, patients (median age 54 years) were untreated (9%), had remission (13%), or active disease (78%). Three-year overall and leukemia-free survival (OS/LFS) of the entire cohort was 56 +/- 7%/49 +/- 7%, without significant differences between donor types (OS after HLA-matched/haplo-SCT 62 +/- 10%/52 +/- 9% (p = 0.21), LFS 53 +/- 10%/46 +/- 9% (p = 0.26)). Similarly, the cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse-mortality and chronic GvHD, as well as GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS), and chronic GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (cGRFS), were comparable.

It has shown substantial efficacy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The clinical use of ATO is hampered due to cardiotoxicity and hence many patients are precluded from receiving this highly effective treatment. An alternative to this would be to use any drug that can ameliorate the cardiotoxic effects and allow exploiting the full therapeutic potential of ATO, with considerable impact on cancer therapy. Generation of reactive oxygen species is involved in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological disorders. Hence, agents with the ability to protect against these reactive species may be therapeutically useful. The present review focuses on the beneficial as well as harmful effects of arsenic and ATO, the mechanisms underlying ATO toxicity and the possible ways that can be adopted to circumvent ATO-induced toxicity.","['Vineetha, Vadavanath Prabhakaran', 'Raghu, Kozhiparambil Gopalan']","['Vineetha VP', 'Raghu KG']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6235-9447'],"['Department of Processing Technology, Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), Panangad P.O., Kochi, 682506, India. vinnivp@gmail.com.', 'Agroprocessing and Natural Products Division, National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSIR - NIIST), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, 695019, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,Cardiovascular toxicology,101135818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12012-018-09504-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12012-018-09504-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2019 Apr;19(2):105-119. doi: 10.1007/s12012-018-09504-7.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arsenic trioxide', '*Cardiotoxicity', '*Chemotherapy', '*Phytochemicals', '*Reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which can provide direct, standards-free quantification, has recently received increasing attention. In our study, a comprehensive comparison of ddPCR with qPCR in relation to the quantification of PML-RARalpha was performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of ddPCR. Results showed that ddPCR displayed significant concordance with qPCR in the detection of PML-RARalpha in clinical samples, but showed advantages over qPCR in terms of precision, limit of detection (LOD), and other basic performance parameters. A study of the feasibility of duplexing also indicated that ddPCR could simultaneously quantify the target PML-RARalpha and the clinical common reference gene ABL in a reaction, in contrast to qPCR. Moreover, ddPCR was more tolerant than qPCR of inhibition, and was shown to be able to quantify inhibition-prone samples. Another advantage of using ddPCR in clinical applications is that it will yield accurate results for patients with PML-RARalpha levels that fluctuate around the LOD of qPCR. Therefore, ddPCR is considered to have the potential to become a reliable alternative technique for quantifying PML-RARalpha.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed methods to expand DNTs under GMP conditions and characterized their surface molecule expression pattern using flow cytometry-based high-throughput screening. We investigated the off-the-shelf potential of clinical-grade DNTs by assessing their cytotoxicity against various cancer types and their off-tumor toxicity in vitro and in xenograft models and determining the effect of cryopreservation under GMP conditions on cell viability and cytotoxicity. Further, we determined the susceptibility of DNTs to conventional allogeneic T cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Clinical-grade DNTs expanded 1,558 +/- 795.5-fold in 17 days with >90% purity. Expanded DNTs showed potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against various cancer types in a donor-unrestricted manner. DNTs enhanced the survival of mice infused with a lethal dose of EBV-LCL and significantly reduced leukemia engraftment in xenograft models. Expanded DNTs cryopreserved using GMP-compliant reagents maintained viability and anticancer functions for at least 600 days. Live allogeneic DNTs did not induce cytotoxicity of alloreactive CD8(+) T cells in vitro, and coinfusion of DNTs with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a different donor into mice resulted in coengraftment of DNTs and PBMC-derived allogeneic conventional T cells in the absence of cytotoxicity toward DNTs, suggesting the lack of host-versus-graft reaction. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a method to generate therapeutic numbers of clinical-grade DNTs that fulfill the requirements of an off-the-shelf ACT.","['Lee, Jong Bok', 'Kang, Hyeonjeong', 'Fang, Linan', ""D'Souza, Cheryl"", 'Adeyi, Oyedele', 'Zhang, Li']","['Lee JB', 'Kang H', 'Fang L', ""D'Souza C"", 'Adeyi O', 'Zhang L']",,"['Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['141723/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/01/09 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-2291 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2291 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 1;25(7):2241-2253. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2291.

The outcome of these patients is usually very poor; only a small proportion can be rescued by allogenic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of allo-HSCT in patients with refractory AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of 91 patients who were diagnosed with treatment-refractory AML at Hacettepe University Hospital between January 2002 and June 2018. Patients' disease status included refractory AML, defined as failure to respond to standard induction chemotherapy and relapse within 6 months after first complete remission. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12 months (range, 0.5-184 months) for the entire group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 3-year overall survival for patients who underwent allo-HSCT and patients who received only salvage chemotherapy were 67% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year overall survival for patients who underwent allo-HSCT and patients who received only salvage chemotherapy were 44% and 4%, respectively (P < .001). Complete remission was obtained in 25 patients (83.3%) who underwent allo-HSCT; however, the disease of only 3 patients (3.8%) exhibited complete response after salvage chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT is still the best-known treatment option with curative potential in patients with treatment-refractory AML. Therefore, all efforts should be made in an attempt to find a suitable matched donor in order to perform allo-HSCT.","['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Aladag, Elifcan', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Goker, Hakan']","['Ciftciler R', 'Demiroglu H', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Aladag E', 'Aksu S', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe O', 'Malkan UY', 'Goker H']",,"['Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.

Differential expression among various types of hematological malignancies allows considering CD150 as diagnostical and potential prognostic marker. Moreover, CD150 may be a target for antibody-based or measles virus oncolytic therapy. Due to CD150 signaling properties it is involved in regulation of malignant cell fate decision and tumor microenvironment in Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

DOT1L-mediated H3K79me has been implicated in chromatin-associated functions including gene transcription, heterochromatin formation, and DNA repair. Recent studies have uncovered a role for DOT1L in the initiation and progression of leukemia and other solid tumors. The development and availability of small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L may provide new and unique therapeutic options for certain types or subgroups of cancer. METHODS: In this study, we examined the role of DOT1L in DNA double-strand break (DSB) response and repair by depleting DOT1L using siRNA or inhibiting its methyltransferase activity using small molecule inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Cells were treated with different agents to induce DNA damage in DOT1L-depleted or -inhibited cells and analyzed for DNA repair efficiency and survival. Further, rectal cancer patient samples were analyzed for H3K79me3 levels in order to determine whether it may serve as a potential marker for personalized therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that DOT1L is required for a proper DNA damage response following DNA double-strand breaks by regulating the phosphorylation of the variant histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) and repair via homologous recombination (HR). Importantly, we show that small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L combined with chemotherapeutic agents that are used to treat colorectal cancers show additive effects. Furthermore, examination of H3K79me3 levels in rectal cancer patients demonstrates that lower levels correlate with a poorer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we conclude that DOT1L plays an important role in an early DNA damage response and repair of DNA double-strand breaks via the HR pathway. Moreover, DOT1L inhibition leads to increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and PARP inhibition, which further highlights its potential clinical utility. Our results further suggest that H3K79me3 can be useful as a predictive and or prognostic marker for rectal cancer patients.","['Kari, Vijayalakshmi', 'Raul, Sanjay Kumar', 'Henck, Jana Maria', 'Kitz, Julia', 'Kramer, Frank', 'Kosinsky, Robyn Laura', 'Ubelmesser, Nadine', 'Mansour, Wael Yassin', 'Eggert, Jessica', 'Spitzner, Melanie', 'Najafova, Zeynab', 'Bastians, Holger', 'Grade, Marian', 'Gaedcke, Jochen', 'Wegwitz, Florian', 'Johnsen, Steven A']","['Kari V', 'Raul SK', 'Henck JM', 'Kitz J', 'Kramer F', 'Kosinsky RL', 'Ubelmesser N', 'Mansour WY', 'Eggert J', 'Spitzner M', 'Najafova Z', 'Bastians H', 'Grade M', 'Gaedcke J', 'Wegwitz F', 'Johnsen SA']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1198-5805'],"['Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', ""Department of Biotechnology, Rama Devi Women's University, Bhubaneswar, 751022, India."", 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Computer Science, University Augsburg, 86159, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Section for Cellular Oncology, Gottingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB) and University Medical Center, University of Gottingen, 37077, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology and Experimental Radiooncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Tumor Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, 11796, Egypt.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Section for Cellular Oncology, Gottingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB) and University Medical Center, University of Gottingen, 37077, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075, Gottingen, Germany. steven.johnsen@med.uni-goettingen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinational DNA Repair', 'Rectal Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology']",PMC6323691,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-018-0601-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-018-0601-1 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2019 Jan 7;11(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s13148-018-0601-1.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Colorectal cancer', '*DNA damage', '*DNA double-strand breaks', '*DOT1L', '*FOLFIRI', '*H3K79me', '*Homologous recombination', '*PARP inhibition', '*gammaH2AX']",,,20190107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles in a number of cancers. There are differences in the DNA methylation pattern between men and women. In this study, we investigated whether this contributes to the sex-related difference of B cell CLL risk. METHODS: Using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern of CD19(+) B cells from 48 CLL patients (29 female patients and 19 male patients) and 28 healthy people (19 women and 9 men). RESULTS: We identified 1043 sex-related differentially methylated positions (DMPs) related to CLL, 56 of which are located on autosomes and 987 on the X chromosome. Using published B cell RNA-sequencing data, we found 18 genes covered by the DMPs also have different expression levels in male and female CLL patients. Among them, TRIB1, an autosome gene, has been shown to promote tumor growth by suppressing apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) that investigates the sex-related differences in cancer, and indicated that DNA methylation differences might contribute to the sex-related difference in CLL risk.","['Lin, Shuchun', 'Liu, Yun', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Lyu, Chen', 'Kong, Xiangyin', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Xiang, Song', 'Gao, Ying']","['Lin S', 'Liu Y', 'Goldin LR', 'Lyu C', 'Kong X', 'Zhang Y', 'Caporaso NE', 'Xiang S', 'Gao Y']",,"['Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. yinggao@sibs.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['2016YFD0400200/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Sex Differ,Biology of sex differences,101548963,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Sex Characteristics']",PMC6322323,,2019/01/09 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2018/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13293-018-0213-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13293-018-0213-7 [pii]']",epublish,Biol Sex Differ. 2019 Jan 7;10(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s13293-018-0213-7.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*DNA methylation', '*EWAS', '*Sex']",,,20190107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, an oxidized form of 5-mC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) has gained lot of attention as a regulatory epigenetic modification with prognostic and diagnostic implications for several cancers. However, there is no global study exploring the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels in CLL. Herein, using mass spectrometry and hMeDIP-sequencing, we analysed the dynamics of 5-hmC during B cell maturation and CLL pathogenesis. RESULTS: We show that naive B-cells had higher levels of 5-hmC and 5-mC compared to non-class switched and class-switched memory B-cells. We found a significant decrease in global 5-mC levels in CLL patients (n = 15) compared to naive and memory B cells, with no changes detected between the CLL prognostic groups. On the other hand, global 5-hmC levels of CLL patients were similar to memory B cells and reduced compared to naive B cells. Interestingly, 5-hmC levels were increased at regulatory regions such as gene-body, CpG island shores and shelves and 5-hmC distribution over the gene-body positively correlated with degree of transcriptional activity. Importantly, CLL samples showed aberrant 5-hmC and 5-mC pattern over gene-body compared to well-defined patterns in normal B-cells. Integrated analysis of 5-hmC and RNA-sequencing from CLL datasets identified three novel oncogenic drivers that could have potential roles in CLL development and progression. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our study suggests that the global loss of 5-hmC, accompanied by its significant increase at the gene regulatory regions, constitute a novel hallmark of CLL pathogenesis. Our combined analysis of 5-mC and 5-hmC sequencing provided insights into the potential role of 5-hmC in modulating gene expression changes during CLL pathogenesis.","['Wernig-Zorc, Sara', 'Yadav, Mukesh Pratap', 'Kopparapu, Pradeep Kumar', 'Bemark, Mats', 'Kristjansdottir, Hallgerdur Lind', 'Andersson, Per-Ola', 'Kanduri, Chandrasekhar', 'Kanduri, Meena']","['Wernig-Zorc S', 'Yadav MP', 'Kopparapu PK', 'Bemark M', 'Kristjansdottir HL', 'Andersson PO', 'Kanduri C', 'Kanduri M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2781-4779'],"['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sodra Alvsborg Hospital, Boras, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden.

To facilitate such discoveries, the European Research Infrastructure EU-OPENSCREEN was founded recently with the support of its member countries and the European Commission. Its distributed character harnesses complementary knowledge, expertise, and instrumentation in the discipline of chemical biology from 20 European partners, and its open working model ensures that academia and industry can readily access EU-OPENSCREEN's compound collection, equipment, and generated data. To demonstrate the power of this collaborative approach, this perspective article highlights recent projects from EU-OPENSCREEN partner institutions. These studies yielded (1) 2-aminoquinazolin-4(3 H)-ones as potential lead structures for new antimalarial drugs, (2) a novel lipodepsipeptide specifically inducing apoptosis in cells deficient for the pVHL tumor suppressor, (3) small-molecule-based ROCK inhibitors that induce definitive endoderm formation and can potentially be used for regenerative medicine, (4) potential pharmacological chaperones for inborn errors of metabolism and a familiar form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and (5) novel tankyrase inhibitors that entered a lead-to-candidate program. Collectively, these findings highlight the benefits of small-molecule screening, the plethora of assay designs, and the close connection between screening and medicinal chemistry within

The constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor became the standard frontline therapy. The molecular monitoring is essential. METHOD: We studied the chronic myeloid leukemia patients at the Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit Tg-Mures between 2008 and 2018. RESULTS: We followed 59 patients, median age of 45 years, female : male ratio 1.5 : 1. 80% of the patients were in chronic phase. Sokal score was low in 61%, intermediate 27% and high in 12% of the patients. The median follow-up time was 5 years and 9 months. 59% of the patients reached molecular remission (average time 11 months). The cumulative overall survival was 80% at 5 years and 76% at 10 years. The overall survival according to disease phase was 98%, 85%, 20%; according to Sokal score it was 91%, 66%, 51%. The cumulative progression-free survival was 75% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years. Only 8% of the low risk patients are progressing opposite to 77% of the high risk patients. The cumulative probability to maintain the molecular remission for 5 years is 100%, for 10 years 91% and for 15 years 52%.

This study aimed to find optimal ATG doses in patients undergoing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected medical records from 352 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n = 214), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 62), or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 76) in eight centers of Korea between 2005 and 2015. All patients received busulfan-based conditioning without total body irradiation (TBI) and received stem cells from HLA-mismatched donors. RESULTS: In the current study, 5-year overall survival rates of patients receiving low to medium doses of ATG (2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg) were higher than those receiving other doses of ATG (hazard ratio [HR], 0.528; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.311 to 0.897; p = 0.018). The incidence rates of extensive chronic GVHD (ecGVHD) after administration of low to medium doses of ATG were lower than those after other doses of ATG (HR, 0.447; 95% CI, 0.224 ton 0.889; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: The low to medium doses of ATG may be associated with improving survival outcomes and reducing incidence of ecGVHD without enhancing the chances of relapse in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing non-TBI-based HLA-mismatched allogeneic HSCT.","['Kim, Taeyun', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Park, Silvia', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Moon, Joon-Ho', 'Shin, Ho-Jin', 'Lee, Won Sik', 'Kim, Dajung', 'Lee, Ho Sup']","['Kim T', 'Choi Y', 'Lee JH', 'Park S', 'Ahn JS', 'Moon JH', 'Shin HJ', 'Lee WS', 'Kim D', 'Lee HS']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University Busan Paik Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/adverse effects', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",PMC7061010,,2019/01/09 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['kjim.2018.317 [pii]', '10.3904/kjim.2018.317 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2020 Mar;35(2):429-437. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2018.317.

The role of HMT gene variants in prostate cancer remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate HMT gene variants in the pathogenesis and prognosis of human prostate cancer, using in vitro cell studies and bioinformatics analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Integrative bioinformatics analysis of the expression of 51 HMT genes in human prostate cancer was based on datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Correlation and regression analysis were used to identify critical HMTs in prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) were performed to evaluate the function of the HMTs on prognosis. Gene expression and function of 22Rv1 human prostate carcinoma cells were studied. RESULTS The HMT genes identified to have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer included the EZH2, SETD5, PRDM12, NSD1, SETD6, SMYD1, and the WHSC1L1 gene. The EZH2, SETD5, and SMYD1 genes were selected as a prognostic panel, with the SUV420H2 HMT gene. SETD2, NSD1, and ASH1L were identified as critical genes in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), similar to mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex family members. Knockdown of the SETD5 gene in 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells in vitro inhibited cancer cell growth and migration. CONCLUSIONS HMT gene variants may have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Future studies may determine the role of HMT genes as prognostic biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer.","['Zhang, Yangjun', 'Yan, Libin', 'Yao, Weimin', 'Chen, Ke', 'Xu, Hua', 'Ye, Zhangqun']","['Zhang Y', 'Yan L', 'Yao W', 'Chen K', 'Xu H', 'Ye Z']",,"['Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, AL, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, AL, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, AL, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, AL, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, AL, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Urology of Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Prdm12 protein, human)', '0 (SMYD1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (SETD5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (SETD6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Variation/genetics', 'Histone Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC6330996,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['912294 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.912294 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Jan 7;25:193-239. doi: 10.12659/MSM.912294.,,,,,,,,20190107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such analyses have been published in a variety of clinical specialties; however, a detailed literature search showed that no such study has been done for ""myeloid neoplasms."" In order to bridge this gap, we conducted a citation analysis of the 100 most influential articles on myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: Two independent researchers extracted relevant articles from the Scopus database. These articles were then ranked in descending order of citations and a list of the top 100 original articles was made. A further, more detailed list was created containing significant discriminating characteristics. RESULTS: The top cited articles were published over a period of 47 years, with most of them being published in the 5-year interval of 2001-2005. The citations ranged from 636 to 4,039. The articles originated from 28 different countries. Most of the articles were published in high-impact journals.

Several xenograft models of zebrafish have been developed, particularly in larval stages (<48h post fertilization) when the immune system of fish is not developed. However, xenografting in adult zebrafish requires laborious and transient methods of immune suppression (gamma- irradiation or dexamethasone) that limits engraftment and survival of the tumor or fail to recapitulate specific characteristics of malignancies. Thus, the availability of a simple protocol to successfully engraft adult zebrafish, remains a challenge. The current study addresses this limitation and describes a robust method of xenografting in adult zebrafish. We describe a protocol that involves pre-conditioning of Casper, a pigmentation mutant of zebrafish with busulfan that led to a higher rate of engraftment of hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia cells.

However, the molecular functions and underlying mechanism of MOZ in AML is not well understood. Here, clinical MOZ expression analysis combined with data integration from the TCGA and GEO databases indicated that a low level of MOZ was associated with poor prognosis. MOZ knockdown inhibited monocyte differentiation and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in THP-1 or U937 cells. In addition, we found that genetic silencing of MOZ suppressed AP-1 and AKT activity in the context of lipopolysaccharide stimulation, resulting in diminished M1 activation of macrophages. We further showed that MOZ was a validated target of miR-223 and functioned as a repressor of miR-223 expression. Our study indicates that a molecular network involving MOZ and miR-223 contributes to the monocyte differentiation and polarization program, which is deregulated in AML.","['Jiang, Ming', 'Zhang, Ju', 'Qian, Lili', 'Miao, Yuhui', 'Song, Weiguo', 'Liu, Hanyuan', 'Li, Rui']","['Jiang M', 'Zhang J', 'Qian L', 'Miao Y', 'Song W', 'Liu H', 'Li R']",,"['School of Life Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, Anhui, China.

Because MPNs and JAK2(V617F)-mutated cells show genomic instability, stalled replication forks, and baseline DNA double-strand breaks, DNA repair inhibition with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitors represents a potential novel therapy. Because the alkylating agent busulfan is integral in conditioning regimens for HSCT and leads to stalled replication forks through DNA strand cross-linking, we hypothesized that PARP inhibition with veliparib in combination with busulfan may lead to synergistic cytotoxicity in MPN cells. We first treated 2 MPN cell lines harboring the JAK2(V617F) mutation (SET2 and HEL) with veliparib at increasing concentrations and measured cell proliferation. SET2 and HEL cells were relatively sensitive to veliparib (IC50 of 11.3 muM and 74.2 muM, respectively). We next treated cells with increasing doses of busulfan in combination with 4 muM veliparib and found that the busulfan IC50 decreased from 27 muM to 4 muM in SET2 cells and from 45.1 muM to 28.1 muM in HEL cells. The mean combination index was .55 for SET2 cells and .40 for HEL cells. Combination treatment of SET2 cells caused G2M arrest in 53% of cells, compared with 30% with veliparib alone and 35% with busulfan alone. G2M arrest was associated with activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, as shown by an immunofluorescence assay for phosphorylated Chk1 (p-Chk1). We then tested in vivo the effect of combined low doses of busulfan and veliparib in a JAK2(V617F) MPN-AML xenotransplant model. Vehicle- and veliparib-treated mice had similar median survival of 39 and 40 days, respectively. Combination treatment increased median survival from 47 days (busulfan alone) to 50 days (P=.02). Finally, we tested the combined effect of busulfan and veliparib on CD34(+) cells obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of 5 patients with JAK2(V617F)-mutated and 2 patients with CALR-mutated MF. MF cells treated with the combination of veliparib and busulfan showed reduced colony formation compared with busulfan alone (87% versus 68%; P=.001). In contrast, treatment of normal CD34(+) cells with veliparib did not affect colony growth. Here we show that in vivo confirmation that treatment with the PARP-1 inhibitor veliparib and busulfan results in synergistic cytotoxicity in MPN cells. Our data provide the rationale for testing novel pretransplantation conditioning regimens with combinations of PARP-1 inhibition and reduced doses of alkylators, such as busulfan and melphalan, for high-risk MPNs or MPN-derived acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Patel, Pritesh R', 'Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Rodriguez, Natalie S', 'Oh, Annie L', 'Bonetti, Elisa', 'Mahmud, Dolores', 'Barosi, Gianni', 'Mahmud, Nadim', 'Rondelli, Damiano']","['Patel PR', 'Senyuk V', 'Rodriguez NS', 'Oh AL', 'Bonetti E', 'Mahmud D', 'Barosi G', 'Mahmud N', 'Rondelli D']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; University of Illinois Cancer Center, Chicago, Illinois.

This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30-40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline ELANE mutation. Acquired mutations in CSF3R occur in >70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an ELANE mutation causes SCN; CSF3R mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with CSF3R truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the CSF3R truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor before G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data.","['Wojdyla, Tomasz', 'Mehta, Hrishikesh', 'Glaubach, Taly', 'Bertolusso, Roberto', 'Iwanaszko, Marta', 'Braun, Rosemary', 'Corey, Seth J', 'Kimmel, Marek']","['Wojdyla T', 'Mehta H', 'Glaubach T', 'Bertolusso R', 'Iwanaszko M', 'Braun R', 'Corey SJ', 'Kimmel M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9140-9765'],"['Systems Engineering Group, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.', ""Clinical Pediatrics, Division of Hospital Medicine, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, New York."", 'Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Systems Engineering Group, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine-Division of Biostatistics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL United States of America.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine-Division of Biostatistics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL United States of America.', 'Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.', 'Systems Engineering Group, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL128173/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108992/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (ELANE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Mutation Rate', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/genetics', 'Neutropenia/complications/*congenital/genetics/physiopathology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Selection, Genetic/genetics']",PMC6336352,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006664 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-18-01501 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2019 Jan 7;15(1):e1006664. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006664. eCollection 2019 Jan.,,,,,,,,20190107,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date only few cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with jumping translocations have been described and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 11 AML and 5 MDS cases with jumping translocations. The cases were analyzed by karyotyping, FISH, telomere length measurement, and next-generation sequencing with an AML/MDS gene panel. Cases with jumping translocations showed significantly (P < .01) shorter telomeres in comparison to healthy age-matched controls. Additional neo-telomeres were found in two cases. In total, eight cases showed recipient chromosomes with a breakpoint in the centromeric region all of them harboring a pathogenic variant in the TP53 gene (n = 6) and/or a loss of TP53 (n = 5). By contrast, no pathogenic variant or loss of TP53 was identified in the six cases showing recipient chromosomes with a breakpoint in the telomeric region. In conclusion, our results divide the cohort of AML and MDS cases with jumping translocations into two groups: the first group with a telomeric breakpoint of the recipient chromosome is characterized by short telomeres and a possibly telomere-based mechanism of chromosomal instability formation. The second group with a centromeric breakpoint of the recipient chromosome is defined by mutation and/or loss of TP53. We, therefore, assume that both critically short telomeres as well as pathogenic variants of TP53 influence jumping translocation formation.","['Behrens, Yvonne Lisa', 'Thomay, Kathrin', 'Hagedorn, Maike', 'Ebersold, Juliane', 'Schmidt, Gunnar', 'Lentes, Jana', 'Davenport, Claudia', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Gohring, Gudrun']","['Behrens YL', 'Thomay K', 'Hagedorn M', 'Ebersold J', 'Schmidt G', 'Lentes J', 'Davenport C', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Gohring G']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0863-8645'],"['Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Telomere Shortening', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22665 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Mar;58(3):139-148. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22665.

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the associations between these factors and hematological cancer risk in adults. Eligible cohort studies were sought in PubMed up to May 31, 2016; overall, 44 studies were included in the present analyses. Pooled relative risk estimates were calculated using random-effects models; separate analyses were conducted for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and subtypes (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL; follicular cell lymphoma; small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, SLL/CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), leukemia and subtypes (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, AML). Obesity was associated with increased risk of NHL, HL, MM, leukemia overall and AML in both sexes, as well as with higher DLBCL risk in women; the dose-response meta-regression analysis confirmed these associations. Less pronounced effects were observed regarding overweight, as it was associated with increased MM risk in both sexes, NHL risk in males, DLBCL and overall leukemia risk in females. Taller men presented with significantly higher risk of NHL and taller women were affected by higher risk of NHL, DLBCL, FL, CLL/SLL, MM, leukemia and AML. On the other hand, physical activity and abdominal fatness were not associated with the risk of hematological malignancies.

Our study investigated the potential for immunophenotyping of leukemic cells via flow cytometry and the clinical usefulness of this approach in treatment of AL. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) specimens were collected to detect antigen expression on hematopoietic cells in pre-treatment samples from patients with AL. In addition, fraction survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method to explore the effect of markers on prognosis in AL. RESULTS: Expression levels of immunophenotypic markers in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were significantly different from those in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, there was a potential association between the surface marker, cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2), and fraction survival in AML. However, no similar result was found in ALL. Moreover, genetic tests showed greater positive variation of the break point cluster-Abelson tyrosine kinase ( BCR-ABL) fusion gene in samples from patients with ALL than in samples from patients with AML.

We present seven patients with high grade myeloid neoplasms (MNs), mostly acute leukemias, having a spectrum of PDC differentiation and not fitting with MPDMN or BPDCN. METHODS: We analyzed seven MN cases having increased myeloblasts and prominent CD56-negative PDC proliferations comprising 5-26% of bone marrow or blood cellularity as measured by flow cytometry. The cases included five acute myeloid leukemia (three FAB M4 subtype, two unclassified), one mixed phenotype acute leukemia, and one case of unclassified MN. RESULTS: Six cases demonstrated immunophenotypic evidence of PDC differentiation from leukemic blasts, based on variable expression of CD34, CD45, CD123, and CD304 by the leukemic cells. Four cases had circulating PDC populations in blood. None of the cases met clinical or pathologic criteria for BPDCN. Morphologic review was available for four acute leukemia cases and demonstrated either nodular or interstitial infiltrates of PDCs. All cases had an aggressive clinical course, and three cases had FLT3 ITD mutation. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate that high grade MNs, in particular AML, can exhibit PDC differentiation, with or without monocytic differentiation, in a manner distinct from MPDMN or BPDCN. The existence of MNs with immature PDC proliferations suggests that there is a broader spectrum of PDC-associated neoplasms than currently recognized.

Inherited platelet disorders associated with minor-moderate bleeding rarely cause patient distress.

Guidelines recommend postponing genetic testing ""until the patient reaches adulthood or at least until the child is mature enough to participate in decision making"".

For a better understanding of the relationship between biomarkers and disease progression, we propose to align all subjects by using their disease progression time as the origin and then looking backward at the biomarker distributions prior to that event. We demonstrate that such backward-looking plots are much more informative than forward-looking plots when the research goal is to understand the shape of the trajectory leading up to the event of interest. Such backward-looking plotting is an easy task if disease progression is observed for all the subjects. However, when these events are censored for a significant proportion of subjects in the study cohort, their time origins cannot be identified, and the task of aligning them cannot be performed. We propose a new method to tackle this problem by considering the distributions of longitudinal biomarker data conditional on the failure time. We use landmark analysis models to estimate these distributions. Compared to a naive method, our new method greatly reduces estimation bias. We apply our method to a study for chronic myeloid leukemia patients whose BCR-ABL transcript expression levels after treatment are good indicators of residual disease. Our proposed method provides a good visualization tool for longitudinal biomarker studies for the early detection of disease.","['Huang, Xuelin', 'Liu, Lei', 'Ning, Jing', 'Li, Liang', 'Shen, Yu']","['Huang X', 'Liu L', 'Ning J', 'Li L', 'Shen Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1192-9336', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1844-338X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5453-3839']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA152958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA096300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HS020263/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', '*Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Models, Statistical', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6501595,['NIHMS1014542'],2019/01/08 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.8085 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2019 May 20;38(11):2030-2046. doi: 10.1002/sim.8085.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in diverse diseases including cancer. The lncRNA ST3Gal6 antisense 1 (ST3Gal6-AS1) derives from the promoter region of sialyltransferase ST3Gal6. However, the mechanisms by which ST3Gal6-AS1 modulates colorectal cancer (CRC) development through sialylation remain largely unknown. Here, we found that ST3Gal6-AS1 and ST3Gal6 levels were lower in tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues of CRC patients. The correlation between ST3Gal6-AS1 and ST3Gal6 was further validated in several types of CRC cell lines. In addition, ST3Gal6 was dysregulated and positively correlated to ST3Gal6-AS1. ST3Gal6-AS1 recruited histone methyltransferase MLL1 to the promoter region of ST3Gal6, induced H3K4me3 modification and activated ST3Gal6 transcription. Furthermore, ST3Gal6-AS1/ST3Gal6 axis mediated alpha-2, 3 sialylation and inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, thereby resulting in Foxo1 nuclear translocation in CRC cells. ST3Gal6-AS1 was a target of transcription factor Foxo1 and regulated by Foxo1. ST3Gal6-AS1 also inhibited CRC cell proliferation, metastasis, and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Overexpression of ST3Gal6-AS1 significantly decreased the tumorigenesis, lung and liver metastasis of SW620 cells in vivo. ST3Gal6-AS1 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis and tumor stage in CRC patients. Collectively, these data indicated that ST3Gal6-AS1, ST3Gal6, PI3K/Akt, and Foxo1 formed a positive feedback loop, which might play a key role in CRC progression.","['Hu, Jialei', 'Shan, Yujia', 'Ma, Jia', 'Pan, Yue', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Jiang, Liqun', 'Jia, Li']","['Hu J', 'Shan Y', 'Ma J', 'Pan Y', 'Zhou H', 'Jiang L', 'Jia L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3152-3253'],"['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Graduate School, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycosylation', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32103 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Jul 15;145(2):450-460. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32103.

However, the clinical features of B cell precursor leukemia (BCP-ALL) that harbor DH genetics remain widely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL registry and a literature search for de novo DH-BCP-ALLs. We identified 6 patients in the GMALL registry and 11 patients published in the literature between 1983 and June 2018. Patients of all ages (range, 15-86 years) are affected. There is a high incidence of meningeal disease and other extramedullary disease manifestations. Current treatment approaches are mainly ALL-based and are sufficient to induce first complete remissions, but progression-free survival is only 4.0 months (95% CI, 1.5-6.5 months) and all patients succumb to their disease, once relapsed, with a median survival of 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.1-6.9 months), despite intensive salvage and targeted therapy approaches. Of all patients, only two that attained an initial complete remission were alive at data cutoff. In all cases, the BCL2 gene was rearranged to be in proximity to the IGH locus, whereas MYC had various translocation partners juxtaposed. There was no significant survival difference between IG and non-IG translocation partners (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.33-3.2; p = 0.89). In conclusion, de novo DH-BCP-ALL is an aggressive B cell malignancy with deleterious outcome. Physicians have to be aware of this rare disease subset due to the atypical clinical behavior and especially because latest classification systems do not cover this sub-entity.","['Stratmann, Jan A', 'von Rose, Aaron Becker', 'Koschade, Sebastian', 'Wendelin, Knut', 'Kohler, Friedemann', 'Heinsch, Michael', 'Schiller, Kilian', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Wattad, Mohamed', 'Rieder, Harald', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Steffen, Bjorn']","['Stratmann JA', 'von Rose AB', 'Koschade S', 'Wendelin K', 'Kohler F', 'Heinsch M', 'Schiller K', 'Haferlach C', 'Wattad M', 'Rieder H', 'Serve H', 'Gokbuget N', 'Steffen B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7726-6622'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. jan.stratmann@kgu.de.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Prof.-Ernst-Nathan-Str. 1, 90419, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of.

A 68-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, and IM was started in 2002 with a dose of 400 mg/day. She had achieved complete hematological, molecular and cytogenetic remission under IM treatment. In September 2015, her creatinine level was 1.7 mg/dl. In May 2016, she was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea. Hypervolemia secondary to fluid retention was detected in our patient. Her laboratory tests results showed hemoglobin 9.7 gr/dl, white blood cell 7.6x103/mul, platelet 157x103/mul, creatinine 3.2 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 88 mg/dl. In her X-ray chest film, bilateral pleural effusion was detected. The effusion was detected as transuda. The other reasons of pleural effusion were excluded and the development of pleural effusion was considered secondary to IM. IM was also considered responsible for the acute rise of serum creatinine levels of our patient. Therefore for these two reasons IM was stopped. After the discontinuation of IM, her creatinine levels decreased to 1.6 mg/dl and her pleural effusions disappeared. IM treatment was considered as the reason of serum creatinine elevation since serum creatinine levels decreased after the discontinuation of IM.

We herein report a 58-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia, who developed fungal infection following chemotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: After administration of posaconazole oral suspension, the patient developed severe hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE -Grade 3) with a serum total bilirubin (T-BIL) peak level of 170 mumol/L, alkaline phosphatase level of 739 U/L, alanine aminotransferase level of 99 U/L, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level of 638 U/L. After posaconazole withdrawal and symptomatic treatment with liver-protective agents, the level of T-BIL and other laboratory data decreased gradually, and related symptoms disappeared. After medication analysis and literature review, we consider that the patient had a cholestatic type of posaconazole-induced liver injury, which was related to intracellular mitochondrial DNA damage. The case demonstrates that when patients with hematological malignancy develop severe infection following chemotherapy, combination of anti-infective drugs may contribute to a higher risk of severe drug-induced liver injury. CONCLUSION: This is the first thoroughly documented case report of posaconazole-associated severe hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, in order to avoid severe adverse events, liver and renal function should be monitored closely before and during the administration of posaconazole.","['Song, Zai-Wei', 'Pan, Yu-Chen', 'Huang, Zhen-Cheng', 'Liu, Wen-Xi', 'Zhao, Rong-Sheng', 'Jing, Hong-Mei', 'Dong, Fei']","['Song ZW', 'Pan YC', 'Huang ZC', 'Liu WX', 'Zhao RS', 'Jing HM', 'Dong F']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China. knowflying@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,,,PMC6306636,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/01/08 06:01,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v6.i16.1206 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2018 Dec 26;6(16):1206-1209. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v6.i16.1206.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Case report', 'Hyperbilirubinemia', 'Liver injury', 'Posaconazole']",,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts', 'of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high potential of the PEGylated comb-like polymeric nanocarrier (PNC) in delivering both traditional and experimental drugs to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated previously. In the present study, we investigated the general toxicity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) processed with both covalent and non-covalent attachments of PEG to compose a comb-like polymer that behaves like a simple chain of n monomers decorated with swollen side chains. The PNC possesses properties of a water-soluble surfactant containing methyl-terminated PEG side branches in some monomer units attached covalently to the carbon chain backbone. Results: We have demonstrated that the synthesized PNC possesses weak toxic effects toward human leukemia cells (HL-60 and Jurkat lines), as well as toward hepatocellular (HepG2), colon (HCT116) and breast (MCF-7) tumor cell lines. Additionally, after a long period (20 days) of intraperitoneal administration, the PNC had no significant toxic effects in laboratory white mice (470 mg/kg body mass in 1 ml) and Wistar rats (440 mg/kg body mass in 10 ml). Conclusion: The developed PNC we studied can be qualified as a compound of grade 4 toxicity (low toxicity substance). The reduced toxicity of this PNC in combination with its improved bioavailability and previously detected capability to enhance cytotoxicity toward tumor cells in vitro and potential tumor treatment effects in vivo suggests its potential as a safe drug delivery platform for treating various diseases, especially cancer.","['Kobylinska, Lesya', 'Patereha, Igor', 'Finiuk, Natalia', 'Mitina, Natalia', 'Riabtseva, Anna', 'Kotsyumbas, Igor', 'Stoika, Rostyslav', 'Zaichenko, Alexander', 'Vari, Sandor G']","['Kobylinska L', 'Patereha I', 'Finiuk N', 'Mitina N', 'Riabtseva A', 'Kotsyumbas I', 'Stoika R', 'Zaichenko A', 'Vari SG']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8965-8436'],"['1Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University, Pekarska str., 69a, Lviv, 79010 Ukraine.0000 0004 0563 0685grid.411517.7', 'State Scientific-Research Control Institute of Veterinary Medicinal Products and Feed Additives, Donetska str., 11, Lviv, 79019 Ukraine.', '3Institute of Cell Biology, Drahomanov str., 14/16, Lviv, 79005 Ukraine.grid.466769.c', '4Lviv Polytechnic National University, S.

METHODS: Hematologic cancer patients admitted for chemotherapy were reviewed. They received a rehabilitation program during their hospital stay. DEMMI score measurement was performed, before and after rehabilitation. Demographics, diagnosis, chemotherapy information, rehabilitation program duration, mortality, body mass index (BMI), and laboratory test results were collected. For analysis, patients were classified according to diagnosis (multiple myeloma, leukemia, and others), mortality, and additional chemotherapy. RESULTS: There was statistically significant improvement in DEMMI score of 10.1 points (95% confidence interval, 5.9-14.3) after rehabilitation. It was more evident in the multiple myeloma group, and they revealed less mortality. When patients were divided according to mortality, survivors received the program earlier, and in a shorter period than in mortality cases. Although survivors revealed higher initial DEMMI score, improvement after rehabilitation did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: In hematologic cancer patients, rehabilitation program was effective for recovery from deconditioning, revealing significant increase in DEMMI score. Multiple myeloma patients may be good candidates for rehabilitation. Rehabilitation could be sustained during chemotherapy and for high-risk patients.","['Cha, Seungwoo', 'Kim, Inho', 'Lee, Shi-Uk', 'Seo, Kwan Sik']","['Cha S', 'Kim I', 'Lee SU', 'Seo KS']",,"['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['800-20180121/National Research Foundation of Korea'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Ann Rehabil Med,Annals of rehabilitation medicine,101573065,,,,PMC6325318,,2019/01/08 06:00,2019/01/08 06:01,['2019/01/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['arm.2018.42.6.838 [pii]', '10.5535/arm.2018.42.6.838 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Rehabil Med. 2018 Dec;42(6):838-845. doi: 10.5535/arm.2018.42.6.838.

Here we show that ADAR1-induced hyper-editing in normal human hematopoietic progenitors impairs miR-26a maturation, which represses CDKN1A expression indirectly via EZH2, thereby accelerating cell-cycle transit. However, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors, loss of EZH2 expression and increased CDKN1A oppose cell-cycle transit. Moreover, A-to-I editing of both the MDM2 regulatory microRNA and its binding site within the 3' UTR region stabilizes MDM2 transcripts, thereby enhancing blast crisis progenitor propagation. These data reveal a dual mechanism governing malignant transformation of progenitors that is predicated on hyper-editing of cell-cycle-regulatory miRNAs and the 3' UTR binding site of tumor suppressor miRNAs.","['Jiang, Qingfei', 'Isquith, Jane', 'Zipeto, Maria Anna', 'Diep, Raymond H', 'Pham, Jessica', 'Delos Santos, Nathan', 'Reynoso, Eduardo', 'Chau, Julisia', 'Leu, Heather', 'Lazzari, Elisa', 'Melese, Etienne', 'Ma, Wenxue', 'Fang, Rongxin', 'Minden, Mark', 'Morris, Sheldon', 'Ren, Bing', 'Pineda, Gabriel', 'Holm, Frida', 'Jamieson, Catriona']","['Jiang Q', 'Isquith J', 'Zipeto MA', 'Diep RH', 'Pham J', 'Delos Santos N', 'Reynoso E', 'Chau J', 'Leu H', 'Lazzari E', 'Melese E', 'Ma W', 'Fang R', 'Minden M', 'Morris S', 'Ren B', 'Pineda G', 'Holm F', 'Jamieson C']",,"['Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center and Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA; Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

Methods: Retrospectively analyzed those AL patients who underwent allo-HSCT in the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine during Jan 2016 to Dec 2017, a total number of 314 cases, 163 males and 151 females, median age was 30 (9-64) years old. Comparing the difference of WT1 expression at diagnosed, pre-HSCT and after HSCT. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the WT1 threshold at different time so as to predict relapse. The threshold of WT1 expression before transplantation was 1.010%, within 3 months after HSCT was 0.079% and 6 months after HSCT was 0.375%. According to these thresholds, WT1 positive patients were divided into low expression groups and high expression groups. Analyzed the relationship between overall survival (OS) , disease-free survival (DFS) , cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and WT1 expression. Results: The OS and DFS of high expression group pre-HSCT were lower than low expression group [69.2% (9/13) vs 89.1% (57/64) , chi(2)=4.086, P=0.043; 53.8% (7/13) vs 87.5% (56/64) , chi(2)=9.766, P=0.002], CIR was higher than low expression group [30.8% (4/13) vs 7.8% (5/64) , P=0.017]. There was no significant difference of OS and DFS between high expression and low expression group of 3 months after HSCT (P=0.558, P=0.269) . The OS and DFS of high expression group of 6 months after transplantation were both lower than low expression group (P=0.049, P=0.035) . Multivariate analysis showed that WT1>0.375% when 6 months after transplantation was the only independent prognostic factor for shorter DFS (P=0.022) . There was no statistically significant difference in CIR between the high-expression group and the low-expression group 3 months after transplantation and 6 months after transplantation (P=0.114, P=0.306) .

Methods: From July 2014 to April 2018, the clinical data of forty-two AML/MDS patients with RUNX1 mutations in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristic features and distribution of the mutations frequently observed with RUNX1 mutations were summarized, the prognosis of allo-HSCT for these patients was also analyzed. Results: Among 42 AML/MDS patients with RUNX1 mutations, 27 were male, 15 were female. The median age was 43.5 (16-68) years old. There are 31 patients in allo-HSCT group and 11 patients in chemotherapy group. RUNX1 mutations co-occurred with many other gene mutations, the most frequent mutations were FLT3 (26.2%, 11/42) . Interestingly, FLT3 mutations only occurred in AML patients compared with MDS patients (P=0.014) . ASXL1 (25%, 3/12) mutations were observed as the most frequent co-mutations in MDS patients. One-year overall survival (OS) , disease-free survival (DFS) of allo-HSCT and chemotherapy patients were (70.6+/-9.0) %, (61.0+/-9.4) % and (34.4+/-16.7) %, (22.4+/-15.3) %, respectively. When OS and DFS between allo-HSCT and chemotherapy patients were compared, significant differences (chi(2)=4.843, 4.320, P<0.05) were showed. In univariate analysis, transplant age >45 years was a negative effect for OS [HR=4.819 (95% CI 1.145-20.283) , P=0.032] and DFS [HR=5.945 (95% CI 1.715-20.604) , P=0.005].

Methods: Data of consecutive cases of 18-65 years adults with de novo AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia) were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, early responses and outcomes across different age groups of patients were analyzed. Results: 1 097 patients were enrolled. 591 (53.9%) were male. Median age was 42 years. Increasing age was significantly associated with decreasing WBC count (P=0.003), increasing PLT count (P=0.034), lower blast proportions in bone marrow (P=0.021). The incidence of NPM1(+)/FLT3-ITD(-) increased with age (P<0.001).

According to the hypothesis of this study, MZF-1 mediates LIF-induced neuroprotective signaling during ELVO through increased expression and transcriptional activity. To determine the in vivo role of MZF-1 in LIF-induced neuroprotection, we used Genomatix software was used to MZF-1 sites in the promoter region of the rat superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) gene. Stroke was induced via middle cerebral artery occlusion, and animals were administered PBS or 125 mug/kg LIF at 6, 24, and 48 h after the injury. MZF-1 binding activity was measured using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and its expression/localization were determined using western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. To determine whether MZF-1 relays LIF-induced neuroprotection in vitro, primary cultured neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) after treatment with PBS or LIF. MZF-1 expression was measured in vitro using real time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Transfection with siRNA was used to determine whether LIF protected cultured neurons against OGD after silencing MZF-1 expression. Four MZF-1 binding sites were identified by Genomatix, and EMSA confirmed in vivo binding activity in brain after MCAO. LIF significantly increased MZF-1 protein levels compared to PBS treatment at 72 h post-MCAO. In vivo nuclear localization of MZF-1 as well as co-localization of SOD3 and MZF-1 was observed in the cortical neurons of LIF-treated rats. Primary cultured neurons treated with LIF had significantly higher levels of MZF-1 mRNA and protein after LIF treatment compared to neurons treated with PBS. Finally, knockdown MZF-1 using siRNA counteracted the neuroprotective effects of LIF in vitro. These data demonstrate that LIF-mediated neuroprotection is dependent upon MZF-1 activity. Furthermore, these findings identify a novel neuroprotective pathway that employs MZF-1, a transcription factor associated with hematopoietic gene expression.","['Davis, Stephanie M', 'Collier, Lisa A', 'Foran, Elspeth A', 'Leonardo, Christopher C', 'Ajmo, Craig T Jr', 'Pennypacker, Keith R']","['Davis SM', 'Collier LA', 'Foran EA', 'Leonardo CC', 'Ajmo CT Jr', 'Pennypacker KR']",,"['Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky, 741 S.

They are characterized by the presence of driver mutations of JAK2, CALR or MPL genes. Overexpression of WT1 is used as a marker of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia, especially after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We investigated WT1 expression at diagnosis in 152 MPN patients and showed that the WT1 transcript was overexpressed in PMFs and PVs compared to controls. In particular, WT1 transcript levels were higher in PMF than in ET and PV. WT1 transcript levels were significantly increased during myelofibrotic transformation of ET or PV. Using multivariate linear regression, high WT1 transcript levels in PMF were associated with age over 65, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. The ROC curve analysis showed that a level of WT1 transcript >10 WT1 copies/10(4)ABL1 enabled the diagnosis of PMF with a specificity of 95.8% (PMF vs ET; ROC AUC=0.91). In myelofibrosis, studying follow-ups of WT1 transcript showed that this marker is of interest after allogeneic SCT. These results demonstrate that WT1 overexpression is a simple marker of myelofibrosis in MPN and could be used during patient follow-up.","['Cottin, Laurane', 'Riou, Jeremie', 'Boyer, Francoise', 'Bouvier, Anne', 'Zannetti, Alain', 'Blouet, Anaise', 'Truchan-Graczyk, Matgorzata', 'Jouanneau-Courville, Rebecca', 'Beucher, Annaelle', 'Ribourtout, Benedicte', 'Orvain, Corentin', 'Hunault-Berger, Mathilde', 'Blanchet, Odile', 'Ugo, Valerie', 'Luque Paz, Damien']","['Cottin L', 'Riou J', 'Boyer F', 'Bouvier A', 'Zannetti A', 'Blouet A', 'Truchan-Graczyk M', 'Jouanneau-Courville R', 'Beucher A', 'Ribourtout B', 'Orvain C', 'Hunault-Berger M', 'Blanchet O', 'Ugo V', 'Luque Paz D']",,"[""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France; INSERM, CRCINA, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; INSERM, UMR 1066, CNRS 6021, MINT, Universite d'Angers, Angers, France."", ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France; CHU Angers, Service des Maladies du Sang, Angers, France."", ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France."", 'CH de Cholet, Hematologie clinique, Cholet, France.', 'CH de Cholet, Hematologie clinique, Cholet, France.', 'CH de Saumur, Hematologie clinique, Saumur, France.', ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France."", ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France."", ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; INSERM, CRCINA, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France; CHU Angers, Service des Maladies du Sang, Angers, France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France; CHU Angers, Service des Maladies du Sang, Angers, France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France; INSERM, CRCINA, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France; CHU Angers, Centre de ressources biologiques, BB-0033-00038 Angers, France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France; INSERM, CRCINA, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France."", ""Universite Angers, UFR Sante, Angers, France; CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France; INSERM, CRCINA, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, France; Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), France.

Gratifyingly, the investigation revealed several compounds featuring substituted aromatic five-membered-ring heterocycles with significant activity against murine and human leukemic cellular models. The identified compounds represent potentially novel antileukemic molecular scaffolds exemplified by compounds 1, 2 and 7, which demonstrated EC50 values in the nanomolar and low micromolar range against various leukemia subtypes (SUP-B15, KOPN-8, NALM-06, UoC-B1 cellular models) and pro-apoptotic properties in solid tumor cell models (MDA-MB-231, SUM149) with ample therapeutic index in normal cells.

Current treatments for lymphocyte-associated conditions are incompletely effective and/or complicated by a range of off-target toxicities. One major challenge is poor drug access to lymphocytes via the systemic blood and this may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that lymphocytes are concentrated within lymph fluid and lymphoid tissues, particularly in gut-associated lymphatics. Here we demonstrate that promoting drug uptake into the intestinal lymphatics with a long chain fatty acid, thereby increasing lymphocyte access, enhances the pharmacodynamic effect of a highly lipophilic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, WAY-252623, that has been suggested as a potential treatment for atherosclerosis. This has been exemplified by: (1) increased mRNA expression of key markers of LXR activation (ABCA1) and regulatory T cells (Foxp3) in local lymphatic lymphocytes and (2) enhanced numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the systemic circulation, after administration of a 5-fold lower dose with a lymph directing lipid formulation when compared with a non-lipid containing formulation. These data suggest that combining lipophilic, lymphotropic drug candidates such as WAY-252,623, with lymph-directing long chain lipid based formulations can enhance drug targeting to, and activity on, lymphocytes in lymph and that this effect persists through to the systemic circulation. This presents a promising approach to achieve more selective and effective therapeutic outcomes for the treatment of lymphocyte associated diseases.","['Cao, Enyuan', 'Lindgren, Anna', 'Martinsson, Sofia', 'Hu, Luojuan', 'Lindfors, Lennart', 'Sigfridsson, Kalle', 'Skantze, Urban', 'Michaelsson, Erik', 'Trevaskis, Natalie L', 'Porter, Christopher J H']","['Cao E', 'Lindgren A', 'Martinsson S', 'Hu L', 'Lindfors L', 'Sigfridsson K', 'Skantze U', 'Michaelsson E', 'Trevaskis NL', 'Porter CJH']",,"['Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine and Genomics, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Bioscience Heart Failure, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Advanced Drug Delivery, Pharmaceutical Sciences, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Advanced Drug Delivery, Pharmaceutical Sciences, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Advanced Drug Delivery, Pharmaceutical Sciences, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Bioscience Heart Failure, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

We also discovered that miR-15/16 are negative regulators of the BCL2 oncogene. Thus the loss of the two negative regulators causes BCL2 overexpression and leukemia. A corollary of this is that CLL is very sensitive to the anti BCL2 drug venetoclax that can induce complete remission in CLL patients. Since leukemia patients may carry billions of leukemia cells, it is quite likely that some (few) of the leukemic cells are resistant to venetoclax. Thus, since microRNAs have multiple targets, we looked for other proteins that may be overexpressed in CLL because of the low of miR-15/16. We discovered that ROR1 an embryonal antigen expressed on most ( approximately 90%) CLL, but not on normal B cell, is also regulated by miR-15/16. Thus CLL cells are also sensitive to monoclonal antibodies against ROR1. Venetoclax and monoclonal antibodies against ROR1 act synergistically in killing CLL cells.","['Pekarsky, Yuri', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Pekarsky Y', 'Croce CM']",,"['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.

Information on manual dexterity in this cohort is still limited. OBJECTIVES: We tested survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy-only for fine-motor function in terms of drawing and handwriting abilities using a Digitizing Tablet (DT) with three tasks for drawing and handwriting of varying complexity, for ataxia using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and for tremor and hand-eye coordination using the Nine Hole Steadiness Tester (NHST). RESULTS: We examined a cohort of non-irradiated survivors (n = 31) after a median time of 3.5 years after end of therapy. In all tasks of the DT the cohort demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) impairment of speed, automation, and variability in at least two tasks and significantly more pressure. Impaired speed (SPV) inversely correlated with lag time since end of therapy. Dexterity performance of six survivors (19%) lay below the 5th percentile. No survivor exhibited ataxia, tremor, or impaired hand-steadiness. CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of gross ataxia, tremor, and impaired hand-eye coordination, we nevertheless detected significant fine-motor impairment in a relevant number of survivors of childhood ALL. Prospective studies are needed to reveal the pathophysiological underpinnings and genetic risk factors for development of such deficits due to ALL and its treatment.","['Goebel, Anna-Maria', 'Koustenis, Elisabeth', 'Rueckriegel, Stefan M', 'Pfuhlmann, Laura', 'Brandsma, Rick', 'Sival, Deborah', 'Skarabis, Horst', 'Schuelke, Markus', 'Hernaiz Driever, Pablo']","['Goebel AM', 'Koustenis E', 'Rueckriegel SM', 'Pfuhlmann L', 'Brandsma R', 'Sival D', 'Skarabis H', 'Schuelke M', 'Hernaiz Driever P']",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany; Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropediatrics and NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Institute of Sociology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropediatrics and NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Germany.

However, the high CD47 expression in human lymphoma cells has limited the curative effects of blinatumomab other antibodies. Here we report the combined use of blinatumomab with a CD47-blocking antibody. CD47 antibodies preferentially enabled phagocytosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells by both human and murine macrophages. Treatment of human non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell-engrafted mice with CD47 antibody and blinatumomab separately inhibited lymphoma partially, while combination treatment led to persistent control of lymphoma. These antibodies enhanced the therapeutic efficacy through mechanisms combining both innate and adaptive immune responses by induction of phagocytosis and T cell cytotoxicity. The combination strategy in this study might be applicable to many other cancers.","['Xu, Lijun', 'Wang, Shanlong', 'Li, Jie', 'Li, Bingyu']","['Xu L', 'Wang S', 'Li J', 'Li B']",,"['College of Medical, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'College of Medical, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.

To explore this phenomenon we used sequential CTLA4Ig primed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based haploidentical transplantation. Thirty patients (CTLA4Ig-DLI group) with advanced leukemia received CTLA4Ig on day -1 and subsequently on days +7, +21, and +35, followed 12hours later by DLI of 1 to 10x10(6) CD3(+) T cells/kg containing .1 to 3.27x10(6)/kg CD56(+) NK cells, with low dose cyclosporine for 60days. The incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 6.7%, 21%, and 4.5 %, respectively, with disease progression of 23.3% and overall survival of 79% at 18 months. Patients without disease progression had a significant early surge in CD56(dim)CD16(+)NK cells with lower NKG2A expression. CTLA4Ig primed DLI was associated with an upregulation of CD86 in mature NK cells that was not witnessed with CTLA4Ig administration alone. Thus, CTLA4Ig primed DLI resulted in early proliferation of mature NK cells with cytotoxic potential enabling early institution of adoptive immunotherapy to mitigate the risk of relapse in advanced leukemia with reduced GVHD and NRM.","['Jaiswal, Sarita Rani', 'Bhakuni, Prakash', 'Joy, Aby', 'Kaushal, Sakshi', 'Chakrabarti, Aditi', 'Chakrabarti, Suparno']","['Jaiswal SR', 'Bhakuni P', 'Joy A', 'Kaushal S', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Chakrabarti S']",,"['Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, India; Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.

In this study, the apoptotic effect of NaF with human mononuclear leukemia THP-1 cells and the inhibition of alpha-naphthol acetate esterase (alpha-NAE) activity, and also the potentially underlying mechanisms were investigated. METHODS: THP-1 cells were cultured with different concentrations of NaF (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mM) for 24, 48 and 72 hrs. The alpha-NAE staining and chromogenic method were used to detect the activation of alpha-NAE. The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2), 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect the antitumor effect of NaF on THP-1 cells in vitro. Flow cytometry was used to observe the apoptotic ratio following treatment with NaF in THP-1 cells. The mRNA levels of mammalian target of Bcl-2 and Bax were detected pre and post-NaF treatment using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The generation of depression effects of THP-1 cells cultured in vitro were detected using MTT technology, which revealed a dose- and time-dependent association. After 24hrs of exposure to NaF at greater than 1mmol/L, typical apoptotic changes were observed, accompanied by the alpha-NAE positive reaction and decreased intensity. The IC50 was 4 mmol/L at 24hrs. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that treatment with NaF at concentrations of 2, 4 and 8 mmol/L increased the apoptotic rate of THP-1 cells. RT-PCR indicated that NaF upregulated the gene expression of Bax and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: NaF inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells and the activation of alpha-NAE by adversely regulating the expression of Bax and Bcl-2.","['Jiang, Hongmei', 'Fang, Peng', 'Zhang, Guoping']","['Jiang H', 'Fang P', 'Zhang G']",,"['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Cariostatic Agents)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (NAE protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cariostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Sodium Fluoride/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/*metabolism']",,,2019/01/06 06:00,2019/08/31 06:00,['2019/01/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2018 Nov-Dec;23(6):1832-1839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL leukemias result from leukemic stem cell/progenitor transformation and represent an opportunity to identify epigenetic progress contributing to lineage leukemogenesis. Primary human and murine BCR-ABL(+) leukemic progenitors have increased activation of Cdc42 and the downstream atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). While the isoform aPKCzeta behaves as a leukemic suppressor, aPKClambda/iota is critically required for oncogenic progenitor proliferation, survival, and B-cell differentiation arrest, but not for normal B-cell lineage differentiation. In vitro and in vivo B-cell transformation by BCR-ABL requires the downregulation of key genes in the B-cell differentiation program through an aPKC lambda/iota-Erk dependent Etv5/Satb2 chromatin repressive signaling complex. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of aPKC impairs human oncogenic addicted leukemias. Therefore, the aPKClambda/iota-SATB2 signaling cascade is required for leukemic BCR-ABL(+) B-cell progenitor transformation and is amenable to non-tyrosine kinase inhibition.","['Nayak, R C', 'Hegde,

We sequenced coding regions or hotspot areas of 66 recurrently mutated genes in a cohort of 331 t(8;21) patients. At least 1 mutation, in addition to t(8;21), was identified in 95%, with a mean of 2.2 driver mutations per patient. Recurrent mutations occurred in genes related to RAS/RTK signaling (63.4%), epigenetic regulators (45%), cohesin complex (13.6%), MYC signaling (10.3%), and the spliceosome (7.9%). Our study identified mutations in previously unappreciated genes: GIGYF2, DHX15, and G2E3 Based on high mutant levels, pairwise precedence, and stability at relapse, epigenetic regulator mutations were likely to occur before signaling mutations. In 34% of RAS/RTK(mutated) patients, we identified multiple mutations in the same pathway. Deep sequencing ( approximately 42 000x) of 126 mutations in 62 complete remission samples from 56 patients identified 16 persisting mutations in 12 patients, of whom 5 lacked RUNX1-RUNX1T1 in quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. KIT (high) mutations defined by a mutant level >/=25% were associated with inferior relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.15; P = .005). Together with age and white blood cell counts, JAK2, FLT3-internal tandem duplication(high), and KIT (high) mutations were identified as significant prognostic factors for overall survival in multivariate analysis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 19 paired diagnosis, remission, and relapse trios. Exome-wide analysis showed an average of 16 mutations with signs of substantial clonal evolution. Based on the resemblance of diagnosis and relapse pairs, genetically stable (n = 13) and unstable (n = 6) subgroups could be identified.","['Christen, Friederike', 'Hoyer, Kaja', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Waldhueter, Nils', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Chan, Willy', 'Hablesreiter, Raphael', 'Blau, Olga', 'Ochi, Yotaro', 'Klement, Piroska', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Blau, Igor-Wolfgang', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Zemojtel, Tomasz', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Linch, David C', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Damm, Frederik']","['Christen F', 'Hoyer K', 'Yoshida K', 'Hou HA', 'Waldhueter N', 'Heuser M', 'Hills RK', 'Chan W', 'Hablesreiter R', 'Blau O', 'Ochi Y', 'Klement P', 'Chou WC', 'Blau IW', 'Tang JL', 'Zemojtel T', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Shiozawa Y', 'Thol F', 'Ganser A', 'Lowenberg B', 'Linch DC', 'Bullinger L', 'Valk PJM', 'Tien HF', 'Gale RE', 'Ogawa S', 'Damm F']",,"['Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Centre for Trials Research, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Core Genomics Facility, Charite, University Medical Center, Berlin, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Sequence Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom;

Two approaches were compared: a stable isotope dilution (SID) method- used as a reference and a modified SID (mSID) procedure. In SID strategy the calibration curves were used, whereas in mSID the ratio between the chromatogram peak area of endogenous tryptic peptides at unknown concentration to chromatogram peak area of exogenous, stable isotope-labelled internal standards (SISs) added to the sample at known concentration was calculated. The microLC/MS-MRM method in the SID approach was linear from 0.250 pmol/mL to 250 pmol/mL for Angpt-2; 5 pmol/mL to 5000 pmol/mL for sFLT-1; 2.5 pmol/mL to 5000 pmol/mL for PAI-1; 0.375 pmol/mL to 250 pmol/mL for t-PA; 0.375 pmol/mL to 187.5 pmol/mL for ESM-1; 2.5 pmol/mL to 5000 pmol/mL for sE-sel and 0.375 pmol/mL to 250 pmol/mL for ADM. LPS-induced changes in plasma assessed based on SID and mSID approaches gave comparable quantitative results and featured LPS-induced dysregulation of endothelial permeability (Angpt-2, sFLT-1), glycocalyx injury (SDC-1) accompanied by a pro-thrombotic response (PAI-1). In addition, we applied microLC/MS-MRM method with mSID strategy to analyze human plasma samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and demonstrated usefulness of the method to characterize endothelial function in humans. In conclusion, the microLC/MS-MRM method with mSID strategy applied for simultaneous quantification of protein biomarkers of endothelial function in plasma represents a novel targeted proteomic platform for the comprehensive evaluation of endothelial function in mice and humans.","['Suraj, Joanna', 'Kurpinska, Anna', 'Sternak, Magdalena', 'Smolik, Magdalena', 'Niedzielska-Andres, Ewa', 'Zakrzewska, Agnieszka', 'Sacha, Tomasz', 'Kania, Aleksander', 'Chlopicki, Stefan', 'Walczak, Maria']","['Suraj J', 'Kurpinska A', 'Sternak M', 'Smolik M', 'Niedzielska-Andres E', 'Zakrzewska A', 'Sacha T', 'Kania A', 'Chlopicki S', 'Walczak M']",,"['Jagiellonian University, Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Bobrzynskiego 14, 30-348 Krakow, Poland; Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair and Department of Toxicology, Medyczna 9, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University, Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Bobrzynskiego 14, 30-348 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University, Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Bobrzynskiego 14, 30-348 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair and Department of Toxicology, Medyczna 9, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair and Department of Toxicology, Medyczna 9, 30-688 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University, Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Bobrzynskiego 14, 30-348 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Medicine, Chair and Department of Haematology, Kopernika 17, 31-501 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pulmonology, II Chair of Internal Medicine, Skawinska 8, 31-066 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian University, Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Bobrzynskiego 14, 30-348 Krakow, Poland; Jagiellonian University Medical College, Faculty of Medicine, Chair of Pharmacology, Grzegorzecka 16, 31-531 Krakow, Poland.

We hypothesized that P. santalinus might have therapeutic potential in alleviating allergy and atopic dermatitis. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory effects of P. santalinus extract against allergic responses and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis-like dorsal skin lesions using immunoglobulin E-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cells and NC/Nga mice. Degranulation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were conducted to measure degranulation, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and prostaglandin E2 concentrations in immunoglobulin E/antigen-sensitized RBL-2H3 mast cells. The therapeutic efficacy of P. santalinus extract in 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis was evaluated through morphological, physiological, and immunological analysis. P. santalinus extract inhibited beta-hexosaminidase and histamine release and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, and prostaglandin E2 secretion. Furthermore, P. santalinus extract suppressed atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions by regulating the serum levels of immunoglobulin E and immunoglobulin G2a, and messenger ribonucleic acid expression of T helper cell 1- and T helper cell 2-related mediators in the skin lesions. Histopathological analyses showed a decrease in epidermal thickness and intradermal inflammatory cell infiltration. These results suggested that P. santalinus extract might have beneficial effects in treating allergic and atopic dermatitis-like skin disorders.","['Ham, Baknoon', 'Kim, Myungsuk', 'Son, Yang-Ju', 'Chang, Sungyul', 'Jung, Sang Hoon', 'Nho, Chu Won', 'Kwon, Man Jae']","['Ham B', 'Kim M', 'Son YJ', 'Chang S', 'Jung SH', 'Nho CW', 'Kwon MJ']",,"['Graduate School of Energy and Environment, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Natural Products Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Smart Farm Solution Convergence Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Natural Products Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Smart Farm Solution Convergence Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Smart Farm Solution Convergence Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Natural Products Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Smart Farm Solution Convergence Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Energy and Environment, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pterocarpus santalinus extract)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'D241E059U6 (Dinitrofluorobenzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/chemically induced/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Dermatologic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dinitrofluorobenzene', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use', 'Pterocarpus/*chemistry', 'Rats']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/a-0824-1282 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2019 May;85(7):599-607. doi: 10.1055/a-0824-1282.

The Stoplight Program (SLP), a proactive physical therapy intervention, was administered as the standard of care during ALL treatment to prevent and minimize these impairments. The purpose of this follow-up study was to measure body function and activity limitations in ALL survivors who completed the SLP and compare them to a pre-SLP control group, thus evaluating the longer term impact of the SLP. PROCEDURE: Two cohorts of survivors of pediatric ALL ages 5 to 18 years were assessed 18 to 24 months after completing ALL treatment. Measurements included both the body coordination subtest and the strength and agility subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, active dorsiflexion range of motion (ADROM), and physical activity by self-report. RESULTS: The control group and SLP group did not differ in size (n = 15), mean age (9 years), or time off ALL treatment (20 months). The SLP group had better scale scores for bilateral coordination (P = 0.05), running speed/agility (P < 0.01), and strength (P = 0.01). The number of survivors with 5 degrees or greater of ADROM (right) was significantly greater in the SLP group. ADROM had a positive correlation with strength/agility standard score in the combined survivor group. CONCLUSION: The SLP is a proactive physical therapy intervention that continues to positively impact children after treatment. Referral to physical therapy should be the standard to optimize long-term function.","['Tanner, Lynn R', 'Hooke, Mary C']","['Tanner LR', 'Hooke MC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4630-6326', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6137-9224']","[""Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", ""Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", 'School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['*Activities of Daily Living', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Skills/*physiology', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*rehabilitation/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27596 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 May;66(5):e27596. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27596.

Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the effects of lncRNA HOTAIR on the immunologic rejection of leukemia cells through the Wnt/beta-catenin in mice. Mice were administrated with HOTAIR mimics as well as small interfering RNA HOTAIR to explore the regulatory role of HOTAIR. The numbers of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) and the content of hemoglobin in peripheral blood (PB) were determined. The cytokine level in PB was measured. T-lymphocyte proliferation activity, Ig production by B cells, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and the proportion of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)/CD8 T cell subsets were detected. Expression of HOTAIR, beta-catenin, cyclinD1, GSK-3beta, and c-Myc in bone marrow was determined. It was revealed that the WBC number increased, while the PLT number along with the hemoglobin content in PB decreased with the upregulated HOTAIR. Additionally, elevated HOTAIR led to decreased levels of transforming growth factor-beta, interferon-gamma, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in PB, proliferation activity in T-lymphocyte, and inhibited Ig production, NK cell activity, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 T cell subsets in B-lymphocyte. Furthermore, Wnt/beta-catenin was activated by overexpressing HOTAIR. Enhanced survival and proliferation were shown with increased expression of cyclinD1, GSK-3beta, and c-Myc in the bone marrow of mice induced by overexpressing HOTAIR. These results indicate that restored HOTAIR reduces the immunologic rejection of leukemia cells in mice by activating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.","['Li, Guo-Jie', 'Ding, Hui', 'Miao, Dong']","['Li GJ', 'Ding H', 'Miao D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5590-3210'],"['Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (HOTAIR long non-coding RNA, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/*genetics']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27705 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Jul;234(7):10386-10396. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27705.

We hypothesised that risk of certain cancers might be increased in youth born preterm versus term. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of malignancy in the context of preterm birth, according to various cancer types. METHODS: The study was designed per MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines. Articles were identified through November 2015. Observational studies exploring the association between childhood malignancy and birth characteristics were included. Of the 1658 records identified, 109 full text articles were evaluated for eligibility. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on 10/26 studies retained; 95% confidence intervals were computed and adjusted following sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: No differences in risk of primary central nervous system tumor [OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.93-1.17, 5 studies, 580 cases] and neuroblastoma [OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.90-1.32, 5 studies, 211 cases] were observed in individuals born <37 versus >/=37 weeks' gestation. Preterm birth was consistently associated with hepatoblastoma [ORs 3.12 (95% CI 2.32-4.20), 1.52 (95% CI 1.1-2.1), 1.82 (95% CI 1.01-3.26), and 2.65 (95% CI 1.98-3.55)], but not leukemia, astrocytoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, lymphoma, nephroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma or thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Children born premature may be at increased risk for hepatoblastoma but there is no strong evidence of an increased risk of primary central nervous system tumours or neuroblastoma. There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether prematurity modulates the risk of other childhood cancers.","['Paquette, Katryn', 'Coltin, Hallie', 'Boivin, Ariane', 'Amre, Devendra', 'Nuyt, Anne-Monique', 'Luu, Thuy Mai']","['Paquette K', 'Coltin H', 'Boivin A', 'Amre D', 'Nuyt AM', 'Luu TM']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2222-186X'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Sainte-Justine University Hospital and Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'CEGEP Garneau, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sainte-Justine University Hospital and Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sainte-Justine University Hospital and Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sainte-Justine University Hospital and Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Hepatoblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infant, Premature', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Pregnancy', '*Premature Birth', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6319724,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0210366 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-25142 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 4;14(1):e0210366. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0210366. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,20190104,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to study the molecular mechanism by which endometriosis develops. This study examined whether aberrant expression of LINC01541 contributes to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were stimulated with 10 nmol/L of 17beta-Estradiol (17beta-E2) to simulate ectopic cells found in endometriosis. Next, the levels of proteins related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell invasion, and metastasis were investigated. The effects of LINCO1541 silencing and overexpression were also examined in ESCs. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. ESCs stimulated with 17beta-E2 displayed increased levels of N-Cadherin and vimentin expression, but decreased levels of E-Cadherin expression. 17beta-E2 promoted the migration and invasion of ESCs, and those affects were partially reversed by overexpression of LINC01541. Furthermore, silencing of LINC01541 attenuated apoptosis and promoted the EMT of ESCs, while overexpression of LINC01541 stimulated cell apoptosis, increased the levels of caspase 3 protein, and decreased the levels of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein.

The authors report here a clinical case of MDS transformation to B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) with an associated accrual of an additional mutation following treatment with lenalidomide. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 69-year-old man presented with progressive anemia, normal white blood cell count, and thrombocytopenia consistent with MDS. He was administered lenalidomide for 27 months, then developed acute B-cell lymphocytic leukemia and acquired a previously unreported mutation in the gene enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). DIAGNOSES: After 27 months of therapy with lenalidomide, a surveillance bone marrow aspiration (BMA) revealed 90% cellularity with persistent multilineage dysplasia and a population of blasts comprising 54% of all bone marrow elements by morphology, consistent with B-ALL, even though the patient was asymptomatic. Conventional karyotype showed no signs of del(5)(q22q35) MDS, however bone marrow next-generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated the accrual of a nonsense mutation (c.211del pL71*) in exon 3 of EZH2. A confirmatory BMA yielded 70% blasts and clinical features indicative of B-ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Mini-hyper-CVD (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m x 4 doses) was administered for 21 days. OUTCOMES: A follow-up BMA was performed 2 months after mini-hyper-CVD therapy, showing dysplastic features with 25% ring sideroblasts, but no evidence of B-ALL. The patient is currently receiving monthly-low dose decitabine, ofatumumab, and dexamethasone, and is transfusion independent and asymptomatic after 7 cycles. LESSONS: The present study shows an extremely rare progression of del(5)(q22q35) MDS to B-ALL with accompanying NGS data and a newly described acquisition of an EZH2 frameshift mutation. This case highlights the importance of NGS as a diagnostic and surveillance tool for MDS.","['Burgos, Sebastian', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Fuente, Lucia', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Mela-Osorio, Maria J']","['Burgos S', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Fuente L', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Mela-Osorio MJ']",,"['Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Instituto Alexander Fleming.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'FUNDALEU, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia/complications', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6344201,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/01/17 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014011 [doi]', '00005792-201901040-00068 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jan;98(1):e14011. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Given excess risk with currently available highly potent ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) inhibitors, a number of alternate, highly potent compounds have entered the clinic to address select resistance such as the T315I mutation with the promise of greater selectivity and better adverse event profile. In addition, alternate approaches to ABL1 inhibition, targeting the myristoyl pocket of ABL1, are showing promising early results and are moving into later phase trials. SUMMARY: CML is a highly treatable form of leukemia with multiple orally available small molecule inhibitors of the activated BCR-ABL1 (breakpoint cluster region-ABL1) kinase. Despite such an array of therapy options, inadequate response to therapy remains a challenge with a substantial minority of patients facing tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, intolerance, or both. Unmet needs in Ph+ leukemia include highly selective resistant disease, multi-TKI resistant CML, and advanced phase disease.","['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],,"['Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Program, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000489 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):119-123. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000489.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent development has highlighted the importance of circRNAs as the sponge of microRNA (miRNA) in cancer. We previously reported that gga-miR-375 was downregulated in the liver tumors of chickens infected with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) by microRNA microarray assay. It can be reasonably assumed in accordance with previous studies that the gga-miR-375 may be related to circRNAs. However, the question as to which circRNA acts as the sponge for gga-miR-375 remains to be answered. In this study, circRNA sequencing results revealed that a circRNA Vav3 termed circ-Vav3 was upregulated in the liver tumors of chickens infected with ALV-J. In addition, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), biotinylated RNA pull-down and RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) experiments were conducted to confirm that circ-Vav3 serves as the sponge of gga-miR-375. Furthermore, we confirmed through dual luciferase reporter assay that YAP1 is the target gene of gga-miR-375. The effect of the sponge function of circ-Vav3 on its downstream genes has been further verified by our conclusion that the sponge function of circ-Vav3 can abrogate gga-miR-375 target gene YAP1 and increase the expression level of YAP1. We further confirmed that the circ-Vav3/gga-miR-375/YAP1 axis induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through influencing EMT markers to promote tumorigenesis. Finally, clinical ALV-J-induced tumor livers were collected to detect core gene expression levels to provide a proof to the concluded tumorigenic mechanism. Together, our results suggest that circ-Vav3/gga-miR-375/YAP1 axis is another regulator of tumorigenesis.","['Zhang, Xinheng', 'Yan, Yiming', 'Lin, Wencheng', 'Li, Aijun', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Lei, Xiaoya', 'Dai, Zhenkai', 'Li, Xinjian', 'Li, Hongxin', 'Chen, Weiguo', 'Chen, Feng', 'Ma, Jingyun', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Zhang X', 'Yan Y', 'Lin W', 'Li A', 'Zhang H', 'Lei X', 'Dai Z', 'Li X', 'Li H', 'Chen W', 'Chen F', 'Ma J', 'Xie Q']",,"['a College of Animal Science , South China Agricultural University , Guangzhou , P.

METHODS: Collagenase type VII (0.5 U) was injected stereotaxically into right globus pallidus to induce ICH model. One hundred and twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups according to a random number table, including normal group (n=40), ICH model group (n=40) and BYHWD group (n=40), respectively. After ICH, the rats in the BYHWD group were intragastrically administered with BYHWD (4.36 g/kg) once a day for 21 days, while the rats in ICH group were administered with equal volume of distilled water for 21 days, respectively. Double immunolabeling was performed for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+) nuclei. The expression of GFAP and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The astrocytes with hypertrophied morphology around the hematoma was observed on day 3 after ICH. The number of GFAP positive cells and GFAP mRNA levels increased notably on day 3 and reached the peak on day 14 post-ICH (P<0.01). PCNA+/GFAP+ nuclei were observed around the hematoma and reached the peak on day 14 post-ICH (P<0.01). In addition, LIF-positive astrocytes and LIF mRNA level in the hemorrhagic region increased significantly till day 14 post-ICH (P<0.01). However, BYHWD not only reduced the number of PCNA(+)/GFAP(+) nuclei, but also decreased GFAP and LIF levels (P<0.05).

The optimal post-remission therapy (PRT) in younger patients within this group after first complete remission (CR1) remains to be determined. We report a retrospective evaluation of PRT approaches in 223 patients under the age of 60 years old with intermediate-risk AML in CR1. Patients receiving allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) obtained improved overall survival (OS) than patients who treated with chemotherapy (5-year 61.6 +/- 5.2% versus 41.1 +/- 5.3%, p = 0.004). AlloHSCT led to fewer cases of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.14, p < 0.001) and increased the relapse-free survival (RFS, HR 0.45, p < 0.001). With alloHSCT, the outcome of patients who reached negative minimal residual disease after 2 cycles of consolidation could be further improved with an increased OS of 66% and RFS of 61%. Nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) mutation negative, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) double mutation negative, and FLT-3 internal tandem duplication negative (NPM1(mut-neg)CEBPA(dm-neg)FLT3-ITD(neg)) patients had a significantly longer RFS with alloHSCT. In conclusion, our results provide additional evidence that alloHSCT is preferential PRT in patients with intermediate-risk AML that are under the age of 60 years old in CR1.","['Zhang, Ying', 'Zhang, Yimin', 'Chen, Qi', 'Tang, Gusheng', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Hu, Xiaoxia']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen Q', 'Tang G', 'Zhang W', 'Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Hu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2719-3805'],"['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Health Statistics, Second Military Medical University, No. 800 Xiangyin Road, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China. hu_xiaoxia@126.com.']",['eng'],"['81770160/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81470321/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81270567/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81530047/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017BR012/Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Oustanding Leaders in', 'Medical Disciplines in Shanghai']",['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3584-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3584-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Apr;98(4):997-1007. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3584-2.

Diagnosis of lymphoblastic/leukaemia lymphoma was made in 2015 by morphological and histological study. The patient underwent Moroccan protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (MARALL) from 2015 to 2017 and achieved complete remission. One year later, the patient developed an anterior mediastinal mass, relapse was suspected, but the surgical biopsy was performed and histological, the mass showed thymoma. CONCLUSION: At the time of diagnosis of thymoma for a patient treated for T-lymphoblastic/leukaemia lymphoma it is necessary to eliminate a relapse because the distinction between thymoma and T-lymphoblastic/leukaemia lymphoma is sometimes difficult, and the association is possible.","['Bendari, Mounia', 'Bencharef, Hanaa', 'Khoubila, Nisrine', 'Cherkaoui, Siham', 'Lamchahab, Mouna', 'Madani, Abdellah', 'Rachid, Mohamed', 'Qachouh, Meryem', 'Oukache, Bouchra', 'Quessar, Asmaa']","['Bendari M', 'Bencharef H', 'Khoubila N', 'Cherkaoui S', 'Lamchahab M', 'Madani A', 'Rachid M', 'Qachouh M', 'Oukache B', 'Quessar A']",,"['Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Center, Hospital 20 Aout Pediatric, Casablanca, Morocco.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC6311490,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/01/05 06:01,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2018.396 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-6-2373 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2018 Dec 14;6(12):2373-2375. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.396. eCollection 2018 Dec 20.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Thymoma', 'Thymus']",,,20181214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, it has been proven to be reactive in various non-lymphoid cells and tissue and different types of neoplasms. AIM: To evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of CD10 in malignant thyroid neoplasms and different benign lesions and to assess whether CD10 can be used as a malignancy marker in thyroid pathology or not. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 83 archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 83 cases of malignant thyroid neoplasms and different benign lesions. The samples were immunohistochemically analysed for CD10 expression. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: CD10 was expressed in 91% of the studied malignant thyroid neoplasms and 58% of benign thyroid lesions. It was expressed in 26 of 28 (92.9%) conventional papillary carcinomas, ten of 10 (100%) follicular variants of papillary carcinoma, seven of nine (77.8%) minimally invasive follicular carcinomas, two of three (66.7%) widely invasive follicular carcinomas, and seven of 7 (100%) undifferentiated carcinomas, seven of 11 (66.7%) adenomatous nodules and eight of 15 (53.3%) follicular adenomas. No statistically significant correlations were detected between CD10 expression and patients' age, sex, lymph node metastasis, tumour stage and capsular invasion. CONCLUSION: CD10 shows strong sensitivity (91.2%) and moderate specificity (42.3%) in the diagnosis of malignancy overall and shows strong sensitivity (86.4%) and moderate specificity (42.3%) in the diagnosis of malignancy in the follicular-patterned lesions. So, CD10 might be useful in differentiating malignant from benign thyroid lesions (good positive test) and in the diagnosis of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma.","['Gabal, Samia Mohamed', 'Salem, Mostafa Mohamed', 'Mostafa, Rasha Ramadan', 'Abdelsalam, Shaimaa Mohamed']","['Gabal SM', 'Salem MM', 'Mostafa RR', 'Abdelsalam SM']",,"['Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC6311489,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/01/05 06:01,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2018.456 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-6-2295 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2018 Dec 19;6(12):2295-2300. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.456. eCollection 2018 Dec 20.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Benign thyroid lesions', 'CD10', 'Immunohistochemical', 'Malignant thyroid neoplasms']",,,20181219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During CMA, the HSC70 chaperone carries target proteins endowed with a KFERQ-like motif to the lysosomal receptor LAMP2A, which then translocate them into lysosomes for degradation. In the present study, we scrutinized the mechanisms underlying the response and resistance to Azacytidine (Aza) in MDS/AML cell lines and bone marrow CD34(+) blasts from MDS/AML patients. In engineered Aza-resistant MDS cell lines and some AML cell lines, we identified a profound defect in CMA linked to the absence of LAMP2A. LAMP2 deficiency was responsible for Aza resistance and hypersensitivity to lysosome and autophagy inhibitors. Accordingly, gain of function of LAMP2 in deficient cells or loss of function in LAMP2-expressing cells rendered them sensitive or resistant to Aza, respectively. A strict correlation was observed between the absence of LAMP2, resistance to Aza and sensitivity to lysosome inhibitors. Low levels of LAMP2 expression in CD34(+) blasts from MDS/AML patients correlated with lack of sensitivity to Aza and were predictive of poor overall survival. We propose that CD34(+)/LAMP2(Low) patients at diagnosis or who become CD34(+)/LAMP2(Low) during the course of treatment with Aza might benefit from a lysosome inhibitor already used in the clinic.","['Dubois, Alix', 'Furstoss, Nathan', 'Calleja, Anne', 'Zerhouni, Marwa', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Savy, Coline', 'Marchetti, Sandrine', 'Hamouda, Mohamed Amine', 'Boulakirba, Sonia', 'Orange,

Growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor responsible for controlling secretory cell differentiation in the small intestine and colon. GFI1 plays a significant role in the development of human malignancies, including leukemia, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. However, the role of GFI1 in colorectal cancer progression is largely unknown. Our results demonstrate that RNA and protein expression of GFI1 are reduced in advanced-stage nonmucinous colorectal cancer. Subcutaneous tumor xenograft models demonstrated that the reexpression of GFI1 in 4 different human colorectal cancer cell lines inhibits tumor growth. To further investigate the role of Gfi1 in de novo colorectal tumorigenesis, we developed transgenic mice harboring a deletion of Gfi1 in the colon driven by CDX2-cre (Gfi1(F/F); CDX2-cre) and crossed them with Apc(Min/+) mice (Apc(Min/+); Gfi1(F/F); CDX2-cre). Loss of Gfi1 significantly increased the total number of colorectal adenomas compared with littermate controls with an APC mutation alone. Furthermore, we found that compound (Apc(Min/+); Gfi1(F/F); CDX2-cre) mice develop larger adenomas, invasive carcinoma, as well as hyperplastic lesions expressing the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A, a feature that has not been previously described in APC-mutant tumors in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GFI1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer, where deficiency of Gfi1 promotes malignancy in the colon. IMPLICATIONS: These findings reveal that GFI1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal tumorigenesis.","['Chen, Min-Shan', 'Lo, Yuan-Hung', 'Chen, Xi', 'Williams, Christopher S', 'Donnelly, Jessica M', 'Criss, Zachary K 2nd', 'Patel, Shreena', 'Butkus, Joann M', 'Dubrulle, Julien', 'Finegold, Milton J', 'Shroyer, Noah F']","['Chen MS', 'Lo YH', 'Chen X', 'Williams CS', 'Donnelly JM', 'Criss ZK 2nd', 'Patel S', 'Butkus JM', 'Dubrulle J', 'Finegold MJ', 'Shroyer NF']",,"['Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Miami, Miami, Florida.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine Graduate Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Texas.', 'Susquehanna University, Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania.', 'Integrated Microscopy Core, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.

Mutational analysis and immunophenotyping have been proposed as potential tools for diagnosis; however, they have not been formally assessed in combination. We aimed to investigate the clinical utility of these technologies by performing targeted sequencing, in parallel with current gold standard techniques, on consecutive samples referred for investigation of monocytosis over a 2-year period (N = 283). Results were correlated with the morphological diagnosis and objective outcome measures, including overall survival (OS) and longitudinal blood counts. Somatic mutations were detected in 79% of patients, being invariably identified in those with a confirmed diagnosis (99%) but also in 57% of patients with nondiagnostic bone marrow features. The OS in nondiagnostic mutated patients was indistinguishable from those with CMML (P = .118) and significantly worse than in unmutated patients (P = .0002). On multivariate analysis, age, ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, NRAS, and RUNX1 mutations retained significance. Furthermore, the presence of a mutation was associated with a progressive decrease in hemoglobin/platelet levels and increasing monocyte counts compared with mutation-negative patients. Of note, the immunophenotypic features of nondiagnostic mutated patients were comparable to CMML patients, and the presence of aberrant CD56 was highly specific for detecting a mutation. Overall, somatic mutations are detected at high frequency in patients referred with a monocytosis, irrespective of diagnosis. In those without a World Health Organization-defined diagnosis, the mutation spectrum, immunophenotypic features, and OS are indistinguishable from CMML patients, and these patients should be managed as such.","['Cargo, Catherine', 'Cullen, Matthew', 'Taylor, Jan', 'Short, Mike', 'Glover, Paul', 'Van Hoppe, Suzan', 'Smith, Alex', 'Evans, Paul', 'Crouch, Simon']","['Cargo C', 'Cullen M', 'Taylor J', 'Short M', 'Glover P', 'Van Hoppe S', 'Smith A', 'Evans P', 'Crouch S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5185-0190'],"[""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; and."", 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42688-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-08-867333 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 21;133(12):1325-1334. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-08-867333.

These new medicines are indicative of the changes we can anticipate in the practice of medicine in the near future. Despite their promise, they pose challenges for introduction into the healthcare sector in South Africa (SA), including: (i) that they are technologically demanding and their manufacture is resource intensive; (ii) that the regulatory system is underdeveloped and likely to be challenged by ethical, legal and social requirements that accompany these new therapies; and (iii) that costs are likely to be prohibitive, at least initially, and before economies of scale take effect.

Numerous studies have shown that disruption of circadian rhythm may increase risk for malignant, psychiatric, metabolic, and other diseases. RESULTS: Extending our recent findings of oscillating cytosine modifications (osc-modCs) in mice, in this study, we show that osc-modCs are also prevalent in human neutrophils. Osc-modCs may play a role in gene regulation, can explain parts of intra- and inter-individual epigenetic variation, and are signatures of aging. Finally, we show that osc-modCs are linked to three complex diseases and provide a new interpretation of cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that loss of balance between cytosine methylation and demethylation during the circadian cycle can be a potential mechanism for complex disease. Additional experiments, however, are required to investigate the possible involvement of confounding effects, such as hidden cellular heterogeneity. Circadian rhythmicity, one of the key adaptations of life forms on Earth, may contribute to frailty later in life.","['Oh, Gabriel', 'Koncevicius, Karolis', 'Ebrahimi, Sasha', 'Carlucci, Matthew', 'Groot, Daniel Erik', 'Nair, Akhil', 'Zhang, Aiping', 'Krisciunas, Algimantas', 'Oh, Edward S', 'Labrie, Viviane', 'Wong, Albert H C', 'Gordevicius, Juozas', 'Jia, Peixin', 'Susic, Miki', 'Petronis, Art']","['Oh G', 'Koncevicius K', 'Ebrahimi S', 'Carlucci M', 'Groot DE', 'Nair A', 'Zhang A', 'Krisciunas A', 'Oh ES', 'Labrie V', 'Wong AHC', 'Gordevicius J', 'Jia P', 'Susic M', 'Petronis A']",,"['The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory, The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada. art.petronis@camh.ca.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. art.petronis@camh.ca.']",['eng'],"['R01 MH105409/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'IGH-155180/CIHR/Canada', 'PJT 148719/CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-119451/CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-133496/CIHR/Canada', '1R01MH105409-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NTC-15408/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,['8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)'],IM,"['Aging/*metabolism', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Schizophrenia/metabolism']",PMC6317262,,2019/01/05 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13059-018-1608-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-018-1608-9 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2019 Jan 3;20(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s13059-018-1608-9.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aging', '*Circadian', '*DNA modification', '*Diabetes', '*Differentiation', '*Disease', '*Epigenetics', '*Leukemia', '*Methylation', '*Schizophrenia']",,,20190103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the extended duration of TKI administration, treatment discontinuation has been increasingly sought. METHODS: Medical records of 100 patients with CML who were in MR(4.5) and discontinued their TKI outside clinical trials were reviewed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 5-112 months) after discontinuation, 35% and 17% lost MR(4.5) and major molecular response (MMR), respectively. Only six patients lost MMR 12 months or more after discontinuation. Loss of MR(4.5) was observed in 29% and 7% of patients with sustained MR(4.5) duration of more than 2 and 6 years before discontinuation, respectively. By univariate analysis, there was a higher risk of loss of MR(4.5) for patients who were treated for less than 87 months, received second or subsequent line TKI, never received interferon, or those with sustained MR(4.5) for less than 6 years. By multivariate analysis, sustained MR(4.5) for 6 years or more was the only significant predictor for durable response. Overall, 30% of patients who discontinued while in MR(4.5) were retreated with 93% regaining MR(4.5) at a median of 5 months. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that under proper conditions, treatment discontinuation is feasible outside of clinical trial setting. MR(4.5) duration of 6 years or more before discontinuation is associated with very low risk of loss of MR(4.5).","['Chamoun, Kamal', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Atallah, Rami', 'Gonzalez, Graciela Nogueras', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Daver, Naval', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Chamoun K', 'Kantarjian H', 'Atallah R', 'Gonzalez GN', 'Issa GC', 'Rios MB', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Borthakur G', 'Ravandi F', 'Jain N', 'Daver N', 'Konopleva M', 'DiNardo CD', 'Kadia T', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Jabbour E', 'Cortes J']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Dropouts', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6318861,,2019/01/05 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/01/05 06:00'],"['2018/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0686-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0686-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jan 3;12(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0686-1.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*MR4.5', '*TKI discontinuation']",,,20190103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BK viruria alone can also occur in up to 100%. BKHC can lead to severe morbidity in stem cell-transplanted patients, but data about this disease is limited. Consequently, we conducted a prospective unicentric non-interventional trial on BKHC as well as BK viruria after first adult allogeneic stem cell transplantation with a follow-up time of 1 year after inpatient treatment. Between November 2013 and December 2015, we were able to include 40 adult patients with a mean age of 52.8 years. Twenty-seven (67.5%) of these patients were male and 13 (32.5%) were female. Acute myeloid leukaemia was the most frequent underlying disease (n = 15; 37.5%). Only 1 patient developed BKHC during inpatient treatment (n = 1; 2.5%), but BK viruria was frequent (n = 11; 27.5%) during inpatient treatment as well as in the follow-up time (n = 14; 35%). Interestingly, BK viruria was significantly associated with mucositis (p = 0.038) and number of transfused platelet concentrates (p = 0.001).

We examined the prognostic impact of the percentage of erythroid cells in the bone marrow (bmery) in 2453 primary untreated MDS patients in a retrospective multi-center analysis. Bmery were quantified in bone marrow smears at the time of diagnosis and were correlated with overall survival (OS) and AML evolution. We identified three distinct risk categories: ""< = 10% bmery"" (poor), ""11-25 or >45% bmery"" (intermediate), and ""26-45% bmery"" (good) with distinct OS of 23, 40 and 48 months, respectively. The percentage of bmery showed prognostic significance concerning OS (Dxy = 0.08, p < 0.001) and AML-free survival (Dxy = 0.15, p < 0.001). Considering the IPSS-R by stratification, the Dxy were 0.09 for survival, and 0.18 for transformation (p < 0.001). Added to the IPSS-R, bmery enhances the prognostic power for both survival (Dxy = 0.39) and time to AML (Dxy = 0.59). Survival and time to AML differ in MDS according to the percentage of bmery. The best outcome was found in those who had normal or near normal bmery counts. Moreover, adding bmery as differentiating feature to the IPSS-R may enhance its prognostic significance.","['Neukirchen-Strapatsas, Judith', 'Tuechler, Heinz', 'Porta, Matteo Della', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Sapena, Rosa', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Valent, Peter', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Bennett, John M']","['Neukirchen-Strapatsas J', 'Tuechler H', 'Porta MD', 'Fenaux P', 'Guerci A', 'Haas R', 'Rossi M', 'Sapena R', 'Sperr WR', 'Strupp C', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Valent P', 'Germing U', 'Bennett JM']",,"['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, Germany.

To determine how epigenetic systems can produce variable, yet stable cellular outcomes, understanding the collaboration between these modifications is the key. A recent study by Yamagata and Kobayashi revealed the direct interplay between the regulation of two epigenetic modifications: DNA de-methylation by TET2 and histone H3-K36 methylation. Mechanistically, this finding could explain how cells are protected from oncogenesis by maintaining the integrity of active transcription. The recent identification of epigenetic modifier mutations in leukaemia suggested that it is not just the turning 'on' and 'off' of particular transcriptional events that causes disease occurrence, but rather it is the aberration in epigenetic regulation, i.e. the timing and duration of the activation/inactivation of these transcripts. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how epigenetic interplays tune transcription will be the new perspective for disease research.","['Furuya, Kanji', 'Ikura, Masae', 'Ikura, Tsuyoshi']","['Furuya K', 'Ikura M', 'Ikura T']",,"['Laboratory of Genome Maintenance.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Regulatory Network, Department of Genome Biology, Radiation Biology Center, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Regulatory Network, Department of Genome Biology, Radiation Biology Center, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/03/29 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5272458 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvy124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2019 Apr 1;165(4):297-299. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvy124.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in DC cultures were measured by flow cytometry. Obtained results indicated activation of pDCs population, where a significant increase in production of the IFN-gamma was shown. Meanwhile, a decrease in production of IFN-gamma and increase in production of IL-10 were shown in mDCs; the main population responsible for antigens presentation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of concomitant TKI-PPI receipt and its impact on survival and therapy discontinuation in older adults with cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data for the years 2007 through 2012. In total, 12,538 patients with lung cancer, renal cell cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia, liver cancer, or pancreatic cancer were included. The primary exposure variable was concomitant receipt of TKI-PPI, defined as at least 30 days of PPI use in the first 90 days from the start of the TKI (exposure period). The outcomes measured were overall survival and discontinuation of therapy in 90 days and 1 year after the end of the exposure period. Cox proportional-hazards regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to evaluate the association between exposure and outcome. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of TKI-PPI receipt was 22.7%. Predictors that were associated with increased use included polypharmacy and prior PPI receipt. TKI-PPI use decreased survival in 90 days (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.28) and in 1 year (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.18) but was not associated with discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 in 4 older adults with cancer who receive TKIs also receive PPIs concomitantly, and concomitant use is associated with an increased risk of death. Concerted efforts to manage medications are needed to identify and reduce the receipt of PPIs when TKIs are initiated.","['Sharma, Manvi', 'Holmes, Holly M', 'Mehta, Hemalkumar B', 'Chen, Hua', 'Aparasu, Rajender R', 'Shih, Ya-Chen T', 'Giordano, Sharon H', 'Johnson, Michael L']","['Sharma M', 'Holmes HM', 'Mehta HB', 'Chen H', 'Aparasu RR', 'Shih YT', 'Giordano SH', 'Johnson ML']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4221-7801'],"['Department of Pharmacy Administration, The University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi.', 'Division of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Surgery, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Health Services Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Health Services Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Deprescriptions', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Peptic Ulcer/drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'United States']",PMC6420393,['NIHMS998666'],2019/01/04 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31917 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Apr 1;125(7):1155-1162. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31917.

Genetic variation in miR-1206 of both derived and neighborhood SNPs process genes will contribute to the predisposition to cancer. The role of those with the risk of CML has not been extensively studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether polymorphisms in rs2114358 in pre-miRNAs process genes contribute to the risk of CML. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of March 2016 to October 2017 in Khartoum state teaching hospitals. The study population included a total of 420 patients who were previously diagnosed of having CML and 220 cancer-free controls of both gender and were of the same age range. Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration samples were collected from patients (254 males, 166 females; median age 58.5 years, range from less than 50 and above 50 years old) and investigated after written informed consent was obtained. Patients were in chronic phase (n=212), accelerated phase (n=125), and blast (n=83). All the patients were under treatment using chemotherapy regiments. The rs2114358 SNP in pre-miRNA was selected for genotyping. RESULTS: The genotyping success rate was 98.3%. Genotype frequencies of the derived SNP and the neighborhood rs2114358 of miR-1206 compared to the controls were significantly different under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P=0.0001 and 0.0001 respectively). Significant differences were found in allele distributions of this SNP (P<0.01 and P<0.01). In total, the derived variant C allele of rs2114358 (OR=0.168, 95% CI=0.13-0.22) and G allele of neighborhood rs2114358 (OR=0.561, 95% CI=0.44-0.72) in patients' group were associated with an increased risk of CML compared to a control group. Patients with rs2114358 CC genotype (P = 0.0001) or TC (P = 0.0001) and the neighborhood rs2114358 GA genotype (P = 0.0460) or GG (P = 0.0093) were obviously much higher than that of the TT and AA genotype's patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we discovered the association of SNP rs2114358 in miR-1206 with the risk of CML patients, though more investigations are still required to understand the regulative mechanisms of this miR SNP with the target genes resulting in its dysregulation.","['Hassan, Fathelrahman Mahdi']",['Hassan FM'],,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, College of Applied Medical Science, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Microrna,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,"['0 (MIRN1206 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']",,,2019/01/04 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['MIRNA-EPUB-95555 [pii]', '10.2174/2211536608666190102143439 [doi]']",ppublish,Microrna. 2019;8(3):248-252. doi: 10.2174/2211536608666190102143439.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allele', '*CML risk', '*SNP rs2114358', '*genotypes', '*leukemia', '*polymorphism.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A primary example, hematopoiesis, classically represented by a hierarchical tree with a stem cell at the apex and more lineage restricted cells following each bifurcation has recently been shown to be capable of more adaptable fate decisions. Future research will identify key molecules underpinning this more adaptable or continuous model of hematopoiesis potentially leading to improved engineering of blood cells and therapies for malignant disease. The spatio-temporal, cell specific and exquisite reliance on gene dosage attributed to the HOX family promoted them as candidate master regulators of hierarchical hematopoiesis. Recent discoveries in the need to stimulate or retain HOX expression during engineered human hematopoiesis, supported by similar studies in mice and other developmental models, reinforces their importance at the single cell level. Likewise, dysregulation of HOX in single cells can result in blood cancers such as leukemia. It will be of interest to see what additional roles HOX family members and their regulators including morphogens, epigenetic modifiers and noncoding RNAs play in this evolving field and if these master regulators can be further harnessed for clinical benefit.","['Collins, Emma M', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['Collins EM', 'Thompson A']",,"['University of Nottingham, Division of Cancer and Stem cells, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences University Park, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['180206at [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.180206at [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2018;62(11-12):847-856. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.180206at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have re-engineered six anti-human TfR1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies into fully human scFv2-Fcgamma1 and IgG1 antibodies. We selected the more promising candidate (H7), based on its ability to inhibit TfR1-mediated iron-loaded transferrin internalization in Raji cells (B-cell lymphoma). The H7 antibody displayed nanomolar affinity for its target in both formats (scFv2-Fcgamma1 and IgG1), but cross-reacted with mouse TfR1 only in the scFv2-Fc format. H7 reduced the intracellular labile iron pool and, contrary to what has been observed with previously described anti-TfR1 antibodies, upregulated TfR1 level in Raji cells. H7 scFv2-Fc format elimination half-life was similar in FcRn knock-out and wild type mice, suggesting that TfR1 recycling contributes to prevent H7 elimination in vivo. In vitro, H7 inhibited the growth of erythroleukemia and B-cell lymphoma cell lines (IC50 0.1 microg/mL) and induced their apoptosis. Moreover, the Im9 B-cell lymphoma cell line, which is resistant to apoptosis induced by rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody), was sensitive to H7. In vivo, tumor regression was observed in nude mice bearing ERY-1 erythroleukemia cell xenografts treated with H7 through a mechanism that involved iron deprivation and antibody-dependent cytotoxic effector functions. Therefore, targeting TfR1 using the fully human anti-TfR1 H7 is a promising tool for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Neiveyans, Madeline', 'Melhem, Rana', 'Arnoult, Christophe', 'Bourquard, Thomas', 'Jarlier, Marta', 'Busson, Muriel', 'Laroche, Adrien', 'Cerutti, Martine', 'Pugniere, Martine', 'Ternant, David', 'Gaborit, Nadege', 'Chardes, Thierry', 'Poupon, Anne', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, Valerie', 'Pelegrin, Andre', 'Poul, Marie-Alix']","['Neiveyans M', 'Melhem R', 'Arnoult C', 'Bourquard T', 'Jarlier M', 'Busson M', 'Laroche A', 'Cerutti M', 'Pugniere M', 'Ternant D', 'Gaborit N', 'Chardes T', 'Poupon A', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Pelegrin A', 'Poul MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9670-711X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5936-4026', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6447-6735', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7157-064X']","['a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'c CNRS , GICC UMR 7292 , Tours , France.', 'd Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.', 'e UMR INRA CNRS Physiologie de la reproduction et des comportements, Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours , Nouzilly , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'f CNRS, UPS3044 Saint-Christol-Lez-Ales , France.', 'g PP2I, Plateforme Proteomique et Interactions Moleculaires , IRCM.', 'c CNRS , GICC UMR 7292 , Tours , France.', 'd Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.', 'h CHRU de Tours, Department of medical pharmacology , Tours , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'e UMR INRA CNRS Physiologie de la reproduction et des comportements, Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours , Nouzilly , France.', 'c CNRS , GICC UMR 7292 , Tours , France.', 'd Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier ; INSERM, U1194, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier , France.', 'b ICM , Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (Tfrc protein, mouse)']",,"['Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/immunology/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetulus', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*immunology', '*Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology']",PMC6512944,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/19420862.2018.1564510 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2019 Apr;11(3):593-605. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2018.1564510.

Future strategies aim to de-intensify treatment and reduce toxicity for children with a low risk of relapse and intensify treatment for children with high-risk disease. For metastatic WT, response of lung nodules to chemotherapy is used as a marker to modify treatment intensity. For recurrent WT, a unified approach based on the use of agents that were not used for primary therapy is being introduced. Irinotecan is being explored as a new strategy in both metastatic and relapsed WT. Introduction of biology-driven approaches to risk stratification and new drug treatments has been slower in WT than in some other childhood cancers. While several new biological pathways have been identified recently in WT, their individual rarity has hampered their translation into clinical utility. Identification of robust prognostic factors requires extensive international collaborative studies because of the low proportion who relapse or die. Molecular profiling studies are in progress that should ultimately improve both risk classification and signposting to more targeted therapies for the small group for whom current therapies fail. Accrual of patients with WT to early-phase trials has been low, and the efficacy of these new agents has so far been very disappointing. Better in vitro model systems to test mechanistic dependence are needed so available new agents can be more rationally prioritized for recruitment of children with WT to early-phase trials.","['Oostveen, Radna Minou', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy']","['Oostveen RM', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9674-8870', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-9475']","['UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, UK. m.oostveen@ucl.ac.uk.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['W1090/Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity', 'C1188/A4614/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', ""CCLGA 2017 02/Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group""]","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Wilms Tumor/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40272-018-0323-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40272-018-0323-z [pii]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2019 Feb;21(1):1-13. doi: 10.1007/s40272-018-0323-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined whether the D-index can predict the onset of various infections in patients with febrile neutropenia (FN). METHODS: We retrospectively investigated FN events in consecutive patients aged < 65 years who were treated for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia at our institution. We collected data on all FN events during chemotherapy and evaluated the association of FN severity with infectious events. RESULTS: This study included 35 patients (18 women and 17 men; median age, 51 years [range 18-65 years]) with 122 FN events. The response rate to induction chemotherapy was 60% (21/35), and all but one patient survived the treatment. The D-index did not predict FN onset. However, in multivariate analysis, high-dose cytarabine and total D-index were statistically significant explanatory factors for microbiological-proven infections. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that diabetes mellitus is the only risk factor for FN onset. Furthermore, older age, consolidation therapy, and cumulative D-index (c-D-index) were risk factors for prolonged FN. The FN period was the longest in patients with respiratory infections. CONCLUSION: The D-index did not predict the onset of infection. However, FN duration might be prolonged during consolidation therapy in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus, and it is important to manage respiratory infections. These findings indicate the c-D-index is a useful tool to predict prolonged FN.","['Kubo, Hiroyuki', 'Imataki, Osamu', 'Kubo, Yukiko Hamasaki', 'Uemura, Makiko', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu']","['Kubo H', 'Imataki O', 'Kubo YH', 'Uemura M', 'Kadowaki N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5332-1316'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-018-01384-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-018-01384-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 May;24(5):590-595. doi: 10.1007/s10147-018-01384-9.

The anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 CAR-T cell therapy has been remarkably successful against refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and a complete remission rate as high as 90% was observed, in both children and adults. Although the achievement of clinical efficacy using CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors has encountered several obstacles that were associated with the multiple mechanisms contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, investigators are exploring more optimized approaches to improve the efficiency of CAR-T in solid tumors. In addition, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity following CAR-T cell therapy can be severe or even fatal; therefore, the management of these toxicities is significant. Herein, we briefly review the structure of CAR-T and some novel CAR designs, the clinical application of CAR-T cell therapies, as well as the assessment and management of toxicities.","['Han, Xiao', 'Wang, Yao', 'Han, Wei-Dong']","['Han X', 'Wang Y', 'Han WD']",,"[""Molecular & Immunological Department, Bio-therapeutic Department, The General Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100853, China."", ""Molecular & Immunological Department, Bio-therapeutic Department, The General Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100853, China."", ""Molecular & Immunological Department, Bio-therapeutic Department, The General Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100853, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chronic Dis Transl Med,Chronic diseases and translational medicine,101679934,,,,PMC6309024,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/01/04 06:01,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.08.002 [doi]', 'S2095-882X(18)30044-6 [pii]']",epublish,Chronic Dis Transl Med. 2018 Sep 18;4(4):225-243. doi: 10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.08.002. eCollection 2018 Dec.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell', 'Hematologic malignancies', 'Solid tumor', 'Toxicities']",,,20180918,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this, we performed cross-trait linkage disequilibrium (LD)-score regression of multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, totalling 11,734 cases and 29,468 controls. A significant genetic correlation between these two B-cell malignancies was shown (Rg = 0.4, P = 0.0046). Furthermore, four of the 45 known CLL risk loci were shown to associate with MM risk and five of the 23 known MM risk loci associate with CLL risk. By integrating eQTL, Hi-C and ChIP-seq data, we show that these pleiotropic risk loci are enriched for B-cell regulatory elements and implicate B-cell developmental genes. These data identify shared biological pathways influencing the development of CLL and, MM and further our understanding of the aetiological basis of these B-cell malignancies.","['Went, Molly', 'Sud,

Few clinical cases have reported the progression of ET to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with the expression of the BCR-ABL gene. This report describes such a case and includes a review of other reported cases of CML co-occurring with BCR-ABL-negative chronic MPDs. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old woman was diagnosed with ET in 2007. Cytogenetic testing was negative for expression of the JAK2 or BCR-ABL1 genes. Eight years later, in January 2015, she presented with excessive fatigue, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 24,700 per mL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl, and a platelet count of 557,000 per mL, with blasts and basophils in the blood film. Cytogenetic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed a 9: 22 chromosomal translocation (Philadelphia chromosome), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detected the expression of the BCR-ABL gene, confirming a diagnosis of CML. In February 2015, first-line therapy commenced with nilotinib, which was changed to imatinib after three months. During the following nine months, qRT-PCR confirmed a trend to deep molecular remission (MR5). However, she developed early myelofibrosis, and myelosuppressive therapy was resumed. CONCLUSIONS This rare case highlights the importance of cytogenetic testing in cases of CMPD that transform to CML, not only to confirm the diagnosis but to plan treatment, as Philadelphia chromosome-positive and -negative cases differ in their management.","['Hassankrishnamurthy, Shruthimurthy', 'Mody, Mayur D', 'Kota, Vamsi K']","['Hassankrishnamurthy S', 'Mody MD', 'Kota VK']",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, JSS Medical College, Mysore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*etiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6325661,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['911854 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.911854 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Jan 3;20:10-14. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.911854.,,,,,,,,20190103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many challenges toward the routine clinical application of CBA remain. In a retrospective study of 5290 patients with available CBA data, we explored both clinicobiological associations and the clinical impact of CK in CLL. We found that patients with >/=5 abnormalities, defined as high-CK, exhibit uniformly dismal clinical outcomes, independently of clinical stage, TP53 aberrations (deletion of chromosome 17p and/or TP53 mutations [TP53abs]), and the expression of somatically hypermutated (M-CLL) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable genes. Thus, they contrasted with CK cases with 3 or 4 aberrations (low-CK and intermediate-CK, respectively) who followed aggressive disease courses only in the presence of TP53abs. At the other end of the spectrum, patients with CK and +12,+19 displayed an exceptionally indolent profile. Building upon CK, TP53abs, and immunoglobulin heavy variable gene somatic hypermutation status, we propose a novel hierarchical model in which patients with high-CK exhibit the worst prognosis, whereas those with mutated CLL lacking CK or TP53abs, as well as CK with +12,+19, show the longest overall survival. Thus, CK should not be axiomatically considered unfavorable in CLL, representing a heterogeneous group with variable clinical behavior. High-CK with >/=5 chromosomal aberrations emerges as prognostically adverse, independent of other biomarkers. Prospective clinical validation is warranted before ultimately incorporating high-CK in risk stratification of CLL.","['Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Jeromin, Sabine', 'Iskas, Michalis', 'Puiggros, Anna', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Xochelli, Aliki', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Baran-Marszak, Fanny', 'Stalika, Evangelia', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Durechova, Kristina', 'Papaioannou, George', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Iliakis, Theodoros', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Calasanz, M Jose', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Moreno, Carolina', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Leeksma, Alexander C', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Podgornik, Helena', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Davi, Fred', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Athanasiadou, Anastasia', 'Oscier, David', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Baliakas P', 'Jeromin S', 'Iskas M', 'Puiggros A', 'Plevova K', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Davis Z', 'Rigolin GM', 'Visentin A', 'Xochelli A', 'Delgado J', 'Baran-Marszak F', 'Stalika E', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Durechova K', 'Papaioannou G', 'Eclache V', 'Dimou M', 'Iliakis T', 'Collado R', 'Doubek M', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Moreno C', 'Jarosova M', 'Leeksma AC', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Podgornik H', 'Cymbalista F', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Trentin L', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Davi F', 'Ghia P', 'Kater AP', 'Cuneo A', 'Pospisilova S', 'Espinet B', 'Athanasiadou A', 'Oscier D', 'Haferlach C', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3752-2067', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

PLZF loss induces an in vitro phenotype of castration resistance and enzalutamide resistance. The association of low expression of PLZF and clinical outcomes is unclear. METHODS: We assessed PLZF mRNA expression in patients diagnosed with primary prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; n = 254) and the Physicians' Health Study (PHS; n = 150), as well as in The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 333). We measured PTEN status (using copy numbers and IHC) and transcriptional activation of the MAPK pathway. Patients from HPFS and PHS were followed for metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality (median, 15.3 years; 113 lethal events). RESULTS: PLZF mRNA expression was lower in tumors with PLZF deletions. There was a strong, positive association between intratumoral androgen receptor (AR) signaling and PLZF expression. PLZF expression was also lower in tumors with PTEN loss. Low PLZF expression was associated with higher MAPK signaling. Patients in the lowest quartile of PLZF expression compared with those in the highest quartile were more likely to develop lethal prostate cancer, independent of clinicopathologic features, Gleason score, and AR signaling (odds ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-7.60). CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of the tumor suppressor gene PLZF is associated with a worse prognosis in primary prostate cancer. IMPACT: Suppression of PLZF as a consequence of androgen deprivation may be undesirable. PLZF should be tested as a predictive marker for resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.","['Stopsack, Konrad H', 'Gerke, Travis', 'Tyekucheva, Svitlana', 'Mazzu, Ying Z', 'Lee, Gwo-Shu Mary', 'Chakraborty, Goutam', 'Abida, Wassim', 'Mucci, Lorelei A', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","['Stopsack KH', 'Gerke T', 'Tyekucheva S', 'Mazzu YZ', 'Lee GM', 'Chakraborty G', 'Abida W', 'Mucci LA', 'Kantoff PW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0722-1311', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3119-6507']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

RESULTS: In this study, the development, differentiation, and immunological capability of B cells and their progenitors infected with ALV-J were studied both morphologically and functionally by using a model of ALV-J congenital infection. Compared with posthatch infection, congenital infection of ALV-J resulted in severe immunological tolerance, which was identified as the absence of detectable specific antivirus antibodies. In congenitally infected chickens, immune organs, particularly the bursa of Fabricius, were poorly developed. Moreover, IgM-and IgG-positive cells and total immunoglobulin levels were significantly decreased in these chickens. Large numbers of bursa follicles with no differentiation into cortex and medulla indicated that B cell development was arrested at the early stage. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed that ALV-J blocked the differentiation of CD117(+)chB6(+) B cell progenitors in the bursa of Fabricius. Furthermore, both the humoral immunity and the immunological capability of B cells and their progenitors were significantly suppressed, as assessed by (a) the antibody titres against sheep red blood cells and the Marek's disease virus attenuated serotype 1 vaccine; (b) the proliferative response of B cells against thymus-independent antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the spleen germinal centres; and (c) the capacities for proliferation, differentiation and immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination of B cell progenitors in response to LPS and interleukin-4(IL-4) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that the anergy of B cells in congenitally infected chickens is caused by the developmental arrest and dysfunction of B cell progenitors, which is an important factor for the immunological tolerance induced by ALV-J.","['He, Shuhai', 'Zheng, Gaoying', 'Zhou, Defang', 'Li, Gen', 'Zhu, Mingjun', 'Du, Xusheng', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['He S', 'Zheng G', 'Zhou D', 'Li G', 'Zhu M', 'Du X', 'Zhou J', 'Cheng Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4323-2541'],"[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", 'College of Husbandry and Veterinary, Xinyang Agriculture and Forestry University, Xinyang, 464000, China.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. czqsd@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['31672521/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '31761133002/China-UK Partnership on Global Food Security: Combating Avian', 'Leukosis Virus Subgroup J for Sustainable Poultry Production/International', 'BB/R012865/1/China-UK Partnership on Global Food Security: Combating Avian', 'Leukosis Virus Subgroup J for Sustainable Poultry Production/International', 'SDAIT-11-04/Shandong Modern Agricultural Technology &amp; Industry', 'System/International', '2017/Fund of Shandong ""Double Tops"" Program/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/*congenital/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Bursa of Fabricius/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chickens', '*Clonal Anergy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Poultry Diseases/*congenital/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/immunology/*pathology/virology']",PMC6317241,,2019/01/04 06:00,2019/03/28 06:00,['2019/01/04 06:00'],"['2018/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-018-0463-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-018-0463-9 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Jan 3;16(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s12977-018-0463-9.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Avian leukosis virus subgroup J', '*B cell anergy', '*B cell progenitor', '*Congenital infection', '*Immunological tolerance']",,,20190103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic approach to CLL includes chemotherapeutic regimens and immunotherapy. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity, which is one of the mechanisms activated by the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, depends on the availability and activity of the complement (C) system. The aim was to study the structure of circulating C components and evaluate the importance of C5 structural integrity for C activity in CLL patients. Blood samples were collected from 40 naive CLL patients and 15 normal controls (NC). The Western blot analysis showed abnormal C5 pattern in some CLL patients, while patterns of C3 and C4 were similar in all subjects. Levels of the C activation markers sC5b-9 and C5a were quantified before and after activation via the classical (CP) and alternative (AP) pathways. In patients with abnormal C5, basal levels of sC5b-9 and C5a were increased while activities of the CP and of the CP C5-convertase, the immediate C5-upstream complex, were decreased compared to NC and to patients with normal C5. The data indicate a link between CP activation and apparent C5 alterations in CLL. This provides a potential prognostic tool that may personalize therapy by identifying a sub-group of CLL patients who display an abnormal C5 pattern, high basal levels of sC5b-9 and C5a, and impaired CP activity, and are likely to be less responsive to immunotherapy due to compromised CP activity.","['Michelis, Regina', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Barhoum, Masad', 'Shehadeh, Mona', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Stemer, Galia', 'Dally, Najib', 'Rahimi-Levene, Naomi', 'Yuklea, Mona', 'Braester, Andrei']","['Michelis R', 'Tadmor T', 'Barhoum M', 'Shehadeh M', 'Shvidel L', 'Aviv A', 'Stemer G', 'Dally N', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Yuklea M', 'Braester A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3513-9016', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3435-8612']","['The Institute for Medical Research, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine in the Galilee, Bar Ilan University, Safed, Israel.', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Ziv Medical Center, Zefat, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine in the Galilee, Bar Ilan University, Safed, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (SC5b-9 protein complex)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Complement C3-C5 Convertases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Complement Activation/genetics/physiology', 'Complement C3-C5 Convertases/*metabolism', 'Complement C5a/genetics/physiology', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC6314568,,2019/01/03 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0209024 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-22000 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 2;14(1):e0209024. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0209024. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,20190102,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exciting recent discoveries indicate the close involvement of m6A in regulating many different aspects of mRNA metabolism and diseases like cancer. However, our current knowledge about how m6A levels are controlled and whether and how regulation of m6A levels of a specific gene can play a role in cancer and other diseases is mostly elusive. We propose in this paper a computational scheme for predicting m6A-regulated genes and m6A-associated disease, which includes Deep-m6A, the first model for detecting condition-specific m6A sites from MeRIP-Seq data with a single base resolution using deep learning and Hot-m6A, a new network-based pipeline that prioritizes functional significant m6A genes and its associated diseases using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and gene-disease heterogeneous networks. We applied Deep-m6A and this pipeline to 75 MeRIP-seq human samples, which produced a compact set of 709 functionally significant m6A-regulated genes and nine functionally enriched subnetworks. The functional enrichment analysis of these genes and networks reveal that m6A targets key genes of many critical biological processes including transcription, cell organization and transport, and cell proliferation and cancer-related pathways such as Wnt pathway. The m6A-associated disease analysis prioritized five significantly associated diseases including leukemia and renal cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate the power of our proposed computational scheme and provide new leads for understanding m6A regulatory functions and its roles in diseases.","['Zhang, Song-Yao', 'Zhang, Shao-Wu', 'Fan, Xiao-Nan', 'Meng, Jia', 'Chen, Yidong', 'Gao, Shou-Jiang', 'Huang, Yufei']","['Zhang SY', 'Zhang SW', 'Fan XN', 'Meng J', 'Chen Y', 'Gao SJ', 'Huang Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1305-7447', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3455-205X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6268-5357']","[""Key Laboratory of Information Fusion Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.', ""Key Laboratory of Information Fusion Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Information Fusion Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Biological Sciences, HRINU, SUERI, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA197153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025465/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/genetics', 'Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Deep Learning', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps/genetics', '*Software']",PMC6331136,,2019/01/03 06:00,2019/03/05 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2018/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006663 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-18-00909 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2019 Jan 2;15(1):e1006663. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006663. eCollection 2019 Jan.,,,,,,,,20190102,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding of RUNX family members to specific DNA sequences is hypothesized to promote the expression of downstream genes and cause cancer proliferation. On the basis of this proposed mechanism of cancer growth, we developed conjugate 1, which inhibits the binding of RUNX to its target DNA. Conjugate 1 is a DNA-alkylating pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide conjugate containing chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. Conjugate 1 was reported to have a marked anticancer effect in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia. Although the effectiveness of 1 has been demonstrated in vivo, the detailed mechanism by which it alkylates DNA is unknown. Here, we chemically elucidated the molecular characteristics of conjugate 1 to confirm its potential as a RUNX-inhibiting drug. We also generated an alternative conjugate 2, which targets the same DNA sequence, by replacing one pyrrole with beta-alanine. Comparison of the characteristics of conjugates 1 and 2 suggested that reaction selectivity and binding affinity to the RUNX-binding sequence were improved by the introduction of beta-alanine. These findings indicate the possibility of DNA-alkylating PI polyamides as candidates for cancer chemotherapeutics.","['Maeda, Rina', 'Sato, Shinsuke', 'Obata, Shunsuke', 'Ohno, Tomo', 'Hashiya, Kaori', 'Bando, Toshikazu', 'Sugiyama, Hiroshi']","['Maeda R', 'Sato S', 'Obata S', 'Ohno T', 'Hashiya K', 'Bando T', 'Sugiyama H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8923-5946'],"['Graduate School of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8306 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502 , Japan.', 'Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Science (WPI-iCeMS) , Kyoto University , Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8501 , Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nylons)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Alkylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Nylons/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2019/01/03 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jacs.8b08813 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2019 Mar 13;141(10):4257-4263. doi: 10.1021/jacs.8b08813.

Hypothetically, judicious dose reductions could result in improved tolerance. Our objective was to study the impact of dose reductions on outcomes in CLL patients treated with ibrutinib in a real-world setting. We identified 70 CLL patients treated with ibrutinib at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 2014 and June 2017. Twenty-three (31.3%) patients required dose reductions. There was no statistically significant difference in overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), median progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) between the dose-reduced and standard-dose groups (SDGs). These results extended to all patients, irrespective of whether the modification was made within three months of treatment initiation, or later.","['Akhtar, Othman S', 'Attwood, Kristopher', 'Lund, Ian', 'Hare, Ryan', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco J', 'Torka, Pallawi']","['Akhtar OS', 'Attwood K', 'Lund I', 'Hare R', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri FJ', 'Torka P']",,"['a Department of Medicine , State University of New York at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'c Department of Medicine, Division of Lymphoma/Myeloma , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'd Roswell Park Pharmacy , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , State University of New York at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'c Department of Medicine, Division of Lymphoma/Myeloma , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , State University of New York at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'c Department of Medicine, Division of Lymphoma/Myeloma , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2019/01/03 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1554862 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jul;60(7):1650-1655. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1554862.

However, patient response remains unpredictable and drug resistance limits effectiveness of these drugs. Cancer cells exit from drug-induced mitotic arrest (mitotic slippage) to avoid subsequent cell death which is thought to be a major mechanism contributing to this resistance. The tumor cells that acquire resistance to anti-mitotic drugs have chromosomal instability (CIN) and are often aneuploid. In this review, we outline the key mechanisms involved in dictating the cell fate during perturbed mitosis and how these processes impede the efficacy of anti-mitotic therapies. Further, we emphasize the recent work from our laboratory, which highlights the functional role of CEP55 in protecting aneuploid cells from death. We also discuss the rationale of targeting CEP55 in vivo, which could prove to be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for sensitizing cells to microtubule inhibitors and might offer significantly improved patient outcome.

The putative SSCs were cultured on buffalo Sertoli cell feeder layer in KO-DMEM +10% KOSR. The colony formation was observed between 7 and 10 days. The putative SSC colonies also expressed markers specific for undifferentiated type A spermatogonia and pluripotency markers.

We found that all aspirate smears had >/=10% atypical megakaryocytes, predominantly characterized by small forms with hypolobated and eccentric nuclei, and forms with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios. Core biopsies showed variable cellularity and variable numbers of megakaryocytes with similar features to those in the aspirates. Granulocytic and/or erythroid dysplasia (>/=10% cells per lineage) were present infrequently. Megakaryocytes with separate nuclear lobes were increased in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia. Comparison to an immune thrombocytopenic purpura cohort confirms increased megakaryocytes with hypolobated eccentric nuclei in FPDMM patients. As such, patients with FPDMM often have atypical megakaryocytes with small hypolobated and eccentric nuclei even in the absence of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities; these findings are related to the underlying RUNX1 germline mutation and not diagnostic of MDS. Isolated megakaryocytic dysplasia in patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia should raise the possibility of an underlying germline RUNX1 mutation.","['Chisholm, Karen M', 'Denton, Christopher', 'Keel, Sioban', 'Geddis, Amy E', 'Xu, Min', 'Appel, Burton E', 'Cantor, Alan B', 'Fleming, Mark D', 'Shimamura, Akiko']","['Chisholm KM', 'Denton C', 'Keel S', 'Geddis AE', 'Xu M', 'Appel BE', 'Cantor AB', 'Fleming MD', 'Shimamura A']",,"[""1 Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""3 Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""4 Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '5 Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""6 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '7 Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""1 Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""8 Joseph M.

Their capacity to alter the behavior of the cells is one of the most controversial issues. In this study, we investigated apoptotic effects of MVs derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) in combination with ATO on NB4 cell line. MVs were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. After 7 days, MTT assay, Annexin-V-fluorescein staining assay and RT-qPCR for BCL-2, KI67, BAX genes expression were performed. The results showed lower cell viability rate, higher apoptosis ratio, higher BAX gene, and lower KI67 and BCL-2 genes' expression in cells exposed to MVs in combination with ATO compared to cells treated with each agent alone and non-treated control. We showed that MVs in combination with ATO had more apoptotic effect on NB4 cell line than each agent alone. MVs in combination with ATO in APL treatment might play an effective therapeutic role with fewer adverse side effects compared to any other agents.","['Abbaszade Dibavar, Mahnoosh', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Atashi, Amir', 'Rassaei, Neda', 'Amiri, Shahin']","['Abbaszade Dibavar M', 'Soleimani M', 'Atashi A', 'Rassaei N', 'Amiri S']",,"['a Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences , Tarbiat Modares University , Tehran , Iran.', 'b Department of Hemetology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Hematology and cell therapy , Tarbiat Modares University , Tehran , Iran.', 'c Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences , Shahroud , Iran.', 'd Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences , Tarbiat Modares University , Tehran , Iran.', 'e Department of Medical Biotechnology , Cellular and Molecular Research Centre, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences , Qazvin , Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",101594777,['S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', '*Cell-Derived Microparticles', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2019/01/03 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21691401.2018.1489821 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol. 2018;46(sup3):S138-S146. doi: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1489821.

Early identification of patients suspected to have ESBL-PE infection for empirical carbapenem administration is crucial; nevertheless, risk factors for ESBL-PE causing septic shock remain unclear. We identify factors to predict ESBL-PE in septic shock patients with chemotherapy-induced FN. In this observational, prospectively collected registry-based study, consecutive adult chemotherapy-induced FN patients with septic shock who were admitted to the emergency department between June 2012 and June 2018 were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory data extracted from the septic shock registry were assessed to identify risk factors for ESBL-PE. Of 179 chemotherapy-induced FN septic shock patients, ESBL-PE is isolated in 23 (12.8%). ESBL-PE infection is frequently seen in patients with hepatobiliary cancer (17.4% vs. 4.5%, P = 0.037), leukemia (13.0% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.046), and those with profound neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count < 100) (73.9% vs. 43.6%, P = 0.007) in contrast to those with lung cancer (0% vs. 14.7%, P = 0.048) and other solid cancer (0% vs. 19.2%, P = 0.016). Multivariate logistic regression reveals that profound neutropenia (adjusted OR 3.67; 95% CI 1.372-9.799; P = 0.010) is an independent risk factor for ESBL-PE infection after adjusting age, the presence of solid tumor, and the parameters of sepsis severity scores. ESBL-PE is rare (12.9%) in chemotherapy-induced FN patients with septic shock. Early empirical carbapenem therapy might be considered in chemotherapy-induced FN patients with profound neutropenia.","['Kim, Youn-Jung', 'Jung, Sung Min', 'Kang, Jihoon', 'Ryoo, Seung Mok', 'Sohn, Chang Hwan', 'Seo, Dong-Woo', 'Lim, Kyoung Soo', 'Huh, Jin Won', 'Kim, Sung-Han', 'Kim, Won Young']","['Kim YJ', 'Jung SM', 'Kang J', 'Ryoo SM', 'Sohn CH', 'Seo DW', 'Lim KS', 'Huh JW', 'Kim SH', 'Kim WY']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8642-6552'],"['Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive #0728, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88, Olimpic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, South Korea. wonpia73@naver.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",Italy,Intern Emerg Med,Internal and emergency medicine,101263418,,IM,"['APACHE', 'Aged', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*complications/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Organ Dysfunction Scores', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Republic of Korea', 'Risk Factors', 'Shock, Septic/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,,2019/01/03 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11739-018-02015-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11739-018-02015-x [pii]']",ppublish,Intern Emerg Med. 2019 Apr;14(3):433-440. doi: 10.1007/s11739-018-02015-x.

The protein is frequently overexpressed in human leukemias, breast cancers, and other solid tumors suggesting that it is a bona fide oncogene. c-MYB is often overexpressed by translocation in human tumors with t(6;7)(q23;q34) resulting in c-MYB-TCRbeta in T cell ALL, t(X;6)(p11;q23) with c-MYB-GATA1 in acute basophilic leukemia, and t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) with c-MYB-NF1B in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Antisense oligonucleotides to c-MYB were developed to purge bone marrow cells to eliminate tumor cells in leukemias. Recently, small molecules that inhibit c-MYB activity have been developed to disrupt its interaction with p300. The Dmp1 (cyclin D binding myb-like protein 1; Dmtf1) gene was isolated through its virtue for binding to cyclin D2. It is a transcription factor that has a Myb-like repeat for DNA binding. The Dmtf1 protein directly binds to the Arf promoter for transactivation and physically interacts with p53 to activate the p53 pathway. The gene is hemizygously deleted in 35-42% of human cancers and is associated with longer survival. The significances of aberrant expression of c-MYB and DMTF1 proteins in human cancers and their clinical significances are discussed.","['Fry, Elizabeth A', 'Inoue, Kazushi']","['Fry EA', 'Inoue K']",,"['a The Department of Pathology , Wake Forest University School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , NC , USA.', 'a The Department of Pathology , Wake Forest University School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , NC , USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA106314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (DMTF1 protein, human)', '0 (MYB protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hemizygote', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6431554,['NIHMS1002375'],2019/01/03 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2019/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07357907.2018.1550090 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2019;37(1):46-65. doi: 10.1080/07357907.2018.1550090.

However, reports of hypoglycemia associated with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are rare. Herein, we report an 8-year-old boy with severe symptomatic hypoglycemia likely due to 6-MP during chemotherapy. He had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 3 years previously and was in the maintenance chemotherapy period. Treatment included oral dexamethasone, methotrexate, and 6-MP, of which only 6-MP was administered daily. Hypoglycemic symptoms appeared mainly at dawn, and his serum glucose dropped to a minimum of 37 mg/dL. Laboratory findings showed nothing specific other than increased serum cortisol, free fatty acids, ketone, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Under the hypothesis of hypoglycemia due to chemotherapy drugs, we changed the time of 6-MP from evening to morning and recommended him to ingest carbohydrate-rich foods before bedtime. Hypoglycemia improved dramatically, and there was no further episode during the remaining maintenance chemotherapy period.

On the basis of a careful review of fresh medicinal plant usage to treat cancer from previous ethnobotanical interviews in Singapore and from the traditional uses of the indigenous plants, fresh leaves of seven locally grown medicinal plant species were evaluated for anti-proliferative activity. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of local medicinal plant species Clausena lansium Skeels, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau, Leea indica (Burm. f.) Merr., Pereskia bleo (Kunth) DC., Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume, Vernonia amygdalina Delile and Vitex trifolia L. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Fresh, healthy and mature leaves of the seven medicinal plants were harvested from various locations in Singapore and Malaysia for Soxhlet, ultrasonication and maceration extractions in three different solvents (water, ethanol and methanol). Cell proliferation assay using water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay was performed on twelve human cancer cell lines derived from breast (MDA-MB-231, T47D), cervical (C33A), colon (HCT116), leukemia (U937), liver (HepG2, SNU-182, SNU-449), ovarian (OVCAR-5, PA-1, SK-OV-3) and uterine (MES-SA/DX5) cancer. RESULTS: A total of 37 fresh leaf extracts from seven medicinal plants were evaluated for their anti-tumour activities in twelve human cancer cell lines. Of these, the extracts of C. lansium, L. indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity against multiple cancer cell lines. Further investigation of selected promising leaf extracts indicated that maceration methanolic extract of L. indica was most effective overall against majority of the cancer cell lines, with best IC50 values of 31.5+/-11.4microg/mL, 37.5+/-0.7microg/mL and 43.0+/-6.2microg/mL in cervical C33A, liver SNU-449, and ovarian PA-1 cancer cell lines, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide new scientific evidence for the traditional use of local medicinal plant species C. lansium, L . indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia in cancer treatment. These results highlight the importance of the upkeep of these indigenous plants in modern society and their relevance as resources for drug discovery.","['Siew, Yin-Yin', 'Yew, Hui-Chuing', 'Neo, Soek-Ying', 'Seow, See-Voon', 'Lew, Si-Min', 'Lim, Shun-Wei', 'Lim, Claire Sophie En-Shen', 'Ng, Yi-Cheng', 'Seetoh, Wei-Guang', 'Ali, Azhar', 'Tan, Chay-Hoon', 'Koh, Hwee-Ling']","['Siew YY', 'Yew HC', 'Neo SY', 'Seow SV', 'Lew SM', 'Lim SW', 'Lim CSE', 'Ng YC', 'Seetoh WG', 'Ali A', 'Tan CH', 'Koh HL']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, 18 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.

At a median follow-up of 6.3 months (range, 1.3 to 41.1 months), 7 patients (27%) had a response to AZA, defined as complete remission, hematologic improvement, or improved donor chimerism. Response occurred after a median of 3 cycles, and the median duration of response was 70 days (range, 26 to 464 days). Median survival was 6.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.8 to 11.1 months).

Leukemia can be classified into four types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). More than forty drugs are applicable to different types of leukemia based on the discrepant pathogenesis. Therefore, the identification of specific drug-targeted biological processes and pathways is helpful to determinate the underlying pathogenesis among such four types of leukemia. METHODS: In this study, the gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were highly related to drugs for leukemia were investigated for the first time. The enrichment scores for associated GO terms and KEGG pathways were calculated to evaluate the drugs and leukemia. The feature selection method, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), was used to analyze and identify important GO terms and KEGG pathways. RESULTS: Twenty Go terms and two KEGG pathways with high scores have all been confirmed to effectively distinguish four types of leukemia. CONCLUSION: This analysis may provide a useful tool for the discrepant pathogenesis and drug design of different types of leukemia.","['Lu, Jing', 'Zhang, YuHang', 'Wang, ShaoPeng', 'Bi, Yi', 'Huang, Tao', 'Luo, Xiaomin', 'Cai, Yu-Dong']","['Lu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang S', 'Bi Y', 'Huang T', 'Luo X', 'Cai YD']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation (Yantai University), Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University, 32 Qingquan Road, Yantai 264005, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai 200444, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation (Yantai University), Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University, 32 Qingquan Road, Yantai 264005, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai 200444, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,,IM,"['*Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,,2019/01/02 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2019/01/02 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCHTS-EPUB-95504 [pii]', '10.2174/1386207322666181231151900 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2020;23(4):295-303. doi: 10.2174/1386207322666181231151900.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GO term', '*KEGG pathway', '*Leukemia', '*enrichment score', '*mRMR', '*protein-drug interactions.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, while mESCs deprived of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 24 hours revert to their naive pluripotent state after subsequent LIF readdition, cells deprived of LIF for 48 hours are no longer efficient in reverting, upon LIF addition, and undergo irreversible differentiation. We investigated undisclosed bioenergetic profiles of early mESC-derived committed cells versus their undifferentiated states in order to reveal specific bioenergetic changes associated with mESC plasticity. Multiparametric bioenergetic analysis revealed that pluripotent (+LIF) and reversibly committed cells (-LIF24h) are energetically flexible, depending on both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. They exhibit high mitochondrial respiration in the presence of the main energetic substrates and can also rely on glycolysis in the presence of OXPHOS inhibitor. Inhibition of the glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration does not change drastically the expression of pluripotency genes, which remain well expressed. In addition, cells treated with these inhibitors keep their capacity to differentiate efficiently upon embryoid bodies formation. Transition from metabolically active mESCs to irreversibly committed cells is associated with a clear change in mitochondrial network morphology, to an increase of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced from glycolysis and a decline of ATP turnover and of the mitochondrial activity without change in the mitochondrial mass. Our study pointed that plasticity window of mESCs is associated with the bivalent energetic metabolism and potency to shift to glycolysis or OXPHOS on demand. LIF removal provokes glycolytic metabolic orientation and consecutive loss of the LIF-dependent reversion of cells to the pluripotent state.

Methods: This descriptive study enrolled 90 older patients undergoing treatment for hematological malignancies at an oncology hospital. Frailty was assessed with the Edmonton Frailty Scale as not frail (0-4), apparently vulnerable (5-6), mildly frail (7-8), moderately frail (9-10), and severely frail (11-17). The association of frailty and older patient characteristics and diagnosis was assessed by logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of frailty (mild, moderately, and severely) was 42.2%, and ""apparently vulnerable"" frailty was 60%. The mean scale score was 5.59 +/- 3.13. Frailty was more prevalent in patients who were >/=75 years of age, had >/=4 children, were diagnosed with leukemia, and were diagnosed for >/=2 years. Gender, diagnosis, and employment were factors associated with the presence of frailty. Female gender and lack of employment were factors associated with a high risk of frailty. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was associated with a low risk of frailty. Conclusions: The prevalence of frailty was high in older patients. Female and unemployed patients were at high risk for frailty. Frailty characteristics of older patients with hematologic cancer highlighted the need for comprehensive geriatric assessment and frailty screening, provided prevalence and characteristics of frailty in this group of patients during treatment, and highlighted the need for holistic care approach.","['Atakul, Esra', 'Akyar, Imatullah']","['Atakul E', 'Akyar I']",,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology Education and Training Hospital, Health Sciences University, Demetevler, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Medical Nursing Department, Faculty of Nursing, Hacettepe University, Samanpazari, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs,Asia-Pacific journal of oncology nursing,101673157,,,,PMC6287383,,2019/01/02 06:00,2019/01/02 06:01,['2019/01/02 06:00'],"['2019/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/apjon.apjon_35_18 [doi]', 'APJON-6-43 [pii]']",ppublish,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs. 2019 Jan-Mar;6(1):43-49. doi: 10.4103/apjon.apjon_35_18.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Frailty', 'geriatric oncology', 'hematology', 'older patients', 'oncology']",,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calbistrin A is a secondary metabolite with an interesting structure that was recently found to have bioactivity against leukemia cells. It consists of two polyketides linked by an ester bond: a bicyclic decalin containing polyketide with structural similarities to lovastatin, and a linear 12 carbon dioic acid structure. Calbistrin A is known to be produced by several uniseriate black Aspergilli, Aspergillus versicolor-related species, and Penicillia. Penicillium decumbens produces calbistrin A and B as well as several putative intermediates of the calbistrin pathway, such as decumbenone A-B and versiol. Results: A comparative genomics study focused on the polyketide synthase (PKS) sets found in three full genome sequence calbistrin producing fungal species, P. decumbens, A. aculeatus and A. versicolor, resulted in the identification of a novel, putative 13-membered calbistrin producing gene cluster (calA to calM). Implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in P. decumbens allowed the targeted deletion of genes encoding a polyketide synthase (calA), a major facilitator pump (calB) and a binuclear zinc cluster transcription factor (calC). Detailed metabolic profiling, using UHPLC-MS, of the calA (PKS) and calC (TF) strains confirmed the suspected involvement in calbistrin productions as neither strains produced calbistrin nor any of the putative intermediates in the pathway. Similarly analysis of the excreted metabolites in the calB (MFC-pump) strain showed that the encoded pump was required for efficient export of calbistrin A and B. Conclusion: Here we report the discovery of a gene cluster (calA-M) involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide calbistrin in P. decumbens. Targeted gene deletions proved the involvement of CalA (polyketide synthase) in the biosynthesis of calbistrin, CalB (major facilitator pump) for the export of calbistrin A and B and CalC for the transcriptional regulation of the cal-cluster. This study lays the foundation for further characterization of the calbistrin biosynthetic pathway in multiple species and the development of an efficient calbistrin producing cell factory.","['Grijseels, Sietske', 'Pohl, Carsten', 'Nielsen, Jens Christian', 'Wasil, Zahida', 'Nygard, Yvonne', 'Nielsen, Jens', 'Frisvad, Jens C', 'Nielsen, Kristian Fog', 'Workman, Mhairi', 'Larsen, Thomas Ostenfeld', 'Driessen, Arnold J M', 'Frandsen, Rasmus John Normand']","['Grijseels S', 'Pohl C', 'Nielsen JC', 'Wasil Z', 'Nygard Y', 'Nielsen J', 'Frisvad JC', 'Nielsen KF', 'Workman M', 'Larsen TO', 'Driessen AJM', 'Frandsen RJN']",,"['1Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Kgs.

The current first-line therapy for CML is administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib mesylate, dasatinib or nilotinib. Although effective to treat CML, some patients have become resistant to this therapy, leading to disease progression and death. Thus, the discovery of new compounds to improve CML therapy is still challenging. Here we addressed whether MjTX-I, a phospholipase A2 isolated from Bothrops moojeni snake venom, affects the viability of imatinib mesylate-resistant Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines. Methods: We examined the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effect of MjTX-I in K562-S and K562-R Bcr-Abl(+) cells and in the non-tumor HEK-293 cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and the hypotonic fluorescent solution methods, associated with detection of caspases 3, 8, and 9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. We also analyzed the MjTX-I potential to modulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes in K562-S and K562-R cells. Results: MjTX-I decreased the viability of K562-S and K562-R cells by 60 to 65%, without affecting the viability of the non-tumor cells, i.e. it exerted selective cytotoxicity towards Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines. In leukemic cell lines, the toxin induced apoptosis, activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, cleaved PARP, downregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2, and upregulated expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAD. Conclusion: The antitumor effect of MjTX-I is associated with its potential to induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines sensitive and resistant to imatinib mesylate, indicating that MjTX-I is a promising candidate drug to upgrade the CML therapy.","['Benati, Rogerio Bodini', 'Costa, Tassia Rafaela', 'Cacemiro, Maira da Costa', 'Sampaio, Suely Vilela', 'de Castro, Fabiola Attie', 'Burin, Sandra Mara']","['Benati RB', 'Costa TR', 'Cacemiro MDC', 'Sampaio SV', 'de Castro FA', 'Burin SM']",,"['Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas.

The survival of older patients is generally poor. In the current study, we sought to investigate the differences in molecular gene mutations between younger and older AML patients, and to identify those newly diagnosed AML patients who are more likely to respond to standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 179 patients who were newly diagnosed with non-M3 AML. A next-generation sequencing assay covering 34 genes was used to investigate recurrently mutated genes. The mutational status of fusion genes was determined by real time PCR. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 53 years (range 18-88 years). Sixty-eight patients were 60 years or older with a median age of 67 years (range 60-88 years). Eighteen patients (10.1%) carried t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion, and there was a significantly higher incidence in younger patients (p = 0.019). At least one non-synonymous gene mutation was detected in 159 patients (88.8%). The median number of gene mutations was two (range 0-6). The mean number of molecular gene mutations at diagnosis was higher in older patients than younger patients (2.5 vs 1.83, p = 0.003). Older patients had significantly higher incidences of ASXL1 (22.1% vs 13.5%, p = 0.025) and TP53 mutations (13.2% vs 3.6%, p = 0.034). In total, 78 patients received DA60 (daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) twice per day on days 1-7) as the induction therapy, and information was available on their response to induction treatment. Patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion were significantly more likely to achieve complete remission (CR) after DA60 induction therapy (p = 0.026), as were patients without the ASXL1 mutation (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Older AML patients had a lower incidence of favorable cytogenetics and higher frequencies and burdens of molecular mutations that are associated with poor prognosis compared to younger patients. Patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion or without the ASXL1 gene mutation had a better chance of achieving CR when treated with cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy.","['Cao, Xin-Xin', 'Cai, Hao', 'Mao, Yue-Ying', 'Wu, Qi', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Zhou, Dao-Bin', 'Li, Jian']","['Cao XX', 'Cai H', 'Mao YY', 'Wu Q', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou DB', 'Li J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33"", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 1 Shuai Fu Yuan Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100730 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 0662 3178grid.12527.33""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6303841,,2019/01/02 06:00,2019/01/02 06:01,['2019/01/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-018-0716-7 [doi]', '716 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2018 Dec 22;18:215. doi: 10.1186/s12935-018-0716-7. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'Older patients']",,,20181222,['Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Jan 14;19:14.

Optimal use of anti leukemic drugs has led to less toxicity and adverse reactions, and a higher survival rate. Thiopurine drugs, including 6-mercaptopurine, are mostly used as antileukemic medications in the maintenance phase of treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For those patients, TPMT genotype- tailored 6-mercaptopurine therapy is already implemented in the treatment protocols. We investigated the role of TPMT, ITPA, ABCC4 and ABCB1 genetic variants as predictors of outcome and 6-mercaptopurine induced toxicity during the maintenance phase of treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methods: Sixty-eight children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled in this study. Patients have been treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2002 or ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocols. Toxicity and adverse events have been monitored via surrogate markers (off-therapy weeks, episodes of leu - ko penia and average 6-mercaptopurine dose) and a prob- abilistic model was employed to predict overall 6-mercaptopurine related toxicity. Results: We confirmed that patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that carry inactive TPMT allele(s) require 6- mercaptopurine dose reduction. ITPA and ABCC4 genetic variants failed to show an association with 6-mercapto - purine induced toxicity during the maintenance phase. Carriers of ABCB1 variant allele experienced greater hepatotoxicity. The probabilistic model Neural net which considered all the analysed genetic variants was assessed to be the best prediction model. It was able to discriminate ALL patients with good and poor 6-mercaptopurin tolerance in 71% of cases (AUC=0.71). Conclusions: This study contributes to the design of a panel of pharmacogenetic markers for predicting thiopurineinduced toxicity in pediatric ALL.","['Milosevic, Goran', 'Kotur, Nikola', 'Krstovski, Nada', 'Lazic, Jelena', 'Zukic, Branka', 'Stankovic, Biljana', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Katsila, Theodora', 'Patrinos, George P', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Dokmanovic, Lidija']","['Milosevic G', 'Kotur N', 'Krstovski N', 'Lazic J', 'Zukic B', 'Stankovic B', 'Janic D', 'Katsila T', 'Patrinos GP', 'Pavlovic S', 'Dokmanovic L']",,"[""University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia."", 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', ""University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia."", 'University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia.', ""University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia."", 'University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', ""University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia."", 'University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'University of Patras School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Patras, Greece.', 'University of Patras School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Patras, Greece.', 'United Arab Emirates University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Pathology, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', ""University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia."", 'University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Serbia,J Med Biochem,Journal of medical biochemistry,101315490,,,,PMC6298470,,2019/01/02 06:00,2019/01/02 06:01,['2019/01/02 06:00'],"['2017/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/jomb-2017-0060 [doi]', 'jomb-2017-0060 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Biochem. 2018 Jul 1;37(3):320-327. doi: 10.1515/jomb-2017-0060. eCollection 2018 Jul.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)', 'ABCB1', 'ABCC4', 'ITPA', 'TPMT', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)']",,,20180701,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors stated that they have no conflicts of', 'interest regarding the publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells acquire resistance to dexamethasone (DEX)-mediated killing through abnormal activation of Akt, resulting in inhibition of the FoxO3a/Bim pathway. The resistant state was reported to be associated with increased glycolysis, NOTCH1 activating mutations and activated PI3K/ serum GS regulated kinases (SGK) pathway. Use of aforementioned pathway inhibitors blocked FoxO3a-phosphorylation and partially improved DEX-mediated killing of GC-resistant T-ALL cells, further revealing the essential role of the FoxO3a/Bim pathway in the development of GC resistance. Inhibition of Akt is most effective at restoring sensitivity to DEX of GC-resistant lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, but shows significant hepatotoxicity in vivo. A significantly elevated expression of Akt2 not Akt1 in intrinsically, secondarily GC-resistant lymphocytes and relapsed/refractory ALL patients implicates a more specific target for GC resistance. Mechanistically, Akt2 has a stronger binding capacity with FoxO3a compared to Akt1, and acts as a direct and major negative regulator of FoxO3a activity driving GC resistance. Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt2 more effectively restores sensitivity to GCs than inhibition of Akt1 in vitro, shows higher synergistic effect acting with DEX, and reverses GC resistance in GC-resistant T- or B- lymphoid tumors in vivo with reduced liver toxicity. In summary, these results suggest that Akt2 might serve as a more direct and specific kinase mediating GC resistance through FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway, and Akt2 inhibition may be explored as a promising target for treating GC-resistant hematopoietic malignancies.","['Xie, Mixue', 'Yang, Apeng', 'Ma, Jiexian', 'Wu, Min', 'Xu, Hongyue', 'Wu, Kefei', 'Jin, Youxin', 'Xie, Yanhui']","['Xie M', 'Yang A', 'Ma J', 'Wu M', 'Xu H', 'Wu K', 'Jin Y', 'Xie Y']",,"['Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350005, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Clinical Geriatric Medicine, Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Clinical Geriatric Medicine, Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, The Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Liaocheng, 252600, China."", 'Department of Hematology & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Clinical Geriatric Medicine, Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', 'The School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, China. xyh@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Clinical Geriatric Medicine, Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China. yxjin@sibs.ac.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6312545,,2019/01/02 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/01/02 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-1043-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-1043-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Jan 1;9(10):1013. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-1043-6.,,,,,,,,20190101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an obstacle in the treatment of cancer. It is therefore essential to understand the mechanisms underlying tumor resistance, especially those involved in the cell target/MDR relationship. To investigate this, the effects of exposing cells to UVB (to target DNA), UVA, and H2 O2 (to target the cell membrane) were observed in K562 (non MDR) and FEPS (MDR) cell lines. The K562 cells were more sensitive to UVA than the FEPS cells. The FEPS cell line was more resistant to H2 O2 than K562, only presenting cytotoxicity 72 h after being exposed to 40 mM, with no ROS increase until 48 h. Both cell lines were sensitive to UVB, presenting cytotoxicity after 24 h, mainly by apoptosis, and showed an increase in ROS levels.

The main disadvantages of crisantaspase are the short half-life (10 H) and immunogenicity. In this sense, its PEGylated form (PEG-crisantaspase) could not only reduce immunogenicity but also improve plasma half-life. In this work, we developed a process to obtain a site-specific N-terminal PEGylated crisantaspase (PEG-crisantaspase). Crisantaspase was recombinantly expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain cultivated in a shaker and in a 2-L bioreactor. Volumetric productivity in bioreactor increased 37% compared to shaker conditions (460 and 335 U L(-1) H(-1) , respectively). Crisantaspase was extracted by osmotic shock and purified by cation exchange chromatography, presenting specific activity of 694 U mg(-1) , 21.7 purification fold, and yield of 69%. Purified crisantaspase was PEGylated with 10 kDa methoxy polyethylene glycol-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (mPEG-NHS) at different pH values (6.5-9.0). The highest N-terminal pegylation yield (50%) was at pH 7.5 with the lowest poly-PEGylation ratio (7%). PEG-crisantaspase was purified by size exclusion chromatography and presented a KM value three times higher than crisantaspase (150 and 48.5 microM, respectively). Nonetheless, PEG-crisantaspase was found to be more stable at high temperatures and over longer periods of time. In 2 weeks, crisantaspase lost 93% of its specific activity, whereas PEG-crisantaspase was stable for 20 days. Therefore, the novel PEG-crisantaspase enzyme represents a promising biobetter alternative for the treatment of ALL.","['Torres-Obreque, Karin', 'Meneguetti, Giovanna Pastore', 'Custodio, Debora', 'Monteiro, Gisele', 'Pessoa-Junior, Adalberto', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui, Carlota']","['Torres-Obreque K', 'Meneguetti GP', 'Custodio D', 'Monteiro G', 'Pessoa-Junior A', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui C']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4221-9505'],"['Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['001/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior', 'Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico', '2013/08617-7/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo', '2016/22065-5/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo']",['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*biosynthesis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*therapy']",,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bab.1723 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2019 May;66(3):281-289. doi: 10.1002/bab.1723.

There are limited data regarding risk factors and outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for t-AML following a prior solid tumor, and furthermore, the impact of myeloablative (MAC) vs reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) on survival is unknown. The acute leukemia working party (ALWP) of the European society for blood and bone marrow transplantation (EBMT) performed a large registry study that included 535 patients with t-AML and prior solid tumor who underwent first MAC or RIC allogeneic HCT from 2000-2016. The primary endpoints of the study were OS and LFS. Patients receiving RIC regimens had an increase in relapse incidence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.26; P = 0.04), lower LFS (HR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.12-2.05, P = 0.007), and OS (HR, 1.51; CI 1.09-2.09; P = 0.012). There were no differences in NRM and GRFS. Importantly, LFS and OS were superior in patients receiving ablative regimens due to a decrease in relapse. As NRM continues to decline in the current era, it is conceivable that outcomes of HCT for t-AML with prior solid tumor may be improved by careful patient selection for myeloablative regimens.","['Lee, Catherine J', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Itala-Remes, Maija', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Mailhol, Audrey', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Lee CJ', 'Labopin M', 'Beelen D', 'Finke J', 'Blaise D', 'Ganser A', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Chevallier P', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Maertens J', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Bourhis JH', 'Mailhol A', 'Mohty M', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2587-8955'],"['Utah Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Oncology, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', ""Department D'Hematologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'CHU de Lille, Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/microbiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/mortality/therapy', 'Societies, Medical', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25395 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Apr;94(4):431-438. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25395.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Ex vivo pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ by Verteporfin enabled us to efficiently eradicate experimentally induced small tumours, derived from leukaemia and rhabdomyosarcoma, from human ovarian tissue fragments. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Autotransplantation of ovarian tissue fragments that contain metastasized tumour cells may reintroduce the malignancy to the recipient. In order to enhance safety for the patient there is a strong need for protocols that effectively purges the ovarian tissue from malignant cells ex vivo prior to transplantation, without compromising ovarian tissue integrity. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Tumour foci were experimentally induced in human ovarian cortex tissue fragments derived from at least three patients by micro-injection of cancer cell lines. Next, the tissue fragments were cultured to allow formation of metastasis-like structures followed by a 24 h ex vivo treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor Verteporfin to eradicate the cancer cells. A control treatment was included in all experiments. The purged ovarian cortex fragments were cultured for an additional 6 days to allow any possibly surviving cancer cells to establish new metastatic foci. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human ovarian tissue was obtained after female-to-male sex reassignment surgery. Human rhabdomyosarcoma, leukeamia, breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma cell lines were utilized for the induction of tumour foci. Tumour specific (immuno)histochemistry and RT-PCR were used for the detection of residual cancer cells after ex vivo treatment. Ovarian tissue and follicle integrity after exposure to Verteporfin was evaluated by histology, a follicular viability assay and a glucose uptake assay. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Metastasized rhabdomyosarcoma and leukaemia cells could be effectively purged from ovarian cortex tissue by a 24 h ex vivo treatment with Verteporfin, while breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma did not respond to this treatment. Ovarian tissue integrity was not affected by purging, as no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed in the percentage of morphologically normal follicles, percentage of follicles with apoptotic cells, follicular viability or glucose uptake between the control treated ovarian cortex and Verteporfin treated ovarian cortex. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our tumour model is based on growth of human cancer cell lines. It is unclear whether these cells reflect the behaviour of malignant cells that have metastasized to the ovary during natural disease progression. Furthermore, the functionality of the ovarian tissue after ex vivo treatment requires further investigation in vivo. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results indicate that ex-vivo tumour cell purging of human ovarian cortex fragments intended for fertility preservation purposes is feasible by short-term pharmacological treatment. Effective purging of the ovarian cortex tissue enhances safety of ovarian cortex autotransplantation for the patient. This increases the likelihood that this form of fertility restoration may become an option for patients with malignancies for which ovarian cortex transplantation is currently considered unsafe.

We generated a Flt3 conditional knock-out (Flt3(fl/fl)) mouse model to address the direct role of FLT3 in regulation of lymphoid-restricted progenitors, subsequent to turning on Rag1 expression, as well as potentially ontogeny-specific roles in B and T lymphopoiesis. Our studies establish a prominent and direct role of FLT3, independently of the established role of FLT3 in regulation of LMPPs and CLPs, in regulation of fetal as well as adult early B cell progenitors, and the early thymic progenitors (ETPs) in adult mice but not in the fetus. Our findings highlight the potential benefit of targeting poor prognosis acute B-cell progenitor leukaemia and ETP leukaemia with recurrent FLT3 mutations using clinical FLT3 inhibitors.","['Zriwil, Alya', 'Boiers, Charlotta', 'Kristiansen, Trine A', 'Wittmann, Lilian', 'Yuan, Joan', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Sitnicka, Ewa', 'Jacobsen, Sten E W']","['Zriwil A', 'Boiers C', 'Kristiansen TA', 'Wittmann L', 'Yuan J', 'Nerlov C', 'Sitnicka E', 'Jacobsen SEW']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5332-7048'],"['Lund Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Haematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Haematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Haematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Haematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Lund Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Haematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Wallenberg Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Center for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['MC_UU_00016/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0701761/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0801073/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00016/7/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0501838/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/7/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/pathology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6492191,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.15578 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Nov;183(4):588-600. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15578.

The Bcl-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 (Venetoclax) shows promising antileukaemic activity against AML, though Mcl-1 limits its antileukaemic activity. XPO1 is a nuclear exporter overexpressed in AML cells and its inhibition decreases Mcl-1 levels in cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that the XPO1-selective inhibitor KPT-330 (Selinexor) can synergize with ABT-199 to induce apoptosis in AML cells through down-regulation of Mcl-1. The combination of KPT-330 and ABT-199 was found to synergistically induce apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples and cooperatively inhibit colony formation capacity of primary AML cells. KPT-330 treatment decreased Mcl-1 protein after apoptosis initiation. However, binding of Bim to Mcl-1 induced by ABT-199 was abrogated by KPT-330 at the same time as apoptosis initiation. KPT-330 treatment increased binding of Bcl-2 to Bim but was overcome by ABT-199 treatment, demonstrating that KPT-330 and ABT-199 reciprocally overcome apoptosis resistance. Mcl-1 knockdown and overexpression confirmed its critical role in the antileukaemic activity of the combination. In summary, KPT-330 treatment, alone and in combination with ABT-199, modulates Mcl-1, which plays an important role in the antileukaemic activity of the combination.","['Luedtke, Daniel A', 'Su, Yongwei', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Wang, Yue', 'Lin, Hai', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Luedtke DA', 'Su Y', 'Liu S', 'Edwards H', 'Wang Y', 'Lin H', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8748-716X'],"['Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '31TZ62FO8F (selinexor)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/administration & dosage', 'Karyopherins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage']",PMC6237582,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13886 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Dec;22(12):6099-6111. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13886.

Tp92 is the only T. pallidum outer membrane protein that has structural features similar to the outer membrane proteins of other Gram-negative bacteria, but the exact functions of this protein remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the recombinant Tp92 protein can induce human mononuclear cell death. Tp92 mediated the human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monicytic leukemia patient (THP-1) cell death by recognizing CD14 and/or TLR2 on cell surfaces. After the stimulation of THP-1 cells by the Tp92 protein, Tp92 may induce atypical pyroptosis of THP-1 cells via the pro-caspase-1 pathway. Meanwhile, this protein caused the apoptosis of THP-1 cells via the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/caspase-8/aspase-3 pathway. Tp92 reduced the number of monocytes among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, further research showed that Tp92 failed to increase the tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP)-1 levels but slightly elevated the IL-8 levels via the Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB pathway in THP-1 cells. The data suggest that Tp92 recognizes CD14 and TLR2, transfers the signal to a downstream pathway, and activates NF-kappaB to mediate the production of IL-8. This mechanism may help T. pallidum escape recognition and elimination by the host innate immune system.","['Luo, Xi', 'Zhang, Xiaohong', 'Gan, Lin', 'Zhou, Chenglong', 'Zhao, Tie', 'Zeng, Tiebing', 'Liu, Shuangquan', 'Xiao, Yongjian', 'Yu, Jian', 'Zhao, Feijun']","['Luo X', 'Zhang X', 'Gan L', 'Zhou C', 'Zhao T', 'Zeng T', 'Liu S', 'Xiao Y', 'Yu J', 'Zhao F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9542-6896'],"['Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology and Key Laboratory of Special Pathogen Prevention and Control of Hunan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center for New Molecular Drug Research, University of South China, Hengyang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tp92 antigen, Treponema pallidum)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*genetics', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Caspase 1/genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Syphilis/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*genetics', 'Treponema pallidum/genetics/pathogenicity']",PMC6237608,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13879 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Dec;22(12):6039-6054. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13879.

Among all immunotherapeutic methods, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) redirected T cells obtained the most spectacular results, in particular with pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Classical validation methods of CAR T cells rely on the use of specificity and functionality assays of the CAR T cells against target cells in suspension and in xenograft models. Unfortunately, observations made in vitro are often decoupled from results obtained in vivo and a lot of effort and animals could be spared by adding another step: the use of 3D culture. The production of spheroids out of potential target cells that mimic the 3D structure of the tumor cells when they are engrafted into the animal model represents an ideal alternative. Here, we report an affordable, reliable and easy method to produce spheroids from a transduced colorectal cell line as a validation tool for adoptive cell therapy (exemplified here by CD19 CAR T cells).

AREAS COVERED: ALL survivors are a heterogeneous group according to therapeutic protocols. In the last decades, cranial radiotherapy (cRT) has been largely replaced by intrathecal chemotherapy (CT) with a reduction of endocrine sequelae. Published studies are generally difficult to be interpreted because patients were treated according to different risk-adapted protocols and results are conflicting. We perform this review on endocrine long-term effects in childhood ALL survivors focusing on studies published in the last decades. Articles were selected using the following terms (Mesh terms): 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia' AND 'survivors' AND 'childhood' AND 'growth/puberty/fertility/obesity/metabolic syndrome/bone'. EXPERT COMMENTARY: Most childhood ALL survivors treated with CT alone attain normal height and have adequate pubertal development. Despite recent protocols improvements, ALL survivors still develop long-term metabolic complications (overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease) especially the female gender and patients with an increased body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis. The aim of this review is to describe the state of the art on these topics. We should be able to anticipate, prevent, and treat endocrine long-term morbidities through a well-established follow-up strategy.","['Bruzzi, Patrizia', 'Bigi, Elena', 'Predieri, Barbara', 'Bonvicini, Federico', 'Cenciarelli, Valentina', 'Felici, Francesca', 'Iughetti, Lorenzo']","['Bruzzi P', 'Bigi E', 'Predieri B', 'Bonvicini F', 'Cenciarelli V', 'Felici F', 'Iughetti L']",,"['a Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'b Oncology and Hematology Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'a Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'c Post Graduate School of Pediatrics, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'c Post Graduate School of Pediatrics, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'c Post Graduate School of Pediatrics, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'c Post Graduate School of Pediatrics, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab,Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,101278293,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/drug effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Child Development/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Obesity/chemically induced', 'Overweight/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sexual Maturation/*drug effects']",,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/10/31 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17446651.2019.1561271 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab. 2019 Jan;14(1):49-61. doi: 10.1080/17446651.2019.1561271.

ATL is clinically classified into four disease subtypes. The acute, lymphoma type, and cases of the chronic type involving unfavorable prognostic factors are regarded as aggressive ATL subtypes that require immediate treatment. Dose-intensified chemotherapy, such as the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen, is considered to be the most recommended treatment for aggressive ATL. However, ATL remains difficult to cure and has an extremely poor prognosis, even when such chemotherapy is employed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only known curative therapy and is recommended for younger patients with aggressive ATL. However, because of the increasing age at the onset of ATL, only a small fraction of patients with ATL can benefit from such transplants; therefore, there is an unmet medical need for novel drugs. Mogamulizumab, a defucosylated, humanized anti-C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, was developed using a novel glycoengineering technique. Mogamulizumab monotherapy achieved clinically meaningful effects in patients with relapsed aggressive ATL and has exhibited acceptable toxicity profiles both inside and outside of Japan. In addition, lenalidomide has shown promising antitumor activity in patients with ATL. Furthermore, based on the results of translational research, several promising novel agents are currently being investigated and might contribute to improving the prognosis of ATL.","['Munakata, Wataru', 'Tobinai, Kensei']","['Munakata W', 'Tobinai K']",,"['Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. wmunakat@ncc.go.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,,IM,"['Adult', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-99716-2_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2019;176:145-161. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-99716-2_7.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'CCR4', 'Lenalidomide', 'Mogamulizumab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After due institutional review board approval, patients with high risk ALL/LBL post HCT were identified and included. All records were retrospectively collected. Time to event analysis was calculated from the date of HCT until event of interest or last follow up with Kaplan-Meir means. Cox regression model was used for multivariable analysis calculation. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were enrolled and examined with a median age of 21 (14-61). After a median follow up of 15 mo (2-87.3), the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse, cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality, progression free survival and overall survival (OS) were 34.1%, 10.9%, 54.9% and 62.8%, respectively. In a multivariable analysis for OS; acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were significant with corresponding hazard ratio 4.9 (1.99-12; P = 0.0007) and 0.29 (0.1-0.67; P = 0.0044), respectively.

In addition, nonviral adjunct therapeutic options for the prevention of GvHD in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are discussed. The role of oncolytic viruses to treat different HSCT-eligible hematological cancers is also considered and correlated with the issue of GvHD in the context of allo-HSCT. Recent Findings: Emerging therapies focused on the prevention or treatment of GvHD include the use of regulatory T cells (Tregs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), microbiome manipulation, B cell inhibitors, among others. Our lab and others have reported that an oncolytic DNA virus from the Poxviridae family, called myxoma virus (MYXV), not only exhibits oncolytic activity against various hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma (MM) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but also, in addition, ex vivo MYXV treatment of human allogeneic-bone marrow transplants (allo-BMT), or allo-peripheral blood mononuclear cell (allo-PBMC) transplants can abrogate GvHD in xenografted mice without impairing graft-vs-tumor (GvT) effects against residual cancer. To date, this is the first and the only oncolytic virus with a dual potential of mediating oncolysis against a residual cancer target and also inhibiting or preventing GvHD following allo-HSCT. Summary: This review discusses how oncolytic virotherapy can be applied as a potential adjunct therapy for the potential treatment of GvHD. In addition, we highlight major emerging nonviral therapies currently studied for the treatment or prevention of GvHD. We also review the emerging oncolytic virotherapies against different hematological cancers currently eligible for allo-HSCT and highlight the potential role of the oncolytic virus MYXV to decrease GvHD while maintaining or enhancing the positive benefits of GvT.","['Villa, Nancy Y', 'McFadden, Grant']","['Villa NY', 'McFadden G']",,"['Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.0000 0001 2151 2636grid.215654.1', 'Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.0000 0001 2151 2636grid.215654.1']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Pathobiol Rep,Current pathobiology reports,101599032,,,,PMC6290699,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40139-018-0186-6 [doi]', '186 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Pathobiol Rep. 2018;6(4):247-263. doi: 10.1007/s40139-018-0186-6.

The current study investigates cytotoxic and apoptogenic effects of methanolic extract of Beryonia aspera, and also synergistic effects of this extract and Prednisolone on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Materials and Methods: The under study populations were NALM-6 and REH cell lines. Cells were treated by Prednisolone and B. aspera extract alone and in combination. The effect of the drugs on survival and apoptosis were examined using MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, the effects of the drugs on the mRNA expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were studied using RQ-PCR. Finally, both the transcriptional and enzymatic activity of caspase-3 were investigated by caspase-3 assay kit. Results: The B. aspera extract induced cell growth inhibition and triggered apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Real-time PCR analysis of apoptotic target genes revealed that this agent shifted the ratio of the death promoter to death repressor genes via alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels. These changes resulted in caspase-3 activation, which led to DNA fragmentation and subsequent apoptosis. Our study has also demonstrated that the combined treatment of B. aspera extract with Prednisolone did not induce greater cytotoxic effect as compared to treatment series using either Prednisolone alone. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the B. aspera extract has anti-leukemic properties on BCP-ALL cell lines and could be regarded as a promising agent for the treatment of ALL.","['Yazdanpanah, Sorur', 'Esmaeili, Somayeh', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Dehghan Nayeri, Nasrin', 'Esfini Farahani, Mohammad', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad']","['Yazdanpanah S', 'Esmaeili S', 'Bashash D', 'Dehghan Nayeri N', 'Esfini Farahani M', 'Gharehbaghian A']",,"['Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center (TMRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC6305267,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2018 Jul 1;12(3):204-212.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Bryonia aspera', 'Combination therapy', 'Prednisolone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the main reasons of treatment failure in patients after allo-HSCT is return of the primary disease. This study aimed to evaluate the role of different modalities available to treat the patients with relapsed acute leukemia after allo-HSCT, focusing mainly on donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs). Materials and Methods: This study included 277 patients who relapsed after myeloablative allo-HSCT between February 2003 and February 2015. Treatment option was offered to all patients, but it was not accepted by about one-third of the study participants. Treated patients were categorized based on receipt of DLI (DLI-based vs. non DLI-based). The effect of treatment in all patients and then the effect of DLI among the treated group was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier method was used for calculating survival rates. All patients were relapsed cases, thus only overall survival (OS) was calculated. Results: One hundred and forty-five ALL patients and 132 AML patients were included in the study. One year survival rate for treated patients was 25.13% and for patients who received best supportive care was 2.79% (P<0.001). The difference was significant in both AML and ALL groups. Using DLI-based treatments were accompanied by a noticeably superior outcome. Hazard ratio was 0.43 (0.29-0.63) for DLI-based treatments (P<0.001). Conclusion: Despite the poor prognosis of relapsed acute leukemia after HSCT, it seems that treatment interventions and, especially DLI-based treatments, can be of substantial benefit for patients.","['Vaezi, Mohammad', 'Zokaasadi, Mohammad', 'Shahsavari Pour, Shervin', 'Kasaeian, Amir', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Kamranzadeh Fumani, Hosein', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Vaezi M', 'Zokaasadi M', 'Shahsavari Pour S', 'Kasaeian A', 'Nikbakht M', 'Kamranzadeh Fumani H', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']",,"['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC6305269,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2018 Jul 1;12(3):185-191.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Donor leukocyte infusions', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Leukemia', 'Recurrence', 'Survival analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to epidemiologically and demographically assess common cancers in children in Iran. Materials and Methods: This cohort study was conducted on children registered in Mahak Hospital and Rehabilitation Complex (which is a non-governmental organizations (NGO)-related hospital for only malignant diseases). A total of 2232 questionnaires were filled out for cancer patients between 2007 and 2016. The factors including age, gender, race, family history, type of treatment, and type of cancer were entered into Cox regression model to examine their effect on mortality of children diagnosed with cancer. Results: The Cox regression model showed that age, race, type of cancer, family history of cancer, and type of treatment had a significant effect on mortality of children diagnosed with cancer (P < 0.05). The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality in 10-15 years old was higher than that of 1-5 years old (P = 0.03, HR = 1.3). The HR of mortality in patients with brain tumor (P < 0.01, HR = 2.24), sarcoma (P < 0.01, HR = 2.32), and neuroblastoma (P < 0.01, HR = 2.56) was twice the value in patients with leukemia. The HR of mortality in patients who had a family history of cancer was higher than that of patients without it (P < 0.01, HR = 1.33). Patients who had undergone chemotherapy along with surgery and radiotherapy (P = 0.02, HR = 0.68) and patients who received chemotherapy along with surgery (P = 0.01, HR = 0.67) had a lower HR of mortality compared to the chemotherapy group. Conclusion: Young age, multidisciplinary approach, and absence of family history were associated with lower hazard of death in children diagnosed with cancer; brain tumor, leukemia, and sarcoma had higher hazard of mortality compared to leukemia. Children with a family history of cancer should be under regular follow-up. Treatment should be multidisciplinary and comprehensive.","['Keramatinia, Aliasghar', 'Mohseny, Maryam', 'Akbari, Mohammad Esmaeil', 'Mosavi-Jarrahi, Alireza', 'Monfared, Esmat Davoudi', 'Amanpour, Farzaneh', 'Bahadori Monfared, Ayad', 'Amiri, Parastoo', 'Khayamzadeh, Maryam', 'Khoshbin Khoshnazar, Tahereh Alsadat', 'Abbaszadeh, Hojjat-Allah', 'Mehrvar, Azim', 'Mazloumi, Zeinab', 'Movafagh, Abolfazl']","['Keramatinia A', 'Mohseny M', 'Akbari ME', 'Mosavi-Jarrahi A', 'Monfared ED', 'Amanpour F', 'Bahadori Monfared A', 'Amiri P', 'Khayamzadeh M', 'Khoshbin Khoshnazar TA', 'Abbaszadeh HA', 'Mehrvar A', 'Mazloumi Z', 'Movafagh A']",,"['Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health and Community Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health and Community Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health and Community Medicine, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Health Management Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.', 'Department of Health and Community Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iranian Research Center on Healthy Aging, Sabzevar University of Medical Scienses, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hearing Disorders Research Center, Loghman Hakim Medical Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology and Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health and Community Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MAHAK Pediatric Cancer Treatment and Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Zanjan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,J Res Med Sci,Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,101235599,,,,PMC6282777,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2017/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jrms.JRMS_835_17 [doi]', 'JRMS-23-101 [pii]']",epublish,J Res Med Sci. 2018 Nov 28;23:101. doi: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_835_17. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cox models', 'childhood', 'epidemiology', 'survival']",,,20181128,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the cellular units responsible for relapse in AML, and strategies that target LSCs are thus critical. One proposed potential strategy to this end is to break the quiescent state of LSCs, thereby sensitizing LSCs to conventional cytostatics. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway is a main driver of cellular quiescence and a potential therapeutic target, with precedence from both solid cancers and leukemias. Here, we used a conditional knockout Hif-1alpha mouse model together with a standard chemotherapy regimen to evaluate LSC targeting in AML.

Immunotherapies, targeting tumor cells and/or the immune system to enhance existing anti-tumor immunity or induce novel anti-tumor immune responses, are becoming increasingly successful in adult oncology. Based on the results obtained with anti-ganglioside2 antibodies in neuroblastoma, rituximab in mature B malignancies, immune checkpoint inhibitors in lymphoma and especially in Hodgkin lymphoma, blinatumomab and CAR-T CD19 cells for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, immunotherapy has demonstrated irrefutable benefits in pediatric patients. However, these results are currently limited to a minority of patients and histologies. Current and ongoing trials tend to focus on a single type of immunotherapy, but it is likely that combinations of immunotherapies with different mechanisms of action or combination with other classes of anti-cancer treatments will be additives or even synergistic. The development of this new class of drugs in the treatment of pediatric cancers has multiple challenges: to better evaluate the response to treatment, to define the optimal doses and schedules, to manage immuno-mediated toxicities, to identify its specific sequelae, and, finally, to better understand the strategies of immune evasion of pediatric cancers in order to develop efficient immunotherapies.","['Pasqualini, Claudia', 'Rialland, Fanny', 'Valteau-Couanet, Dominique', 'Michon, Jean', 'Minard-Colin, Veronique']","['Pasqualini C', 'Rialland F', 'Valteau-Couanet D', 'Michon J', 'Minard-Colin V']",,"[""Departement de cancerologie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, Gustave-Roussy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: we describe the experience of initiating and building this program by retrospectively reviewing the data from pediatric patients with cancer diagnosed at the Lao-Korea National Children's Hospital between September 2012 and December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 44), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 12), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 7), lymphoma (n = 6), retinoblastoma (n = 5), Wilms tumor (n = 3), and germ cell tumor (n = 1) were included. Of the 44 patients with ALL, 40 received induction chemotherapy, and 4 refused chemotherapy. Of these 40 patients, 29 (73.6%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 9 (22.5%) died during chemotherapy. Of the 29 patients with CR, 4 completed the chemotherapy, 19 were still on chemotherapy, 4 relapsed, and 2 were deceased. Treatment was unsuccessful for all 12 patients with AML. CONCLUSION: We successfully initiated the pediatric cancer care program but faced challenges associated with high mortality because of insufficient resources. We should continue our efforts to find more abandoned patients, detect cancer earlier, and reduce the overall associated mortality.","['Park, Kyung Duk', 'Hong, Che Ry', 'Choi, Jung Yoon', 'Kim, Min Sun', 'Yi, Eun Sang', 'Saysouliyo, Sonephet', 'Phongsavath, Khounthavy', 'Shin, Hee Young']","['Park KD', 'Hong CR', 'Choi JY', 'Kim MS', 'Yi ES', 'Saysouliyo S', 'Phongsavath K', 'Shin HY']",,"['a Department of Pediatrics , Chonbuk National University College of Medicine , Jeonju , Republic of Korea.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'c Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', ""d Department of Pediatrics , National Children's Hospital , Vientiane , Lao Democratic People's Republic."", ""d Department of Pediatrics , National Children's Hospital , Vientiane , Lao Democratic People's Republic."", 'b Department of Pediatrics , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Laos', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2018.1477888 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 May;35(4):268-275. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2018.1477888.

However, the effects of chronic hyperglycemic conditions on hematopoiesis and the microenvironment in the bone marrow (BM) are not yet well understood. Methods: BM cells were harvested from femurs of mice and analyzed using flow cytometry. Human PVCs were cultured in serum-free alpha-MEM. After 24hrs, PVC-CM was collected and filtered through a 0.22 mum filter. Results: In this study, we showed that hyperglycemia alters hematopoietic composition in the BM, which can partially be restored via paracrine mechanisms, including perivascular cells (PVCs) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibition in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Prolonged hyperglycemic conditions resulted in an increase in the frequency and number of long-term hematopoietic stem cells as well as the number of total BM cells. The altered hematopoiesis in the BM was partially recovered by treatment with PVC-derived conditioned medium (CM). Long-term diabetes also increased the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the BM, which was partially restored by the administration of PVC-CM and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a NOX inhibitor. We further showed the downregulation of ERK and p38 phosphorylation in BM cells of diabetic mice treated with PVC-CM and DPI. This may be associated with dysfunction of hematopoietic cells and promotion of subsequent diabetic complications. Conclusions: Our data suggested that alterations in BM hematopoietic composition due to prolonged hyperglycemic conditions might be restored by improvement of the hematopoietic microenvironment and modulation of NOX activity.","['Kim, Ji-Young', 'Lee, Ji Yoon', 'Ha, Kwon-Soo', 'Han, Eun-Taek', 'Park, Won Sun', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Hong, Seok-Ho']","['Kim JY', 'Lee JY', 'Ha KS', 'Han ET', 'Park WS', 'Min CK', 'Hong SH']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell Institute, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Environmental Biology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,,,,PMC6457702,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijsc18097 [pii]', '10.15283/ijsc18097 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2018 Mar 30;12(1):63-72. doi: 10.15283/ijsc18097.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoiesis', 'Hyperglycemia', 'MDSCs', 'NOX', 'Perivascular niche']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their relevance in terms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect is largely unknown. The predictive role of early recovery in the immune cells on acute GVHD and GVL effect after allo-HSCT was investigated in patients with acute leukemia who achieved the first complete remission. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were taken at the median of 14 days (range, 12 approximately 29 days) after allo-HSCT. A cohort including 119 samples and characteristics of patients were analyzed. Immune cell populations were identified by flow cytometry. Results: The median age was 49.0 years (range, 21 approximately 69) at transplantation. Univariate analysis showed that age less than 40 years old, lower frequencies of CD8(+) T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and higher frequency of immature MDSCs were associated with occurrence of grade III-IV acute GVHD. Multivariate analyses showed that iNKT cells (hazard ratio (HR), 0.453, 95% CI, 0.091 approximately 0.844, p=0.024) and M-MDSCs (HR, 0.271, 95% CI, 0.078 approximately 0.937, p=0.039) were independent factors. Combination of higher frequencies of both cell subsets was associated with lower incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD, whereas patients with lower frequency of iNKT cells and higher frequency of M-MDSCs showed significant higher probability of relapse. Conclusions: iNKT cells and M-MDSCs could be relevant cell biomarkers for predicting acute GVHD and/or relapse in acute leukemia patients treated with allo-HSCT.","['Kim, Tae Woo', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Lim, Ji-Young', 'Min, Gi June', 'Park, Silvia', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Kim TW', 'Park SS', 'Lim JY', 'Min GJ', 'Park S', 'Jeon YW', 'Yahng SA', 'Shin SH', 'Lee SE', 'Yoon JH', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Incheon, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,,,,PMC6457701,,2019/01/01 06:00,2019/01/01 06:01,['2019/01/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:01 [medline]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijsc18094 [pii]', '10.15283/ijsc18094 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2018 Dec 31;12(1):73-83. doi: 10.15283/ijsc18094.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Graft-versus-leukemia effect', 'Invariant NKT cells', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diterpenoid from the plant, precalyone, exhibited antiproliferative activity against P-388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line. Cinereanoid D, a labdane diterpenoid that inhibits ATP binding of heat shock protein Hsp90, is a potential anticancer lead. Two compounds from aerial parts of the plant, 4-methoxybenzo[b]azet-2(1H)-one and 3beta-hydroxy-35-(cyclohexyl-5'-propan-7'-one)-33-ethyl-34-methylbacteriohop-16-e ne, showed antidiabetic activity. Thus, the scientific reports confirm the ethnomedicinal use of this plant in diabetes, malaria and liver diseases. CONCLUSION: Roylea cinerea is a traditionally used medicinal plant from Western Himalayas. The pharmacological evaluation confirmed the ethnomedically claimed antidiabetic activity using scientifically accepted protocols and controls, although some of the studies require reconfirmation. The bioactivity-guided fractionation attributes the activity to 4-methoxybenzo[b]azet-2(1H)-one and 3beta-hydroxy-35-(cyclohexyl-5'-propan-7'-one)-33-ethyl-34-methylbacteriohop-16-e ne. Further, cinereanoid D is a potential lead for targeting Hsp90 and its medicinal chemistry studies can lead to a potent anticancer compound. The plant extract also showed antimalarial and hepatoprotective activities. Some of the studies discussed in this review require reconfirmation, as the protocols lacked proper positive and negative controls. Thus, the review of the scientific reports on Roylea cinerea supports ethnomedicinal use as antidiabetic, antimalarial and hepatoprotective. Further studies to prove scientific basis for use in leucorrhea, skin diseases, inflammation and strengthening of claims for liver tonic are required.","['Pundir, Swati', 'Mahindroo, Neeraj']","['Pundir S', 'Mahindroo N']",,"['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University, PO Box 9, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173212, India.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University, PO Box 9, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173212, India.

The impact of donor killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype on outcomes of unrelated donor (URD) alloHCT for CLL is unknown. We examined 573 adult URD CLL recipient pairs. KIR genotype (presence/absence) was determined for each donor, and comprehensive modeling of interactions with recipient HLA class I loci (KIR ligands) was used to evaluate their effect on relapse and survival. Recipients had a median age of 56 years, and most were not in remission (65%). Both 8/8 HLA-matched (81%) or 7/8 HLA matched grafts (19%) were studied. Factors associated with improved overall survival (OS) were reduced-intensity conditioning (hazard ratio [HR] of death, .76) and good performance status (HR, .46), whereas alloHCT in nonremission (HR, 1.96) and mismatched donors (HR, 2.01) increased mortality. No models demonstrated a relationship between donor KIR genotype and transplant outcomes. Cox regression models comparing donors with A/A versus B/x KIR haplotypes and those with KIR gene content scores of 0 versus 1 versus >/=2 yielded similar rates of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD and the same progression-free survival and OS. Relapse risk was not different for grafts from donors with KIR3DL1 transplanted into HLA C1/1 versus C2 recipients. This large analysis failed to demonstrate an association between URD KIR genotype and transplant outcome for patients with CLL, and thus KIR genotyping should not be used as a donor selection criterion in this setting.","['Bachanova, Veronika', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Wang, Tao', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Cereb, Nezih', 'Haagenson, Michael D', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Guethlein, Lisbeth A', 'Parham, Peter', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Cooley, Sarah A']","['Bachanova V', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Wang T', 'Marsh SGE', 'Cereb N', 'Haagenson MD', 'Spellman SR', 'Lee SJ', 'Guethlein LA', 'Parham P', 'Miller JS', 'Cooley SA']",,"['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Vincristine and doxorubicin are commonly used for acute leukemia, but they may induce serious side effects such as cardiomyopathy and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, chemotherapy resistance occurs more and more frequently. Therefore, effective treatment strategies are needed. Histone deacetylase 6 inhibition is considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for acute leukemia, since it is observed that HDAC6 is overexpressed in acute leukemia and regulates tumor survival. Combination therapy for cancer is used to minimize adverse drug effects, reduce drug dosage, enhance efficacy, and prevent drug resistance. In order to improve efficacy of chemotherapy agents of acute leukemia, this study will investigate the effects of combination MPT0G211, a novel histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, with doxorubicin or vincristine on human acute leukemia cells. RESULTS: MPT0G211 combined with doxorubicin induces DNA damage response on human acute myeloid leukemia cells. MPT0G211 can additionally increase Ku70 acetylation and release BAX to mitochondria. Ectopic expression of HDAC6 successively reversed the apoptosis triggered by the combined treatment. Moreover, co-treatment of MPT0G211 and vincristine may alter microtubule dynamics, triggering acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells arrest in mitotic phase followed by induction of the apoptotic pathway. Finally, MPT0G211 plus doxorubicin or vincristine can significantly improve the tumor growth delay in a tumor xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data highlighted that MPT0G211 in combination with chemotherapy drugs has significant anticancer activity, suggesting a novel strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Tu, Huang-Ju', 'Lin, Yi-Jyun', 'Chao, Min-Wu', 'Sung, Ting-Yi', 'Wu, Yi-Wen', 'Chen, Yi-Ying', 'Lin, Mei-Hsiang', 'Liou, Jing-Ping', 'Pan, Shiow-Lin', 'Yang, Chia-Ron']","['Tu HJ', 'Lin YJ', 'Chao MW', 'Sung TY', 'Wu YW', 'Chen YY', 'Lin MH', 'Liou JP', 'Pan SL', 'Yang CR']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5990-1346'],"['School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No.33, Linsen S.

This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence and correlates of HBV, HCV, HDV, and HTLV 1&2 antibodies among MSM in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the biological and behavourial characteristics among MSM in Ouagadougou from January to April 2013. Serum specimens obtained were tested for the presence of HBV, HCV, HDV and HTLV-1&2 infections. MSM 18 years and older were recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). Population estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for the RDS design were calculated using RDS Analysis Tool (RDSAT) version 6.0.1 (RDS, Inc., Ithaca, NY). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess correlates of these infections using Stata 14. RESULTS: A total of 329 MSM were tested. Prevalence was 20.4% (95% CI: 16.4-25.1) for HBV, 11.0% (95% CI: 8.0-14.8) for HCV, and 0.0% for HDV. Anti-HTLV 1&2 antibodies were found in 4.0% (95% CI: 2.3-6.8) of MSM. Factors independently associated with HBV infection were lack of condom use during the last anal sex act with a main male sexual partner and experience of condom tearing during anal sex. Presence of anti-HTLV 1&2 antibodies was associated with history of genital or anal lesions and injection drug use. None of the variables included in our study were associated with HCV. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that HBV, HCV and HTLV 1&2 prevalence among MSM in Burkina is high and suggests that comprehensive STI prevention and sexual health education services for this group are needed.","['Ouedraogo, Henri Gautier', 'Kouanda, Seni', 'Grosso, Ashley', 'Compaore, Rebecca', 'Camara, Modibo', 'Dabire, Charlemagne', 'Ouedraogo, Rasmata', 'Traore, Yves', 'Baral, Stefan', 'Barro, Nicolas']","['Ouedraogo HG', 'Kouanda S', 'Grosso A', 'Compaore R', 'Camara M', 'Dabire C', 'Ouedraogo R', 'Traore Y', 'Baral S', 'Barro N']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8566-7530'],"['Biomedical and Public Health Department, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS), Ouagadougou, 03BP7192, Burkina Faso. gouedraogo@irss.bf.', 'University Ouaga1 Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. gouedraogo@irss.bf.', 'Institut Africain de Sante Publique, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. gouedraogo@irss.bf.', 'Biomedical and Public Health Department, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS), Ouagadougou, 03BP7192, Burkina Faso.', 'Institut Africain de Sante Publique, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Biomedical and Public Health Department, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS), Ouagadougou, 03BP7192, Burkina Faso.', 'Biomedical and Public Health Department, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS), Ouagadougou, 03BP7192, Burkina Faso.', 'Biomedical and Public Health Department, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS), Ouagadougou, 03BP7192, Burkina Faso.', 'University Ouaga1 Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'University Ouaga1 Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'University Ouaga1 Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Burkina Faso/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis D/*epidemiology', '*Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral/epidemiology']",PMC6311018,,2018/12/31 06:00,2019/01/22 06:00,['2018/12/31 06:00'],"['2018/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-018-1110-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-018-1110-8 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2018 Dec 29;15(1):194. doi: 10.1186/s12985-018-1110-8.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Burkina Faso', '*HBV', '*HCV', '*HDV', '*HTLV 1&2', '*MSM', '*West Africa']",,,20181229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of EBL in Japan is increasing annually; and the cases of EBL in cattle younger than 2 years old has been reported. Therefore, it is vital to find a method to control BLV infection, especially in young calves. In this study, to evaluate the protective ability of colostral antibodies against BLV infection, as well as the potential for BLV infection mediated by colostrum/milk, we investigated temporal fluctuations in the anti-BLV antibody titer and BLV proviral load (PVL) in colostrum/milk and peripheral blood of six infected dams during lactation. The association between PVL and antibody titer in colostrum and peripheral blood was then investigated using samples from a further twenty-seven cattle. Antibody concentrations were measured with a Syncytium-induction Inhibition Assay using colostral/milk whey and serum. PVL in peripheral blood and colostrum was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Colostral antibodies showed high inhibitory activity until day 3 of lactation. The antibody titer and PVL in peripheral blood showed lesser changes than those in colostrum/milk throughout lactation. The colostral antibody titer was significantly higher than the serum antibody titer in all samples, whereas the colostrum PVL was significantly lower than the blood PVL. The blood PVL showed a significant correlation with serum antibody titer, colostrum PVL, and colostral antibody titer. However, there were no major correlations between the serum and colostral antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report investigating the temporal changes in colostral antibody titer in terms of inhibiting BLV infection in vitro. The results of antibody detection by Syncytium-induction Inhibition Assay suggested that the protective activity of the colostral antibodies against BLV infection would be conferred by anti-BLV gp51 antibody. The high antibody titer of colostral whey suggests that colostral whey could be a potential source of antibodies with a low risk of infection in neonatal calves.","['Konishi, Misako', 'Ishizaki, Hiroshi', 'Kameyama, Ken-Ichiro', 'Murakami, Kenji', 'Yamamoto, Takehisa']","['Konishi M', 'Ishizaki H', 'Kameyama KI', 'Murakami K', 'Yamamoto T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8707-0639'],"['Epidemiology Unit, Division of Viral Disease and Epidemiology, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'Grazing Animal Unit, Division of Grassland Farming, Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science, NARO. 768 Senbonmatsu, Nasushiobara, Tochigi, 329-2793, Japan.', 'National Institute of Animal Health, NARO, Exotic Diseases Research Station Josuihoncho, Kodaira, Tokyo, 187-0022, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Iwate University Faculty of Agriculture, 3-18-8 Ueda, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Division of Viral Disease and Epidemiology, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan. mtbook@affrc.go.jp.']",['eng'],['26850203/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Colostrum/*immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology']",PMC6311012,,2018/12/31 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/12/31 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-018-1724-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-018-1724-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2018 Dec 29;14(1):419. doi: 10.1186/s12917-018-1724-5.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Colostral antibody', 'Prevention', 'Proviral load']",,,20181229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present that the hydrophobic unnatural base, 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds), which acts as a fifth letter in a DNA library, provides a series of high-affinity DNA aptamers with versatile binding specificities and activities to cancer cells. These Ds-containing DNA aptamers were generated by a method called cell-ExSELEX to target three breast cancer cell lines: MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D. Aptamer 14A-MCF7, which targets MCF7 cells, specifically binds to MCF7 cells, but not other cancer cell lines. Aptamer 07-MB231, which targets MDA-MB-231 cells, binds to a series of metastatic bone and lung cancer cell lines. Aptamer 05-MB231 targets MDA-MB-231 cells, but it also binds to all of the cancer and leukemia cell lines that we examined. None of these aptamers bind to normal cell lines, such as MCF10A and HUVEC. In addition, aptamers 14A-MCF7 and 05-MB231 are internalized within the cancer cells, and aptamer 05-MB231 possesses anti-proliferative properties against most cancer cell lines that we examined. These aptamers and the generation method are broadly applicable to cancer cell imaging, biomarker discovery, cancer cell profiling, anti-cancer therapies, and drug delivery systems.","['Futami, Kazunobu', 'Kimoto, Michiko', 'Lim, Yun Wei Shermane', 'Hirao, Ichiro']","['Futami K', 'Kimoto M', 'Lim YWS', 'Hirao I']",,"['TAGCyx Biotechnologies, Inc., Komaba Open Laboratory 403, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-0041, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan; Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, 31 Biopolis Way, The Nanos, #07-01, Singapore 138669, Singapore.', 'Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, 31 Biopolis Way, The Nanos, #07-01, Singapore 138669, Singapore; NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, 20 Clementi Avenue 1, Singapore 129957, Singapore.', 'RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan; Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, 31 Biopolis Way, The Nanos, #07-01, Singapore 138669, Singapore.

MUC1 is a polymorphic glycoprotein, the cleavage of which yields two unequal chains: a large extracellular alpha subunit containing a tandem repeat array bound in a strong noncovalent interaction to a smaller beta subunit containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Because the alpha-chain can be released from the cell-bound domains of MUC1, agents directed against the alpha-chain will not effectively target MUC1(+) cells. The MUC1 SEA (a highly conserved protein module so called from its initial identification in a sea urchin sperm protein, in enterokinase, and in agrin) domain formed by the binding of the alpha and beta chains represents a stable structure fixed to the cell surface at all times. DMB-5F3, a partially humanized murine anti-MUC1 SEA domain monoclonal antibody, was used to examine MUC1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was found to bind acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia (AML-M4 and AML-M5) cell lines. We also examined monocytic neoplasms freshly obtained from patients including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which were found to uniformly express MUC1. CD34(+)/lin(-)/CD38(-) or CD38(+) presumed leukemic stem cell populations from CD34(+) AML and CD34(-)CD38(-) or CD38(+) populations from CD34(-) AML were also found to express MUC1, although at low percentages. Based on these studies, we generated an anti-MUC1 immunotoxin to directly gauge the cytotoxic efficacy of targeting AML-bound MUC1. Using single-chain DMB-5F3 fused to recombinant gelonin toxin, the degree of AML cytotoxicity was found to correlate with MUC1 expression. Our data support the use of an anti-MUC1 SEA module-drug conjugates to selectively target and inhibit MUC1-expressing myelomonocytic leukemic cells.","['Guillaume, Thierry', 'Dehame, Virginie', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Peterlin, Pierre', 'Garnier, Alice', 'Gregoire, Marc', 'Pichinuk, Edward', 'Rubinstein, Daniel B', 'Wreschner, Daniel H']","['Guillaume T', 'Dehame V', 'Chevallier P', 'Peterlin P', 'Garnier A', 'Gregoire M', 'Pichinuk E', 'Rubinstein DB', 'Wreschner DH']",,"[""Division of Hematology, University Hospital Nantes, Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France; Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes Angers (CRCINA), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) 1232, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the current treatment of CML, but secondary mutations finally contribute to therapy resistance and blast crisis of the disease. The search for the novel compounds for the effective control of CML is now in the spotlight. The progression of CML to blast crisis is correlated with down-modulation of C/EBP alpha. Therefore, C/EBP alpha may be considered as a putative target in differentiation therapies in myeloid leukemias. The aim of the study was to assess the potential of vitamin E as the possible inducer of C/EBP alpha expression in BCR-ABL-positive CML K562 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA extracted from K562 cells cultured with valproic acid or vitamin E was converted to cDNA, RT-PCR reactions were carried out using HotStarTaq DNA polymerase with primers for C/EBP alpha and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). RESULTS: We have not found detectable expression of C/EBP alpha in K562 cells. Upon 48-h culture with vitamin E at a dose of 100 microM, K562 cells expressed both C/EBP alpha and G-CSFR. CONCLUSION: Vitamin E restored the expression of C/EBP alpha mRNA in chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. In this setting, G-CSFR expression in vitamin E treated K562 cells seems to suggest the activation to granulocytic differentiation. It should be further elucidated whether such effects of vitamin E on C/EBP alpha transcription factor are direct or mediated indirectly due to antioxidant properties of vitamin E.","['Shvachko, L P', 'Zavelevich, M P', 'Gluzman, D F', 'Kravchuk, I V', 'Telegeev, G D']","['Shvachko LP', 'Zavelevich MP', 'Gluzman DF', 'Kravchuk IV', 'Telegeev GD']",,"['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv 03680, Ukraine.', 'R.E.

TAM usually resolves spontaneously in </=3 months, but approximately 10% of patients with TAM die from hepatic or multi-organ failure. After remission, 20% of patients with TAM develop acute myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS). Blasts in both TAM and ML-DS have trisomy 21 and GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) mutations. Recent studies have shown that infants with DS and no clinical signs of TAM or increases in peripheral blood blasts can have minor clones carrying GATA1 mutations, referred to as silent TAM. Low-dose cytarabine can improve the outcomes of patients with TAM and high white blood cell count. A number of studies using fetal liver cells, mouse models, or induced pluripotent stem cells have elucidated the roles of trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations in the development of TAM. Next-generation sequencing of TAM and ML-DS patient samples identified additional mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation. Xenograft models of TAM demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of TAM blasts and mimic the process of clonal selection and expansion of TAM clones that leads to ML-DS. DNA methylation analysis suggests that epigenetic dysregulation may be involved in the progression from TAM to ML-DS. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis and identification of factors that predict progression to leukemia could assist in development of strategies to prevent progression to ML-DS. Investigation of TAM, a unique pre-leukemic condition, will continue to strongly influence basic and clinical research into the development of hematological malignancies.","['Watanabe, Kenichiro']",['Watanabe K'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8892-3082'],"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Aoi-ku, Shizuoka, Japan.""]",['eng'],['JP17 cm0106407h0002/AMED'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemoid Reaction/complications/*genetics', 'Mutation']",,,2018/12/30 06:00,2019/04/13 06:00,['2018/12/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13776 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2019 Mar;61(3):222-229. doi: 10.1111/ped.13776.

In leukemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable protein complex, AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC), that contains multiple transcription (co)factors. Among these AETFC components, HEB and E2A, two members of the ubiquitously expressed E proteins, directly interact with AML1-ETO, confer new DNA-binding capacity to AETFC, and are essential for leukemogenesis. However, the third E protein, E2-2, is specifically silenced in AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, suggesting E2-2 as a negative factor of leukemogenesis. Indeed, ectopic expression of E2-2 selectively inhibits the growth of AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, and this inhibition requires the bHLH DNA-binding domain. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses reveal that, despite some overlap, the three E proteins differentially regulate many target genes. In particular, studies show that E2-2 both redistributes AETFC to, and activates, some genes associated with dendritic cell differentiation and represses MYC target genes. In AML patients, the expression of E2-2 is relatively lower in the t(8;21) subtype, and an E2-2 target gene, THPO, is identified as a potential predictor of relapse. In a mouse model of human t(8;21) leukemia, E2-2 suppression accelerates leukemogenesis. Taken together, these results reveal that, in contrast to HEB and E2A, which facilitate AML1-ETO-mediated leukemogenesis, E2-2 compromises the function of AETFC and negatively regulates leukemogenesis. The three E proteins thus define a heterogeneity of AETFC, which improves our understanding of the precise mechanism of leukemogenesis and assists development of diagnostic/therapeutic strategies.","['Liu, Na', 'Song, Junhong', 'Xie, Yangyang', 'Wang, Xiao-Lin', 'Rong, Bowen', 'Man, Na', 'Zhang, Meng-Meng', 'Zhang, Qunling', 'Gao, Fei-Fei', 'Du, Mei-Rong', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Shen,

It is characterized by high rate of induction failure and the effective unified treatment strategies are still indeterminate. We present 2 ETP-ALL cases. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old man presented with abnormal hemogram for 4 months, intermittent fever for 2 months and cough for 1 week. A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for a fever and headache for that had persisted for 1 week. DIAGNOSIS: The peripheral blood examination, the bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometry for both patients revealed ETP-ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Both cases accepted chemotherapy including cytarabine. OUTCOMES: In case one, the patient reached complete hematological remission with negative minimal residual detected by flow cytometry after the first circle of chemotherapy. In case 2, the patient received complete remission after the second circle of chemotherapy with high doses of cytarabine. LESSONS: The application of the high-dose cytarabine in induction chemotherapy of ETP-ALL can bring better outcome. ETP-ALL with myeloid features may benefit from therapies used in myeloid malignancies.","['Wang, Xiao-Xue', 'Wu, Danyang', 'Zhang, Lijun']","['Wang XX', 'Wu D', 'Zhang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*pathology']",PMC6314700,,2018/12/30 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/12/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000013856 [doi]', '00005792-201812280-00063 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Dec;97(52):e13856. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000013856.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the anti-viral mechanism of ZAP has been elucidated, however, the tissue specificity and the viral infection correlativity have not been fully understood. Here, we tested the dynamic distribution and localization of chicken ZAP (chZAP) before and after avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection. The results showed that chZAP was highly expressed in adrenal gland and testis before ALV-J infection, and significantly upregulated in liver, kidney and bursa of Fabricius, and extremely overexpressed in spleen after ALV-J infection. The results indicated that chZAP is an inducible protein and showed specific overexpression in spleen after ALV-J infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chZAP, as a host intracytoplasmic factor, accumulated and migrated to the periphery of nucleus in DF-1 cells post-infection with ALV-J. Taken together, chZAP characterized as an inducible antiviral protein and specifically overexpressed in spleen after ALV-J infection.","['Zhu, Mingjun', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Ma, Xiaoqian', 'Li, Gen', 'He, Shuhai', 'Tang, Hao', 'Yao, Yongxiu', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Zhu M', 'Zhou J', 'Ma X', 'Li G', 'He S', 'Tang H', 'Yao Y', 'Cheng Z']",,"[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", 'Animal husbandry and veterinary station, Liuge zhuang town, 265114 Haiyang, Shandong province, China.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence on Avian Disease Research, Pirbright, Ash Road, Guildford, Surrey GU24 0NF, UK.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China.

Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.","['Lee, Daniel W', 'Santomasso, Bianca D', 'Locke, Frederick L', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Turtle, Cameron J', 'Brudno, Jennifer N', 'Maus, Marcela V', 'Park, Jae H', 'Mead, Elena', 'Pavletic, Steven', 'Go, William Y', 'Eldjerou, Lamis', 'Gardner, Rebecca A', 'Frey, Noelle', 'Curran, Kevin J', 'Peggs, Karl', 'Pasquini, Marcelo', 'DiPersio, John F', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M', 'Komanduri, Krishna V', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Neelapu, Sattva S']","['Lee DW', 'Santomasso BD', 'Locke FL', 'Ghobadi A', 'Turtle CJ', 'Brudno JN', 'Maus MV', 'Park JH', 'Mead E', 'Pavletic S', 'Go WY', 'Eldjerou L', 'Gardner RA', 'Frey N', 'Curran KJ', 'Peggs K', 'Pasquini M', 'DiPersio JF', 'van den Brink MRM', 'Komanduri KV', 'Grupp SA', 'Neelapu SS']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Kite, A Gilead Company, Foster City, CA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ.', ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Haematology, University College of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL.', ""Section of Cellular Therapy and Transplant, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

We compared C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)8 expression levels in the BM-MSCs of patients with AML and normal control subjects and detected significantly higher levels in the former. Furthermore, CXCL8 was up-regulated in cocultures of BM-MSCs and leukemic cell lines compared with either monoculture. CXCL8 expression was significantly higher in MSCs compared with mononuclear cells in patients with de novo AML. To elucidate the function of paracrine CXCL8 in AML, we blocked CXCL8 binding to the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor (CXCR)2 in the AML cells using SB225002. Inhibition of CXCL8/CXCR2 binding decreased proliferation in the AML cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis via decreased AKT phosphorylation. Blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor induced similar apoptosis induction and lower proliferation, suggesting that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also involved in CXCL8 action. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BM-MSCs are the main source of CXCL8 in the AML bone marrow microenvironment and promote leukemogenesis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating a novel therapeutic target.-Cheng, J., Li, Y., Liu, S., Jiang, Y., Ma, J., Wan, L., Li, Q., Pang, T.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to comprehensively assess the prognostic value of CDKN2A/B deletions in ALL patients. METHODS: Systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases up to July 2018. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with fixed-effects or random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of thirteen studies including 2857 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Combined HRs suggested that CDKN2A/B deletions were poor prognostic factors for both overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.82-2.54) and event-free survival (EFS)/disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.73-2.69). The adverse impact remained significant in both adult and paediatric ALL patients, and also in subgroups by ethnicity, ALL type, detection method of CDKN2A/B deletions, statistical method and endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that CDKN2A/B deletions were associated with poor prognosis independently in both adult and childhood ALL patients. Inclusion of CDKN2A/B status may further improve the risk stratification of ALL patients. Key Messages Although numerous studies have explored the prognostic significance of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletions in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients, the results remain conflicting. In this meta-analysis, we found that CDKN2A/B deletions were independent poor prognostic markers for both adult and paediatric ALL patients. Our findings justify the inclusion of CDKN2A/B status in the risk stratification of ALL patients.","['Zhang, Wanhua', 'Kuang, Pu', 'Liu, Ting']","['Zhang W', 'Kuang P', 'Liu T']",,"['a Department of Haematology , West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu , P.R.

METHODS: This study aimed to classify patients with leukemic LPD (n = 597, excluding hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphomas, and CD10-positive LPDs) into CLL or non-CLL applying three diagnostic strategies (the D'Arena and CLLflow scores and CD43 expression) and to better characterize unclassified patients. RESULTS: Patients with concurring CLL-like (n = 441) or non-CLL like (n = 99) results with the three diagnostic strategies were determined to have CLL and non-CLL, respectively. Patients with discordant results (n = 57) were analyzed taking into consideration each individual cytometric marker and cytogenetic data: 41 were classified (11 CLL, 30 non-CLL) and 16 (2.7% of the entire series) could not and were considered borderline LPD. Excluding borderline LPD, the CLLflow score had the highest accuracy of the three strategies. With the addition of CD43 no patient was misclassified. With the aid of hierarchical clustering, 12 of the 16 borderline patients seemed to fall into two well-defined antigenic groups. None of the diagnostic strategies could reliably pick out borderline LPD. CONCLUSION: The combination of the CLLflow score and CD43 generally has a high diagnostic accuracy for leukemic LPD but it is not reliable to identify or diagnose borderline LPD. This latter group needs further study to determine its underlying biology.

A peculiar paediatric entity.,337-347,10.1111/bjh.15725 [doi],"The scenario of paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), particularly non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (non-DS-AMKL), has been recently revolutionized by the advent of large-scale, genomic sequencing technologies. In this changing landscape, a significantly relevant discovery has been represented by the identification of the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene, which is the result of a cryptic inversion of chromosome 16. It is the most frequent chimeric oncogene identified to date in non-DS-AMKL, although it seems not to be exclusively restricted to the French-American-British M7 subgroup. The CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene characterizes a subtype of leukaemia that is specific to paediatrics, having never been identified in adults. It characterizes an extremely aggressive leukaemia, as the presence of this fusion is associated with a grim outcome in almost all of the case series reported, with overall survival rates ranging between 15% and 30%. Although the molecular basis that underlies this leukaemia subtype is still far from being completely elucidated, unique functional properties induced by CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in the leukaemogenesis driving process have been recently identified. We here review the peculiarities of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive AML, describing its intriguing clinical and biological behaviour and providing some challenging targeting opportunities.","['Masetti, Riccardo', 'Bertuccio, Salvatore N', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Masetti R', 'Bertuccio SN', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1264-057X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5428-6716', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7976-3654']","['Department of Paediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Haematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Haematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Haematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology and Cell and Gene Therapy, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (GLIS2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6590351,,2018/12/29 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2018/12/29 06:00'],"['2018/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15725 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Feb;184(3):337-347. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15725.

The aim of this study is to describe the incidence, risk factors, clinical course, and outcome of PRES in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Patients aged 1.0 to 17.9 years diagnosed with ALL from July 2008 to December 2015 and treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol were included. Patients with PRES were identified in the prospective NOPHO leukemia toxicity registry, and clinical data were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: The study group included 1378 patients, of whom 52 met the criteria for PRES. The cumulative incidence of PRES at one month was 1.7% (95% CI, 1.1-2.5) and at one year 3.7% (95% CI, 2.9-4.9). Older age (hazard ratios [HR] for each one-year increase in age 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2, P = 0.001) and T-cell immunophenotype (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.3, P = 0.0005) were associated with PRES. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement (odds ratios [OR] = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.5, P = 0.015) was associated with early PRES and high-risk block treatment (HR = 2.63; 95% CI, 1.1-6.4, P = 0.033) with late PRES. At follow-up of the PRES patients, seven patients had epilepsy and seven had neurocognitive difficulties. CONCLUSION: PRES is a neurotoxicity in the treatment of childhood ALL with both acute and long-term morbidity. Older age, T-cell leukemia, CNS involvement and high-risk block treatment are risk factors for PRES.","['Anastasopoulou, Stavroula', 'Eriksson, Mats A', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Wang, Chen', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Mikkel, Sirje', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda E', 'Johannsdottir, Inga Maria', 'Myrberg, Ida Hed', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Als-Nielsen, Bodil', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Banerjee, Joanna', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Ranta, Susanna']","['Anastasopoulou S', 'Eriksson MA', 'Heyman M', 'Wang C', 'Niinimaki R', 'Mikkel S', 'Vaitkeviciene GE', 'Johannsdottir IM', 'Myrberg IH', 'Jonsson OG', 'Als-Nielsen B', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Banerjee J', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Ranta S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4210-0064', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0190-5664', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0829-4993', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2767-5828']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Oulu University Hospital, Department of Children and Adolescents, and University of Oulu, PEDEGO Research Unit, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', ""Children's Hospital, affiliation of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, and Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, and Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Epilepsy/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/etiology/pathology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology/*therapy', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seizures/etiology/pathology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects']",,,2018/12/29 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2018/12/29 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27594 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 May;66(5):e27594. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27594.

Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often induces complete remission and these patients subsequently undergo an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, 20% of subjects experience a relapse associated with the selection of point-mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. We report the clinical evolution of a Philadelphia-positive ALL patient co-expressing the e1a2 and e14a2 BCR-ABL transcript at diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was used to detect BCR-ABL transcripts and their levels were measured by quantitative Real Time PCR. Clonal sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to identify mutations. RESULTS: Although the patient underwent ASCT following treatment with multiple TKIs, he relapsed twice. The first time he exhibited the e1a2 transcript and the second time he presented only the e14a2 variant. Mutation analysis, performed by clonal sequencing and NGS, detected two alterations after the first relapse and a single mutation at the time of the second relapse. CONCLUSION: The observed shift from the e1a2 to the e14a2 variant and the selection of TKI-resistant clones heavily contributed to the fatal evolution of the disease.","['Stella, Stefania', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Scalise, Luca', 'Leotta, Salvatore', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Sapienza, Giuseppe', 'Milone, Giuseppe', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Stella S', 'Massimino M', 'Tirro E', 'Vitale SR', 'Scalise L', 'Leotta S', 'Pennisi MS', 'Puma A', 'Romano C', 'Stagno F', 'Sapienza G', 'Milone G', 'Manzella L']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy stefania.stel@gmail.com.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

The effects of estrogens are mediated via nuclear estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta). This study investigated the potential functions of ligand-activated ERs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ER mRNA expression in B lymphocytes isolated from patients with CLL was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. To evaluate the effects of ERbeta signaling, primary CLL cells and CLL-derived MEC1 cells were treated with selective ERbeta agonists. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of ERalpha, ERbeta1 and its splice variant ERbeta2 was detected in CLL cells. Selective ERbeta agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionitrile induced apoptosis in primary CLL cells and suppressed the growth of CLL-derived MEC1 cells. CONCLUSION: A suppressive effect of ERbeta agonists on the growth of ERbeta-expressing CLL cells was found, indicating that ERbeta may be considered as a potential therapeutic target in CLL.","['Hasni, Mohammad Sharif', 'Yakimchuk, Konstantin']","['Hasni MS', 'Yakimchuk K']",,"['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Neo, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden konstantin.yakimchuk@ki.se.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/agonists/*genetics', 'Estrogens/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,,2018/12/29 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/12/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['39/1/167 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13093 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jan;39(1):167-172. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13093.,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cells', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'estrogen receptors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daratumumab is the most advanced anti-CD38 mAb in the clinical development with approval in several indications, nevertheless isatuximab that targets completely different epitope of CD38 molecule is also very promising drug. Anti-CD38 possess pleiotropic mechanism of action that have been described also in other mAbs, but quite specific, novel and very important seems to be the immunomodulatory effect provided by depletion of several CD38+ immunosuppressive immune cell populations. CD38-targeted mAbs induce partial response or better in approximately 30 % of heavily pre-treated myeloma patients as monotherapy. Based on their favourable toxicity profile and distinct mechanism of action, anti-CD38 mAbs represents very attractive partner to back-bone anti-myeloma drugs. Indeed, daratumumab is already approved as a part of three distinct combination regimens in relapsed setting. The combination of daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is considered to be the best treatment option in relapsed myeloma with unprecedented prolongation of median PFS, including high rate of good quality responses. CD38 targeted therapy is rapidly moving toward the first line treatment. Anti-CD38 mAbs have been also successfully tested in other plasma cell dyscrasias (such as AL amyloidosis), and they are examined in other hematological malignancies (such as CLL, ALL, AML, etc.) and even in solid oncology as well as in autoimmune disorders. Implementation of CD38 targeted mAbs have been significant milestone in the treatment of MM, similar to that of CD20 targeted mAbs in CLL or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We believe that this drug may eventually help to reach the cure at least in a subset of MM patients in the near future.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is appropriate for test of these postulates, having three phases differing in symptom severity and prior treatment experiences: indolent disease requiring no treatment (active surveillance; AS), symptomatic disease requiring a first treatment (FT), and highly symptomatic disease in those who have relapsed and/or failed to respond to prior treatments (relapsed/refractory; RR). PURPOSE: To test symptom severity and prior treatment experiences as determinants of illness perceptions, illness perceptions were characterized and contrasted between CLL groups. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty CLL patients (AS, n = 100; FT, n = 78; RR, n = 152) provided illness perception data on one occasion during a surveillance visit (AS) or prior to beginning treatment (FT, RR). RESULTS: Analysis of variance with planned comparisons revealed that consequences, identity, and concern were least favorable among RR patients, followed by FT, then AS (ps < .01). AS patients endorsed the lowest levels of coherence (ps < .01), and the most chronic illness timeline (ps < .01). FT patients endorsed the highest levels of personal and treatment control (ps < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Data provide preliminary empirical support for Self-regulatory Model postulates that symptom severity and prior disease experiences influence illness perceptions. Unique knowledge needs for AS patients and elevated psychological/physical symptoms for later-stage CLL patients may warrant clinical attention.","['Westbrook, Travis D', 'Morrison, Eleshia J', 'Maddocks, Kami J', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Andersen, Barbara L']","['Westbrook TD', 'Morrison EJ', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Awan FT', 'Jones JA', 'Woyach JA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Andersen BL']",,"['Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic Rochester.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus.', 'Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA098133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Behav Med,Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,8510246,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Psychological', 'Self-Control/*psychology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Watchful Waiting']",PMC6696900,,2018/12/28 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['5261322 [pii]', '10.1093/abm/kay093 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Behav Med. 2019 Aug 16;53(9):839-848. doi: 10.1093/abm/kay093.,"['(c) Society of Behavioral Medicine 2018.

The treatments of NPC, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were effective, but they also caused some severe side effects. Erianin, a natural product derived from Dendrobium, was proved to have anti-cancer effect in hepatoma, melanoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, myelogenous leukemia, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: According to previous research, we hypothesized that erianin inhibits cancer cell growth through apoptotic mechanisms. This study aimed to determine whether Erianin has an anti-NPC effect and what mechanisms were involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: The result showed that erianin significantly increased activation of apoptosis in NPC cell lines (NPC-039 and NPC-BM) and arrest the cell cycle obviously through mitochondrial membrane alternation, death receptors activation, and caspase-3, -8, -9 activation. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was also decreased in erianin-treated NPC cell with dose-dependent manner, and the result was thought to promote apoptosis. Furthermore, the increased rate of apoptotic cells with erianin plus it's inhibitors (U) was also revealed in this study. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this is the first research to identify the anti-NPC effect of erianin via the apoptosis mechanism. Erianin was a promising natural agent against nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","['Liu, Yen-Tze', 'Hsieh, Ming-Ju', 'Lin, Jen-Tsun', 'Chen, Gene', 'Lin, Chia-Chieh', 'Lo, Yu-Sheng', 'Chuang, Yi-Ching', 'Hsi, Yi-Ting', 'Chen, Mu-Kuan', 'Chou, Ming-Chih']","['Liu YT', 'Hsieh MJ', 'Lin JT', 'Chen G', 'Lin CC', 'Lo YS', 'Chuang YC', 'Hsi YT', 'Chen MK', 'Chou MC']",,"['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 402, Taiwan; Department of Family Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan; Department of Holistic Wellness, MingDao University, Changhua, 52345, Taiwan; Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 402, Taiwan; Department of Holistic Wellness, MingDao University, Changhua, 52345, Taiwan; Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, 404, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 402, Taiwan.', 'Southridge School, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.', 'Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.', 'Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.', 'Oral Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 500, Taiwan.

Given the paucity of data supporting the routine practice of post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis for ALL in the contemporary era, this position statement is anticipated to further stoke controversy and discussion within the transplantation community.

The growing body of evidence suggesting that gastrointestinal inflammation is involved in the development of PD led us to investigate the effects of inflammation on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat ENS and in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Using western blot and qPCR, we found that both lipopolysaccharide and a combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1-beta decreased the expression levels of alpha-synuclein in primary culture of rat ENS, an effect that was prevented in the presence of the p38 inhibitors SB203580 and BIRB 796. Lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin 1-beta had no effect on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat CNS and in human erythroid leukemia cells. In mice, acute but not chronic dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis was associated with a decreased expression of colonic alpha-synuclein. As a whole, our findings indicate that acute inflammatory insults down-regulate alpha-synuclein expression in the ENS via a p38 pathway. They provide new insights into the widely discussed concepts of alpha-synuclein expression and aggregation in the ENS in PD and raise issues about the possible role of gastrointestinal inflammation in the development of PD.

Clinical practice varies and the value of frequent follow-up visits remains unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated the clinical value of follow-up visits for patients with CLL. METHODS: We collected data from diagnosis and follow-up visits for patients diagnosed with CLL and managed by WAW in the North Denmark Region between 2007-2014. High- and low-risk group patients were determined by Binet stage, IgVH status, and cytogenetics at diagnosis. The effect of risk group allocation on the probability of receiving CLL-directed treatment within two years was included in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age and blood test results. RESULTS: 273 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 3 years (IQR: 1.6-5.4). Overall, the median interval between follow-up visits was 98 days (95% CI: 96-100) (high-risk patients: 91 days [95% CI: 86-95] vs. low-risk patients: 105 days [95% CI: 100-110]). Among 2,312 follow-up visits, only 387 (17%) were associated with interventions. At the following time points: 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years, patients with low-risk CLL had significantly lower odds of initiating treatment compared to patients with high-risk CLL. CONCLUSION: WAW plays an important role in managing CLL. Interventions at follow-up visits were infrequent and low-risk patients had significantly lower risk of treatment initiation. We question the value of routine follow-up in CLL in the absence of changes in symptoms and/or blood test results.","['Norgaard, Caroline Holm', 'Sogaard, Nikoline Buus', 'Biccler, Jorne Lionel', 'Pilgaard, Laura', 'Eskesen, Mathias Holmsgaard', 'Kjartansdottir, Thordis Helga', 'Bogsted, Martin', 'El-Galaly, Tarec Christoffer']","['Norgaard CH', 'Sogaard NB', 'Biccler JL', 'Pilgaard L', 'Eskesen MH', 'Kjartansdottir TH', 'Bogsted M', 'El-Galaly TC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3279-4872'],"['Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Unit of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Office Visits/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time-to-Treatment/statistics & numerical data/*trends', '*Watchful Waiting']",PMC6307783,,2018/12/28 06:00,2019/05/23 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0208180 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-05990 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Dec 27;13(12):e0208180. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0208180. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181227,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional treatments are associated with cytotoxicity and systemic side effects. Hence, efforts in the field of cancer treatment are focused on finding the strategies which can specifically target the tumor cells without affecting the normal cells. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a biological cytokine which has the mentioned specificity, but the resistance of some cancer cells limits its use as a therapeutic strategy. Recent studies have shown that quercetin (QUR) can be used as a sensitizing agent alongside with TRAIL. The present study showed that QUR can increase the effect of TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in KG-1 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive study, the IC50 dose for QUR in the KG-1 cell line was first determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Then, the cells were treated with TRAIL and QUR for 12, 24, and 48 hr. The rate of apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/propidium iodide assay. Also, the molecular evaluation of candidate genes was accomplished before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The results indicated that QUR could sensitize the KG-1 cells against the TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This outcome is achieved by increasing the messenger RNA expression levels of the death receptor genes and reducing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, as well as decreasing the expression of the NF-kappaB subunit. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that QUR can sensitize the acute myeloid KG-1 cells against TRAIL. Moreover, the combinational therapy of these agents might promisingly improve the clinical efficacy of TRAIL in patients with AML.","['Naimi, Adel', 'Entezari, Atefeh', 'Hagh, Majid Farshdousti', 'Hassanzadeh, Ali', 'Saraei, Raedeh', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Naimi A', 'Entezari A', 'Hagh MF', 'Hassanzadeh A', 'Saraei R', 'Solali S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6683-6845', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6487-3551']","['Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,,2018/12/28 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):13233-13241. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27995.

The aim was to investigate the relationships of these two markers with some prognostic factors and with survival of the children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Livin and survivin expression was investigated quantitatively by immunohistochemistry staining technique in 43 primary formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow blocks in pediatric age group (<18 years). RESULTS: Both survivin and livin were expressed in 81.4% of AML patients. Livin expression showed significant positive association with high level of primary WBC (p = .002). Survivin expression showed significant positive correlations with risk of relapse (p </= .001) and high level of primary WBC (p = .003). The relationship of overall survival (OS) of the patients with livin and survivin expression, were investigated separately in disease subtypes. Significant association was observed between survivin expression and shorter OS regardless of subtypes including acute promyelocytic (APL) (p = .01) and nonacute promyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) (p = .008). Also, significant association of livin expression with shorter OS was detected, but only in APL subgroup (p = .046). Nevertheless, in Cox regression model after adjusting for disease subtypes, stage and cytogenetics; survivin and livin showed no significant association with OS (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Livin and survivin showed significant associations with some poor prognostic factors of AML. Although survivin in both subtypes and livin in non APL subtype, showed a significant relationship with shorter OS, none of them was determined as independent prognostic factors. Further studies with larger sample size are suggested.","['Zareifar, Soheila', 'Ghorbani, Soudeh', 'Monabbati, Ahmad', 'Bordbar, Mohammad Reza', 'Zekavat, Omid Reza', 'Abdolkarimi, Babak', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh']","['Zareifar S', 'Ghorbani S', 'Monabbati A', 'Bordbar MR', 'Zekavat OR', 'Abdolkarimi B', 'Haghpanah S']",,"['a Hematology Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.', 'a Hematology Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.', 'b Department of Pathology and Hematopathology research center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.', 'a Hematology Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.', 'a Hematology Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.', 'c Department of Pediatrics , Lorestan University of Medical Sciences , Khoramabad , Iran.', 'a Hematology Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BIRC7 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivin/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/28 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2018.1530702 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 May;35(4):250-256. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2018.1530702.

However, it is a great challenge to discriminate 5-hmC from 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) using the conventional bisulfite conversion methods. Herein, we report a label-free and immobilization-free electrochemical magnetobiosensor for sensitive quantification of 5-hmC in genomic DNA based on a dual signal amplification strategy coupled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT) enzymatic amplification and Ru(III) redox cycling. This screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE)-based electrochemical magnetobiosensor shows distinct advantages of having low cost and simple fabrication and being label-free, immobilization-free, PCR-free, and radioactive-free. It exhibits high sensitivity with a detection limit of as low as 9.06 fM and a large dynamic range from 0.01 to 1000 pM. Importantly, this biosensor can discriminate 5-hmC from cytosine and 5-mC, and it can successfully detect 5-hmC in live cells.","['Cui, Lin', 'Hu, Juan', 'Wang, Meng', 'Li, Chen-Chen', 'Zhang, Chun-Yang']","['Cui L', 'Hu J', 'Wang M', 'Li CC', 'Zhang CY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8010-1981'],"['College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes, Ministry of Education, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan , Shandong 250014 , PR China.', 'College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes, Ministry of Education, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan , Shandong 250014 , PR China.', 'College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes, Ministry of Education, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan , Shandong 250014 , PR China.', 'College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes, Ministry of Education, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan , Shandong 250014 , PR China.', 'College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes, Ministry of Education, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan , Shandong 250014 , PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Ferricyanides)', '0 (Ruthenium Compounds)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '13408-62-3 (hexacyanoferrate III)', '19052-44-9 (hexammineruthenium)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Carbon/chemistry', 'DNA/*analysis/chemistry', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/chemistry', 'Electrochemical Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Electrodes', 'Ferricyanides/chemistry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Magnetic Phenomena', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Ruthenium Compounds/chemistry']",,,2018/12/28 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04663 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 Jan 15;91(2):1232-1236. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04663.

We present our 21 years experience with sperm cryopreservation for cancer patients, including an examination of semen quality, the current status of cryopreserved sperm, and the rate of sperm use for assisted reproductive technology (ART). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 721 cancer patients at Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center successfully performed sperm cryopreservation for fertility preservation from January 1996 to December 2016. Medical chart review was used to analyze patient age, marital status, cancer type, semen volume, sperm counts and motility, length of storage, and current banking status. RESULTS: The major cancers of the 721 patients were leukemia (28.4%), lymphoma (18.3%), testis cancer (10.0%). The mean age at cryopreservation was 27.0 years, and 111 patients (15.4%) performed sperm cryopreservation during or after cancer treatment. The mean sperm concentration was 66.7+/-66.3 x10(6)/mL and the mean sperm motility was 33.8%+/-16.3%. During median follow-up duration of 75 months (range, 1-226 months), 44 patients (6.1%) used their banked sperm at our fertility center for ART and 9 patients (1.2%) transferred their banked sperm to another center. The median duration from cryopreservation to use was 51 months (range, 1-158 months). CONCLUSIONS: Sperm cryopreservation before gonadotoxic treatment is the most reliable method to preserve the fertility of male cancer patients. Sperm cryopreservation should be offered as a standard of care for all men planning cancer therapy.","['Song, Seung Hun', 'Kim, Dae Keun', 'Sung, Su Ye', 'Her, Young Sun', 'Lee, Ok Hee', 'Choi, Myoung Hwa', 'Kim, Hae Kyung', 'Lyu, Sang Woo', 'Kim, Dong Suk']","['Song SH', 'Kim DK', 'Sung SY', 'Her YS', 'Lee OH', 'Choi MH', 'Kim HK', 'Lyu SW', 'Kim DS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4649-9129', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3237-6304', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4581-3182', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3678-2801', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5405-0909', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3364-2427', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9096-9370', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5572-0898', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7350-0303']","['Department of Urology, Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Urology, CHA Fertility Center, Seoul Station, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. dngskkim100@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['2018R1C1B5083794/NRF/National Research Foundation of Korea/Korea'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),World J Mens Health,The world journal of men's health,101596899,,,,PMC6479079,,2018/12/28 06:00,2018/12/28 06:01,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/28 06:01 [medline]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['36.e52 [pii]', '10.5534/wjmh.180061 [doi]']",ppublish,World J Mens Health. 2019 May;37(2):219-225. doi: 10.5534/wjmh.180061.

MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA, has been reported to be associated with cancer progression and prognosis. Thus, we here determined MALAT1 gene expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a genetically heterogeneous disease, and explored its possible relationships with cytogenetic abnormalities. Methods: MALAT1 expression level was evaluated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on blood mononuclear cells from 30 non-treated CLL patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Cytogenetic abnormalities were determined in patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: MALAT1 expression level was up-regulated in the CLL group compared to healthy controls (P=0.008). Del13q14, followed by Del11q22, were the most prevalent cytogenetic abnormalities. We found no association between the FISH results and MALAT1 expression in patients. Conclusion: Altered expression of MALAT1 is associated with CLL development. Further investigations are required to assess the relationship between this long non-coding RNA and CLL patient survival and prognosis.","['Ahmadi, Abdolrahim', 'Kaviani, Saeid', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Pashaiefar, Hossein', 'Ahmadvand, Mohammad', 'Jalili, Mahdi', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Eslamijouybari, Mohammad', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Ahmadi A', 'Kaviani S', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Pashaiefar H', 'Ahmadvand M', 'Jalili M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Eslamijouybari M', 'Ghavamzadeh A']",,"['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Science, Sari, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6300670,,2018/12/28 06:00,2018/12/28 06:01,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.4.320 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Dec;53(4):320-324. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.4.320.

Moreover, IDO has the ability to convert CD4(+)CD25(-) conventional T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this study, we evaluated the expression of IDO in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients and its correlation with the Treg marker, FOXP3, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed CN-AML patients were enrolled in our study along with 22 healthy individuals. The expression of the IDO and FOXP3 genes was analyzed by SYBR Green real-time PCR. Results: Both IDO and FOXP3 were highly upregulated in CN-AML patients compared to control groups (P=0.004 and P=0.031, respectively). A positive correlation was observed between IDO and FOXP3 expression among AML patients (r=0.512, P=0.001). Expression of IDO and FOXP3 showed no significant correlation with laboratory parameters such as white blood cell and platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, bone marrow blast percentage, gender, and FLT3 mutation status (P>0.05).

Its clinicohematological and cytogenetic features play a significant role in determining the clinical course and in predicting the treatment response and prognosis. In this context, 17p deletion is known to predict a poor prognosis, as these cases are refractory to conventional therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicohematological characteristics, outcomes, and prognostic factors among CLL patients with and without del 17p in Pakistan. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (Rawalpindi, Pakistan) between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were diagnosed based on the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia IWCLL criteria, their clinicohematological parameters were recorded, and cytogenetic analyses were performed. The time from diagnosis to treatment and the 2-year overall survival rate were also evaluated. Results: We evaluated 130 CLL cases, including 24 patients (18.5%) with del 17p, who included 18 men (75%) and 6 women (25%). The median age was 68 years. Binet stage C was detected at the presentation in 16 patients (67%). Treatment was administered to 14 patients (70%) at a median interval of 11 months (range, 0-28 mo) after diagnosis. The overall response rate was 64.3%, the median event-free survival was 9 months (range, 1-23 mo), and the 2-year overall survival rate was 65%. Conclusion: Del 17p is relatively common in Pakistan, and patients harboring this deletion had poor treatment response and survival outcomes.","['Mahmood, Rafia', 'Khan, Saleem Ahmed', 'Altaf, Chaudhry', 'Malik, Hamid Saeed', 'Khadim, Muhammad Tahir']","['Mahmood R', 'Khan SA', 'Altaf C', 'Malik HS', 'Khadim MT']",,"['Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6300684,,2018/12/28 06:00,2018/12/28 06:01,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.4.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Dec;53(4):276-280. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.4.276.

IR-induced depletion of neural stem/progenitor cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus where neurogenesis occurs is considered largely responsible for deficiencies such as learning, memory, and spatial information processing in patients subjected to cranial irradiation. Similarly, IR therapy-induced intestinal injuries such as diarrhea and malabsorption are common side effects in patients with gastrointestinal tumors and are believed to be caused by intestinal stem cell drop out. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently used to reinstate blood production in leukemia patients and pre-clinical treatments show promising results in other organs such as the skin and kidney, but ethical issues and logistic problems make this route difficult to follow. An alternative way to restore the injured tissue is to preserve the stem cell pool located in that specific tissue/organ niche, but stem cell response to ionizing radiation is inadequately understood at the molecular mechanistic level. Although embryonic and fetal hypersensity to IR has been very well known for many decades, research on embryonic stem cell models in culture concerning molecular mechanisms have been largely inconclusive and often in contradiction of the in vivo observations. This review will summarize the latest discoveries on stem cell radiosensitivity, highlighting the possible molecular and epigenetic mechanism(s) involved in DNA damage response and programmed cell death after ionizing radiation therapy specific to normal stem cells. Finally, we will analyze the possible contribution of stem cell-specific chromatin's epigenetic constitution in promoting normal stem cell radiosensitivity.","['Fabbrizi, Maria Rita', 'Warshowsky, Kacie E', 'Zobel, Cheri L', 'Hallahan, Dennis E', 'Sharma, Girdhar G']","['Fabbrizi MR', 'Warshowsky KE', 'Zobel CL', 'Hallahan DE', 'Sharma GG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1420-5579'],"['1Cancer Biology Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '1Cancer Biology Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '1Cancer Biology Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '1Cancer Biology Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '2Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '1Cancer Biology Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6', '2Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63108 USA.0000 0001 2355 7002grid.4367.6']",['eng'],['R01 CA174966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,PMC6299079,,2018/12/28 06:00,2018/12/28 06:01,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-018-0132-8 [doi]', '132 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2018 Dec 18;4:117. doi: 10.1038/s41420-018-0132-8. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181218,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine CA I and II autoantibodies in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and to provide a novel perspective regarding the autoimmune basis of the disease. Autoantibody levels were investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum samples from 37 patients with CLL and 37 healthy peers. Anti-CA I titres in the CLL group were significantly higher compared with the control group (p = 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between CLL and control groups in terms of anti-CA II titres (p = 0.278). The prevalences of CA I and II autoantibodies in patients with CLL in this study were 27% and 24.3%, respectively.

Notably, an increased incidence of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), which is related to immunological conditions, appears to be predictive of a favorable outcome for dasatinib therapy. We therefore examined the immunological characteristics of CML patients during dasatinib therapy by determining the plasma concentrations of five different biomarkers. Methods: The plasma levels of biomarkers, specifically interleukin-6, platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, and soluble cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (sCTLA-4), were measured by ELISA at baseline and after 2 and 6 months of TKI treatment. The incidence of LGLs was estimated by microscopic examination. Results: The levels of PDMPs, sVCAM-1, and TGFbeta1 were significantly elevated in patients with CML. Dasatinib treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the levels of these markers and with an increased incidence of LGLs compared with imatinib or nilotinib treatment. In addition, an increased incidence of LGLs was significantly correlated with a decreased sCTLA-4 level during dasatinib therapy. Conclusion: The assessment of the levels of specific biomarkers may be beneficial to understand the immunological conditions of patients with CML during dasatinib treatment.","['Nomura, Shosaku', 'Ito, Tomoki', 'Satake, Atsushi', 'Ishii, Kazuyoshi']","['Nomura S', 'Ito T', 'Satake A', 'Ishii K']",,"['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan, shosaku-n@mbp.ocn.ne.jp.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan, shosaku-n@mbp.ocn.ne.jp.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan, shosaku-n@mbp.ocn.ne.jp.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan, shosaku-n@mbp.ocn.ne.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,PMC6305157,,2018/12/28 06:00,2018/12/28 06:01,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S187005 [doi]', 'jbm-10-001 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2018 Dec 19;10:1-8. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S187005. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'LGL', 'PDMP', 'TGFbeta1', 'TKI', 'sCTLA-4']",,,20181219,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were fully searched to find eligible studies regarding platinum use during pregnancy in women with cervical cancer from January 1980 to September 2018. Data were extracted from the selected studies independently by two authors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical data (frequency and percentage) and numeration data (mean and SD for normally distributed data and median and range for abnormally distributed data). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests to estimate overall survival and progression-free survival for all patients. Results: A total of 39 studies including 88 cervical cancer patients with platinum administration during pregnancy were selected in this meta-analysis, and 64 women provided International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage information. Among the latter, 56 of 64 (87.5%) were diagnosed with early stages (I and IIA) and the remaining 8 of 64 (12.5%) had advanced stages (IIB, III, and IV). In relation to cisplatin, 86 pregnant women were identified, whereas only 2 pregnant women with carboplatin application were retrieved. Overall, 88 newborns were delivered from 84 pregnancies, including two sets of twins and one set of triplets, among which 71 neonates (71 of 88, 80.7%) were completely healthy at birth. All children were healthy at the end of follow-up (median 17 months, range 0-149.5 months), except one who was diagnosed with retroperitoneal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma at 5 years old and one who had acute myeloid leukemia at 22 months of age. At the end of follow-up (range 4.75-156 months), 16 of 81 (19.8%) patients were diagnosed with recurrence of cervical cancer, and 11 (90%) of those died because of cancer relapse. Neither median overall survival nor median progression-free survival were reached. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy could be a favorable choice for the management of patients with cervical cancer during the second and third trimesters. To reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, cisplatin might be good to use as monotherapy in these patients.","['Song, Yizuo', 'Liu, Yi', 'Lin, Min', 'Sheng, Bo', 'Zhu, Xueqiong']","['Song Y', 'Liu Y', 'Lin M', 'Sheng B', 'Zhu X']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Live Birth', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy/adverse effects/mortality', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', '*Pregnancy Trimester, Second', '*Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Young Adult']",PMC6304076,,2018/12/28 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S186966 [doi]', 'dddt-13-079 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2018 Dec 19;13:79-102. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S186966. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cervical cancer', 'meta-analysis', 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy', 'platinum', 'pregnancy']",,,20181219,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children (age-1-14 y) treated for Leukemia of our center who completed treatment between January and August 2016 were included in the study. Serum ferritin and iron were measured at completion of treatment and total blood transfusion received throughout treatment was quantified. Serum ferritin >1000 ng/mL was considered as marker of transfusional iron overload. RESULTS: Out of 66 participants, 55 (83.3%) received red cell transfusions. Average transfused volume was 48 mL/kg, and patients with high-risk leukemia received more transfusions than standard-risk patients. 16 patients (24.2%) demonstrated transfusional iron overload. Total transfused volume and treatment intensity were significant factors associated with iron overload, and total transfused volume of >100 mL/kg (approximately 10 transfusions) was the most important determinant of transfusional iron burden. CONCLUSIONS: One-fourth of pediatric leukemia patients demonstrated iron overload at the end of treatment. These patients need to be monitored and followed-up after treatment to assess need for later chelation therapy.","['Nair, Manjusha', 'Kuttath, Vijayalakshmi', 'Nair, Amita Radhakrishnan', 'Rajeswari, Binitha', 'Chellappan, Guruprasad', 'Thankamony, Priyakumari', 'Parukkutty, Kusumakumary']","['Nair M', 'Kuttath V', 'Nair AR', 'Rajeswari B', 'Chellappan G', 'Thankamony P', 'Parukkutty K']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Regional Cancer Center, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.

In the present study, we investigated whether or not MA affects immune responses in a leukemia mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WEHI-3 cells were intraperitonealIy (i.p.) injected into normal BALB/c mice to develop leukemia. Mice were then treated by i.p. injection with MA at different doses (0, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. After treatment, all animals were weighed and blood, liver and spleen tissues were weighed. Blood or spleen both were used for determination of cell markers or phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activities and T- and B-cell proliferation, respectively, by using a flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: MA did not significantly affect body, liver, and spleen weights. However, MA increased markers of T-cells (at 16 mg/kg treatment) and monocytes (at 32 mg/kg treatment), but reduced B-cell markers (at 8 mg/kg treatment); MA did not significantly affect cell marker of macrophages. Furthermore, MA increased phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal cavity at 32 mg/kg treatment and increased NK cell activity at target cell:splenocyte ratio of 25:1 but did not affect B- and T-cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: MA increased immune responses by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and NK cell activities in leukemic mice.","['Lai, Kuang-Chi', 'Peng, Shu-Fen', 'Liu, Chia-Chi', 'Huang, Jye-Yu', 'Kuo, Jung-Yu', 'Cheng, Zheng-Yu', 'Wu, Rick Sai-Chuen', 'Lin, Chin-Chung', 'Chen, Jr-Kai', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Lai KC', 'Peng SF', 'Liu CC', 'Huang JY', 'Kuo JY', 'Cheng ZY', 'Wu RS', 'Lin CC', 'Chen JK', 'Chung JG']",,"['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine and Life Science, Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Surgery, China Medical University Beigang Hospital, Beigang, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering and Environmental Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Chinese Medicine, Feng-Yuan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Executive Yuan, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'General Education Center, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Chang Bing Show-Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, R.O.C. jgchung@mail.cmu.edu.tw u9101046@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. jgchung@mail.cmu.edu.tw u9101046@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Triterpenes)', 'E233J88OHQ (maslinic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Triterpenes/*administration & dosage']",PMC6364079,,2018/12/28 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['33/1/65 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11440 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2019 Jan-Feb;33(1):65-73. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11440.,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Maslinic acid', 'immune responses', 'leukemia WEHI-3 cells', 'macrophage', 'natural killer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve our understanding of factors that contribute to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activation and identify novel therapeutic targets, we searched for unique interactors of mTOR complexes through proteomics analyses. We identify cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel binding partner of the mTOR complex scaffold protein, mLST8. Our studies demonstrate that CDK9 is present in distinct mTOR-like (CTOR) complexes in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the nucleus, CDK9 binds to RAPTOR and mLST8, forming CTORC1, to promote transcription of genes important for leukemogenesis. In the cytoplasm, CDK9 binds to RICTOR, SIN1, and mLST8, forming CTORC2, and controls messenger RNA (mRNA) translation through phosphorylation of LARP1 and rpS6. Pharmacological targeting of CTORC complexes results in suppression of growth of primitive human AML progenitors in vitro and elicits strong antileukemic responses in AML xenografts in vivo.","['Beauchamp, Elspeth M', 'Abedin, Sameem M', 'Radecki, Sara G', 'Fischietti, Mariafausta', 'Arslan, Ahmet Dirim', 'Blyth, Gavin T', 'Yang, Angela', 'Lantz, Connor', 'Nelson, Alissa', 'Goo, Young Ah', 'Akpan, Imo', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Thomas, Paul M', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Beauchamp EM', 'Abedin SM', 'Radecki SG', 'Fischietti M', 'Arslan AD', 'Blyth GT', 'Yang A', 'Lantz C', 'Nelson A', 'Goo YA', 'Akpan I', 'Eklund EA', 'Frankfurt O', 'Fish EN', 'Thomas PM', 'Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2887-4765'],"['Robert H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The demographics, diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, and overall survival time of 130 patients with isolated SF3B1 (n=48) or TET2 mutation (n=54), or double SF3B1/TET2 mutation (n=28) were compared by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Patients with double mutation were found to be significantly older than patients with isolated TET2 mutation. Patients with double mutation or isolated SF3B1 mutation were less likely to be diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia than patients with isolated TET2 mutation. Patients with myelodysplasia had a higher percentage of double or isolated SF3B1 mutation, while patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had a higher percentage of isolated TET2 mutation. Patients with double mutation more frequently had increased ring sideroblasts similarly to patients with isolated SF3B1 mutation. The percentage of patients with normal cytogenetics or good cytogenetic abnormalities was significantly higher in patients with double mutation than those with isolated mutation. Finally, in patients with myelodysplasia and normal cytogenetics, the median survival time in those with double mutation was significantly longer than in those with isolated SF3B1 mutation, even though the overall survival curve was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: TET2 mutation appeared not to have additional effects when combined with SF3B1, and patients with double mutation appeared to have at least as, good as or even better prognosis than patients with isolated mutation.","['Song, Jinming', 'Moscinski, Lynn', 'Zhang, Hailing', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Hussaini, Mohammad']","['Song J', 'Moscinski L', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang X', 'Hussaini M']",,"['Department of Hematopathology and Lab Medicine, H.

This study investigated the function and the underlying mechanism of LINC00319 in AML progression. Firstly, the low expression level of LINC00319 in whole blood of healthy individuals was obtained from UCSC, and its upregulation was detected in AML patients as well as AML cell lines. Besides, the prognostic significance of LINC00319 was revealed in AML patients. Functionally, the loss-of-function assays revealed that LINC00319 silence restrained proliferation but stimulated apoptosis in AML cells. Furthermore, LINC00319 expression was demonstrated proportional to MYC level in AML samples and transcriptionally regulated by MYC. Mechanistically, we identified FUS as a shared RNA binding protein (RBP) interacting with both LINC00319 and SIRT6. And LINC00319 regulated SIRT6 expression at post-transcriptional level through FUS-dependent pathway. Last but not least, SIRT6 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of LINC00319 knockdown on AML cells growth. Overall, our findings unveiled that LINC00319 contributed to AML leukemogenesis via elevating SIRT6 expression, indicating a possible molecular target of LINC00319 for AML treatment.","['Zhang, Yanni', 'Huang, Zongxuan', 'Sheng, Fen', 'Yin, Zhaoyang']","['Zhang Y', 'Huang Z', 'Sheng F', 'Yin Z']",,"['Department of Neonatal Department, Ankang Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Ankang, Shaanxi, 725000, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of JiNing Medical Universrty, Jining, Shandong, 272029, China.', ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, First People's Hospital of Jining City, Shandong Province, Jining, Shandong, 272000, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Central Hospital of Shangluo City, Shanxi province, 726000, China.

In 2017, the BFORE trial demonstrated efficacy of bosutinib as first-line treatment in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). The most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade in bosutinib-treated patients in BFORE were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and increased aspartate aminotransferase, consistent with the most commonly reported AEs in earlier studies. To balance the efficacy and tolerability of treatment to optimize patient adherence with medications, treating physicians commonly use various strategies such as initiating treatment at a lower dose, dose reduction, or dose interruption, depending on the type and severity of the AEs and the clinical setting. In light of the recent data from first-line treatment, an expert panel of hematologists reviewed management strategies for the use of bosutinib in treatment of CP-CML and made the recommendations reported here. Although the panel focused on first-line treatment, the principles can be for the most part extended to bosutinib use in later lines of treatment. Recommendations include advice regarding prophylaxis and management for diarrhea. The panel also considered optimum timing for referral to a specialist for specific AEs. Across the commonly occurring AEs, the panel highlighted the importance of education and communication with patients about anticipated AEs.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Kota, Vamsi K', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Cortes JE', 'Apperley JF', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Deininger MW', 'Kota VK', 'Rousselot P', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8636-1071'],"['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org.', 'Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Versailles University, Versailles, France.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitriles/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*adverse effects/pharmacology']",PMC6307238,,2018/12/28 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0685-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0685-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Dec 27;11(1):143. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0685-2.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adverse events', '*Bosutinib', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Dosing strategies', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,20181227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib is commonly used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Previous clinical studies in melanoma returned inconclusive results and suggested that patients respond highly heterogeneously to dasatinib as single agent or in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic dacarbazine. Reliable biomarkers to predict dasatinib responsiveness in melanoma have not yet been developed. RESULTS: Here, we collected comprehensive in vitro data from experimentally well-controlled conditions to study the effect of dasatinib, alone and in combination with dacarbazine, on cell proliferation and cell survival. Sixteen treatment conditions, covering therapeutically relevant concentrations ranges of both drugs, were tested in 12 melanoma cell lines with diverse mutational backgrounds. Melanoma cell lines responded heterogeneously and, importantly, dasatinib and dacarbazine did not synergize in suppressing proliferation or inducing cell death. Since dasatinib is a promiscuous kinase inhibitor, possibly affecting multiple disease-relevant pathways, we also determined if basal phospho-protein amounts and treatment-induced changes in phospho-protein levels are indicative of dasatinib responsiveness. We found that treatment-induced de-phosphorylation of p53 correlates with dasatinib responsiveness in malignant melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of p53 phosphorylation might be an interesting candidate for a kinetic marker of dasatinib responsiveness in melanoma, pending more comprehensive validation in future studies.","['Skoko, Josip', 'Rozanc, Jan', 'Charles, Emilie M', 'Alexopoulos, Leonidas G', 'Rehm, Markus']","['Skoko J', 'Rozanc J', 'Charles EM', 'Alexopoulos LG', 'Rehm M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6149-9261'],"['Department of Physiology & Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology, University of Stuttgart, Allmandring 31, 70569, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'ProtATonce Ltd, Science Park Demokritos, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Physiology & Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'ProtATonce Ltd, Science Park Demokritos, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Physiology & Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland. markus.morrison@izi.uni-stuttgart.de.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland. markus.morrison@izi.uni-stuttgart.de.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology, University of Stuttgart, Allmandring 31, 70569, Stuttgart, Germany. markus.morrison@izi.uni-stuttgart.de.', 'Stuttgart Research Center Systems Biology, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany. markus.morrison@izi.uni-stuttgart.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/pharmacology', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC6307246,,2018/12/28 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2018/12/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12860-018-0180-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12860-018-0180-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2018 Dec 27;19(1):28. doi: 10.1186/s12860-018-0180-1.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell death', '*Dacarbazine', '*Dasatinib', '*Melanoma', '*Proliferation']",,,20181227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regional variation in spending for similar patients is often interpreted as evidence that resources can be saved, because higher-spending regions could achieve savings by behaving more like their lower-spending counterparts. STUDY DESIGN: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare data from 2006-2013 for this retrospective observational cohort study. Analysis focused on patients with non-small cell lung cancer, advanced (stage III or IV) breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Episodes were identified for patients with the 5 included cancers, following the episode definition used in the OCM. We estimated standardized episode-level spending for a standard patient across subcategories of care for each hospital referral region (HRR) defined by the Dartmouth Atlas. The contribution of each subcategory to interregional variation in total spending reflects that subcategory's potential to yield savings. RESULTS: Chemotherapy and acute inpatient hospital care tended to be the highest contributors to interregional variation. Imaging, nonchemotherapy Part B drugs, physician evaluation and management services, and diagnostics were negligible contributors to interregional variation for all 5 cancers.

The commentary provides a critical review of low-dose or low dose-rate studies, most published within the last 10 y, that are applicable to current occupational, environmental, and medical radiation exposures. The strengths and weaknesses of the epidemiologic methods, dosimetry assessments, and statistical modeling of 29 epidemiologic studies of total solid cancer, leukemia, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer, as well as heritable effects and a few nonmalignant conditions, were evaluated. An appraisal of the degree to which the low-dose or low dose-rate studies supported a linear no-threshold model for radiation protection or on the contrary, demonstrated sufficient evidence that the linear no-threshold model is inappropriate for the purposes of radiation protection was also included. The review found that many, though not all, studies of solid cancer supported the continued use of the linear no-threshold model in radiation protection. Evaluations of the principal studies of leukemia and low-dose or low dose-rate radiation exposure also lent support for the linear no-threshold model as used in protection. Ischemic heart disease, a major type of cardiovascular disease, was examined briefly, but the results of recent studies were considered too weak or inconsistent to allow firm conclusions regarding support of the linear no-threshold model. It is acknowledged that the possible risks from very low doses of low linear-energy-transfer radiation are small and uncertain and that it may never be possible to prove or disprove the validity of the linear no-threshold assumption by epidemiologic means. Nonetheless, the preponderance of recent epidemiologic data on solid cancer is supportive of the continued use of the linear no-threshold model for the purposes of radiation protection. This conclusion is in accord with judgments by other national and international scientific committees, based on somewhat older data. Currently, no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection purposes than the linear no-threshold model.","['Shore, Roy E', 'Beck, Harold L', 'Boice, John D Jr', 'Caffrey, Emily A', 'Davis, Scott', 'Grogan, Helen A', 'Mettler, Fred A Jr', 'Preston, R Julian', 'Till, John E', 'Wakeford, Richard', 'Walsh, Linda', 'Dauer, Lawrence T']","['Shore RE', 'Beck HL', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Caffrey EA', 'Davis S', 'Grogan HA', 'Mettler FA Jr', 'Preston RJ', 'Till JE', 'Wakeford R', 'Walsh L', 'Dauer LT']",,"['New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, and Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan (retired).', 'US Department of Energy (retired), New York, NY.', 'National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD, and Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Radian Scientific, Huntsville, AL.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Cascade Scientific, Bend, OR.', 'University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM.', 'US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC.', 'Risk Assessment Corporation, Neeses, SC.', 'University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', '*Radiation Protection/methods/standards', 'Radiometry/standards']",,,2018/12/27 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000001015 [doi]', '00004032-201902000-00023 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2019 Feb;116(2):235-246. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000001015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, the recent exciting description of age-related clonal hematopoiesis and its evolution to AML may open new avenues for intervention prior to development of full-blown leukemia.

This care approach is costly and may further contribute to the reduced qualify of life of these patients. This has raised interest in moving at least part of this care to the outpatient setting. Reimbursement challenges for inpatient administration of some of the new drugs approved for AML in the last 2 years adds to this interest. RECENT FINDINGS: Retrospective and smaller prospective studies have shown that outpatient management following intensive induction chemotherapy ('Early Hospital Discharge') is feasible and may be well tolerated and cost-effective. Reported experience is more limited regarding administration of intensive chemotherapy in the outpatient setting. SUMMARY: Although of interest, barriers to the successful implementation of outpatient care models, such as limited outpatient infrastructure or geographical limitations, will have to be overcome in many cancer centers. Importantly, before wide-spread introduction, the safety and 'efficacy' (e.g. reduction in medical resources and/or cost and improvement in quality of life) of outpatient care strategies will need to be further evaluated in a prospective - and ideally randomized - manner across more heterogeneous types of oncology and geographical settings.","['Halpern, Anna B', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Halpern AB', 'Walter RB', 'Estey EH']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Ambulatory Care', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life']",,,2018/12/27 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000481 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):65-70. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) reduces the risk of disease recurrence, and thus the advent of reduced intensity-conditioning regimens coupled with increased donor availability has increased the deliverability of potentially curative transplant therapy in AML. However, allo-SCT remains associated with significant additional morbidity and mortality, and it is therefore important to identify patients whose outcome if treated with chemotherapy alone is good enough to spare them the risks associated with allo-SCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Characterization of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities present at diagnosis coupled with dynamic assessments of measurable residual disease now permit greater accuracy in defining the relapse risk in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. At the same time, the risk of transplant-related mortality can be predicted by a number of scoring systems which assess patient comorbidity. Taken together, such assessments permit a dynamic assessment of the risks and benefits of transplantation aiding the identification of patients who are unlikely to benefit from transplantation in CR1. SUMMARY: Increasingly accurate risk stratification in adults with AML CR1 aids the rational utilization of allo-SCT. Future research integrating the results of serial MRD analysis in molecularly defined subtypes of AML will further improve rational selection of patients for transplant.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Raghavan, Manoj']","['Craddock C', 'Raghavan M']",,"['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, USA.']",['eng'],['CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (CR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/*metabolism', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,,2018/12/27 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000482 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):58-64. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000482.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-HCT MRD has allowed prognostication of HCT outcomes for high-risk leukemia patients, whereas the detection of post-HCT MRD has allowed for interventions to decrease relapse. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we emphasize studies from the past two decades that highlight the critical role of MRD in HCT in pediatric ALL and AML. Advances in MRD detection methodology, using next-generation sequencing, have improved the sensitivity of MRD testing allowing for more accurate predictions of HCT outcomes for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL and AML. In addition, novel pre-HCT therapies, especially immunotherapy in ALL, have dramatically increased the number of patients who achieve MRD-negative remissions pre-HCT, resulting in improved HCT outcomes. Post-HCT MRD remains a challenge and new therapeutic interventions are needed to reduce post-HCT relapse. SUMMARY: As immunotherapy increases pre-HCT MRD-negative remissions, and next-generation sequencing-MRD is incorporated to improve the sensitivity of MRD detection, future clinical studies will investigate less toxic HCT approaches to reduce long-term sequelae and to identify which patients may benefit most from early post-HCT intervention to reduce relapse.","['Taraseviciute, Agne', 'Pulsipher, Michael A']","['Taraseviciute A', 'Pulsipher MA']",,"[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA181050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 HL069254/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,IM,"['Child', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual']",PMC7461816,['NIHMS1621915'],2018/12/27 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000729 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2019 Feb;31(1):3-13. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000729.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we explored the feasibility of BCR-Abl siRNA therapy in CML K562 cells in vitro by employing a cationic polymer derived from cholesterol (Chol) grafted low-molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI). The first generation TKI imatinib upregulated the expression of BCR-Abl in K562 cells as expected. Delivery of BCR-Abl siRNA in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant K562 cells significantly downregulated the mRNA levels in both cell types. Similarly, the BCR-Abl siRNA treatment arrested the growth of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant K562 cells with no obvious differences despite a large difference in drug responsiveness. The BCR-Abl gene silencing in combination with TKI treatments exhibited significant synergism in drug-resistant K562 cells in generating substantial antileukemic activity, where the TKIs on their own were not effective. The effect of BCR-Abl siRNA and TKIs on non-CML cells (Jurkat and primary fibroblast) was negligible, indicating the specificity of the proposed therapy. This strategy can significantly overcome TKI resistance in CML cells, suggesting a feasible and effective treatment model for CML patients suffering from clinical resistances.","['Kc, Remant', 'Thapa, Bindu', 'Ubeda, Anyeld', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Kc R', 'Thapa B', 'Ubeda A', 'Jiang X', 'Uludag H']",,"['1 Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', '2 Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', '4 Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', '1 Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', '2 Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",,,2018/12/27 06:00,2020/05/01 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2018.0196 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Jun 1;28(11):734-744. doi: 10.1089/scd.2018.0196.

Given the consistently identified racial disparities in overall survival (OS) among patients with AML, we aimed to evaluate whether there were sustained on-therapy racial differences in inpatient mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, or supportive care beyond initial induction. PROCEDURE: Within a retrospective cohort of 1239 children diagnosed with AML between 2004 and 2014 in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database who survived their initial course of induction chemotherapy, we compared on-therapy inpatient mortality, ICU-level care requirements, treatment course duration, cumulative length of hospital stay (LOS), and resource utilization after induction I by race. RESULTS: Over the period from the start of induction II through completion of frontline chemotherapy, there were no significant differences in mortality (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.41-2.48), ICU-level care requirements (adjusted OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69-1.26), LOS (adjusted mean difference, 3.2 days; 95% CI, -2.3-9.6), or supportive care resource utilization for black patients relative to white patients. Course-specific analyses also demonstrated no differences by race. CONCLUSION: Although black patients have higher acuity at presentation and higher induction mortality, such disparities do not persist over subsequent frontline chemotherapy treatment. This finding allows interventions aimed at reducing disparities to be directed at presentation and induction.","['Li, Yimei', 'Newton, Joanna G', 'Getz, Kelly D', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Winestone, Lena E']","['Li Y', 'Newton JG', 'Getz KD', 'Huang YS', 'Seif AE', 'Fisher BT', 'Aplenc R', 'Winestone LE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1799-2582', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9982-1594']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Healthcare Analytics Unit, Department of General Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Allergy, Immunology & BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['K12CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD060550/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 HL143153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', ""Abramson Cancer Cener's Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical"", 'Oncology K12CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*African Americans', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Critical Care', '*Databases, Factual', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/ethnology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', '*Whites']",PMC6386601,['NIHMS1000756'],2018/12/27 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27583 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Apr;66(4):e27583. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27583.

Its occurrence in childhood cancer survivors has not previously been investigated in detail. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the hospital registers of the five Nordic countries, 32,944 childhood cancer survivors and 212,675 population comparisons were followed for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Hospitalisation rates, standardised hospitalisation rate ratios and absolute excess risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in 131 childhood cancer survivors, yielding an overall relative risk of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) compared with population comparisons. The risk was greatest 1-5 years after the diagnosis of cancer and in survivors of thyroid cancers, neuroblastomas, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphoma. Sixty-seven percent of survivors with hyperthyroidism had tumours located in the head, neck or upper body and half of survivors with hyperthyroidism were irradiated with 77% of them in the head and neck area. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors are at an increased risk of hyperthyroidism, potentially resulting in non-endocrine morbidity.","['Clausen, Camilla T', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Holmqvist, Anna S', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, Laura', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie']","['Clausen CT', 'Hasle H', 'Holmqvist AS', 'Madanat-Harjuoja L', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Wesenberg F', 'Bautz A', 'Winther JF', 'de Fine Licht S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3440-5108', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7855-4706']","['a Childhood Cancer Research Group , Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark.', 'b Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark.', 'c Department of Clinical Sciences , Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'd Paediatric Oncology and Haematology , Skane University Hospital , Lund , Sweden.', ""e Finnish Cancer Registry , Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital , Helsinki , Finland."", 'f Icelandic Cancer Registry, Faculty of Medicine , University of Iceland , Reykjavik , Iceland.', 'g Cancer Registry of Norway , Oslo , Norway.', 'h Department of Paediatric Medicine , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'i Faculty of Medicine , Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'a Childhood Cancer Research Group , Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark.', 'a Childhood Cancer Research Group , Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark.', 'j Faculty of Health, Department of Clinical Medicine , Aarhus University , Aarhus , Denmark.', 'a Childhood Cancer Research Group , Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Hyperthyroidism/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/27 06:00,2019/06/05 06:00,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2018.1535187 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2019 Feb;58(2):227-231. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1535187.

The genes L3MBTL1 and SGK2, also on chromosome 20, are in a cluster of imprinted genes, and their loss implies dysregulation of BM function. We report here the results of array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) performed on BM DNA of six patients which confirmed the consistent loss of EIF6 gene. Interestingly, array single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed copy neutral loss of heterozygosity for EIF6 region in cases without del(20)(q). No preferential parental origin of the deleted chromosome 20 was detected by microsatellite analysis in six SDS patients. Our patients showed a very mild haematological condition, and none evolved into BM aplasia or MDS/AML. We extend the benign prognostic significance of del(20)(q) and loss of EIF6 to the haematological features of these patients, consistently characterized by mild hypoplastic BM, no or mild neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia.

With an increasing number of second-generation sequencing data, transcriptomic modifications, so called RNA mutations, are emerging as significant forces that drive the transition from normal cell to malignant tumor, as well as providing tumor diversity to escape an immune attack. Editing of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is one dynamic modification that in a combinatorial manner can give rise to a very diverse transcriptome. Since the cell interprets inosine as guanosine (G), A-to-I editing can result in non-synonymous codon changes in transcripts as well as yield alternative splicing, but also affect targeting and disrupt maturation of microRNAs. ADAR-mediated RNA editing is essential for survival in mammals, however, its dysregulation causes aberrant editing of its targets that may lead to cancer. ADAR1 is commonly overexpressed, for instance in breast, lung, liver and esophageal cancer as well as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, where it promotes cancer progression. It is well known that ADAR1 regulates type I interferon (IFN) and its induced gene signature, which are known to operate as a significant barrier to tumor formation and progression. Adding to the complexity, ADAR1 expression is also regulated by IFN. In this review, we discussed the regulatory mechanisms of ADAR1 during tumorigenesis through aberrant editing of specific substrates. Additionally, we hypothesized that elevated ADAR1 levels play a role in suppressing an innate immunity response in cancer cells.","['Xu, Li-Di', 'Ohman, Marie']","['Xu LD', 'Ohman M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6636-5841'],"['Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Svante Arrhenius vag 20C, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. lidi.xu@su.se.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Svante Arrhenius vag 20C, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. marie.ohman@su.se.']",['eng'],['2015-05094 and K2013-66X-20702/Vetenskapsradet'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,,,,PMC6356570,,2018/12/27 06:00,2018/12/27 06:01,['2018/12/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/27 06:01 [medline]']","['genes10010012 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10010012 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2018 Dec 25;10(1). pii: genes10010012. doi: 10.3390/genes10010012.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADAR1', 'RNA editing', 'adenosine deamination', 'cancer', 'innate immunity']",,,20181225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The encoded Bcr-Abl fusion protein is responsible for the pathogenesis of certain human leukemias. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) is a retrovirus that could lead to transformation of B lymphocyte in mice, and v-Abl is the oncogene of A-MuLV. Abl oncoproteins (such as Bcr-Abl and v-Abl) play critical roles in tumorigenesis of certain cell types. Several signal transduction pathways, including JAK/STAT/Pim, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway, are involved in Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. In addition, Abl-mediated tumorigenesis is associated with mutation or abnormal modification of key signal molecules as well as dysregulation of some critical long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we review the molecular mechanisms by which Abl oncogenes activate three major signaling pathways, and provide a scientific basis for therapy of Abl oncoprotein-induced tumors.","['Sun, Yanan', 'Chen, Na', 'Wang, Xuefei', 'Chen, Ji-Long', 'Ma, Yanmei']","['Sun Y', 'Chen N', 'Wang X', 'Chen JL', 'Ma Y']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2018/12/26 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.13345/j.cjb.180183 [doi]'],ppublish,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2018 Dec 25;34(12):1943-1952. doi: 10.13345/j.cjb.180183.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['A-MuLV', 'Bcr-Abl', 'cancer', 'lncRNA', 'signalling pathway', 'tyrosine kinase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective multicentre study, we investigated the clinical courses of six ESKD patients that received KT after HSCT for various haematological diseases. Data for six such patients were obtained from three institutions in our consortium. RESULTS: Two patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, one with refractory aplastic anaemia and another one with acute lymphocytic leukaemia received bone marrow transplantation. One patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia received umbilical cord blood transplantation, and one with mantle cell lymphoma received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The patients developed ESKD at a median of 133 months after HSCT. Two patients who received KT and HSCT from the same donor were temporarily treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The other patients received KT and HSCT from different donors and were treated with antibody induction using our standard regimens. For one patient with ABO-incompatible transplantation, we added rituximab, splenectomy, and plasmapheresis. In the observational period at a median of 51 months after KT, only one patient experienced acute T-cell-mediated rejection. Four patients underwent hospitalization because of infection and fully recovered. No patient experienced recurrence of their original haematological disease. All patients survived throughout the observational periods, and graft functions were preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high infection frequency, survival rates and graft functions were extremely good in patients compared with previous studies. Therefore, current management contributed to favourable outcomes of these patients.","['Tsuchimoto, Akihiro', 'Masutani, Kosuke', 'Omoto, Kazuya', 'Okumi, Masayoshi', 'Okabe, Yasuhiro', 'Nishiki, Takehiro', 'Ota, Morihito', 'Nakano, Toshiaki', 'Tsuruya, Kazuhiko', 'Kitazono, Takanari', 'Nakamura, Masafumi', 'Ishida, Hideki', 'Tanabe, Kazunari']","['Tsuchimoto A', 'Masutani K', 'Omoto K', 'Okumi M', 'Okabe Y', 'Nishiki T', 'Ota M', 'Nakano T', 'Tsuruya K', 'Kitazono T', 'Nakamura M', 'Ishida H', 'Tanabe K']",,"['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', ""Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawata-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", ""Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawata-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", 'Department of Surgery and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Fukuoka Red Cross Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tomishiro Central Hospital, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', ""Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawata-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", ""Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawata-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan. tanabe@twmu.ac.jp.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",Japan,Clin Exp Nephrol,Clinical and experimental nephrology,9709923,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts/physiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infections/etiology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/12/26 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10157-018-1672-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10157-018-1672-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Nephrol. 2019 Apr;23(4):561-568. doi: 10.1007/s10157-018-1672-1.

It has been considered the subgroup of ALL with the worst outcome. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) allows complete hematologic remission virtually in all patients, with improved disease-free survival and overall survival. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistant mutations in BCR-ABL1 may require different TKI strategies to overcome the patient's resistance and disease relapse. Here, we report a Ph+B-ALL case with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment with dasatinib. The patient expressed the P190(BCR-ABL1) isoform and a novel BCR-ABL1 mutation, p.Y440C. The latter is in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, which likely induces deviations in the protein structure and activity and destabilizes its inactive conformation. The treatment was substituted by bosutinib, which binds to the active conformation of the protein, prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplant to overcome the lack of a complete response to dasatinib. These findings strengthen the importance of BCR-ABL1 mutational screening in Ph+ patients, particularly for those who do not achieve complete molecular remission.","['Vinhas, Raquel', 'Lourenco, Alexandra', 'Santos, Susana', 'Lemos, Marcos', 'Ribeiro, Patricia', 'de Sousa, Aida Botelho', 'Baptista, Pedro Viana', 'Fernandes, Alexandra Ramos']","['Vinhas R', 'Lourenco A', 'Santos S', 'Lemos M', 'Ribeiro P', 'de Sousa AB', 'Baptista PV', 'Fernandes AR']",,"['UCIBIO, Life Sciences Department, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal, ma.fernandes@fct.unl.pt; pmvb@fct.unl.pt.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital dos Capuchos (CHLC), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital dos Capuchos (CHLC), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital dos Capuchos (CHLC), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital dos Capuchos (CHLC), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital dos Capuchos (CHLC), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'UCIBIO, Life Sciences Department, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal, ma.fernandes@fct.unl.pt; pmvb@fct.unl.pt.', 'UCIBIO, Life Sciences Department, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal, ma.fernandes@fct.unl.pt; pmvb@fct.unl.pt.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6280987,,2018/12/26 06:00,2018/12/26 06:01,['2018/12/26 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S177019 [doi]', 'ott-11-8589 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Nov 30;11:8589-8598. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S177019. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'e14a2', 'mutation', 'p.Y440C']",,,20181130,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor widely used to treat MDS and AML, yet the impact of AZA on the cell-surface proteome has not been defined. To identify potential therapeutic targets for use in combination with AZA in AML patients, we investigated the effects of AZA treatment on four AML cell lines representing different stages of differentiation. The effect of AZA treatment on these cell lines was characterized at three levels: the DNA methylome, the transcriptome, and the cell-surface proteome. Untreated AML cell lines showed substantial overlap at all three omics levels; however, while AZA treatment globally reduced DNA methylation in all cell lines, changes in the transcriptome and surface proteome were subtle and differed among the cell lines. Transcriptome analysis identified five commonly up-regulated coding genes upon AZA treatment in all four cell lines, TRPM4 being the only gene encoding a surface protein, and surface proteome analysis found no commonly regulated proteins. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially regulated RNA and surface proteins showed a decrease in metabolic pathways and an increase in immune defense response pathways. As such, AZA treatment led to diverse effects at the individual gene and protein levels but converged to common responses at the pathway level. Given the heterogeneous responses in the four cell lines, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for AML in combination with AZA.","['Leung, Kevin K', 'Nguyen, Aaron', 'Shi, Tao', 'Tang, Lin', 'Ni, Xiaochun', 'Escoubet, Laure', 'MacBeth, Kyle J', 'DiMartino, Jorge', 'Wells, James A']","['Leung KK', 'Nguyen A', 'Shi T', 'Tang L', 'Ni X', 'Escoubet L', 'MacBeth KJ', 'DiMartino J', 'Wells JA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2087-4974', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8267-5519']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Epigenetics Thematic Center of Excellence, Celgene Corporation, San Francisco, CA 94158.', 'Department of Informatics and Predictive Sciences, Celgene Corporation, San Diego, CA 92121.', 'Department of Informatics and Predictive Sciences, Celgene Corporation, San Diego, CA 92121.', 'Department of Informatics and Predictive Sciences, Celgene Corporation, Cambridge, MA 02140.', 'Department of Informatics and Predictive Sciences, Celgene Corporation, San Diego, CA 92121.', 'Epigenetics Thematic Center of Excellence, Celgene Corporation, San Francisco, CA 94158.', 'Epigenetics Thematic Center of Excellence, Celgene Corporation, San Francisco, CA 94158.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143; jim.wells@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['P41 CA196276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM122451/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'Canadian Institutes of Health Research/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genomics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proteome/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC6329958,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/12/26 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['1813666116 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1813666116 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Jan 8;116(2):695-700. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1813666116.

This study further investigated the effects of a combination treatment of STF and doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro and in vivo. The combination treatment of 50 mg/kg of STF strongly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of DOX in SCID-beige mice bearing K562/Adr xenografts without additional toxicity when compared to the single treatment groups. Additionally, an examination of the proliferation markers (Ki67) and the apoptotic marker (TUNEL) in tumor tissues in each group revealed that the combination therapy significantly reduced Ki67 positive cells and increased apoptotic cells. From the in vitro experiments we also found that this combination treatment dramatically induced G1 and G2M arrest in K562/Adr when compared to a single treatment of DOX. STF treatment alone did not show any cytotoxic effect to the cells. These results suggest that the accumulation of DOX enhanced by STF was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest in K562/Adr. These findings support our previous in vitro data and indicate the possibility of developing STF as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatments.","['Umsumarng, Sonthaya', 'Mapoung, Sariya', 'Yodkeeree, Supachai', 'Pyne, Stephen G', 'Limtrakul Dejkriengkraikul, Pornngarm']","['Umsumarng S', 'Mapoung S', 'Yodkeeree S', 'Pyne SG', 'Limtrakul Dejkriengkraikul P']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Excellent Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

However, incorporating next generation sequencing (NGS) of hematologic malignancies into clinical management remains limited. Methods: We describe 235 patients who underwent integrated NGS profiling (406 genes) and analyze the alterations and their potential actionability. Results: Overall, 227 patients (96.5%) had adequate tissue. Most common diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (22.9%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (17.2%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.2%), acute myeloid leukemia (11%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (9.2%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8.8%), and multiple myeloma (7.5%). Most patients (N = 197/227 (87%)) harbored >/=1 genomic alteration(s); 170/227 (75%), >/=1 potentially actionable alteration(s) targetable by an FDA-approved (mostly off-label) or an investigational agent. Altogether, 546 distinct alterations were seen, most commonly involving TP53 (10.8%), TET2 (4.6%), and DNMT3A (4.2%). The median tumor mutational burden (TMB) was low (1.7 alterations/megabase); 12% of patients had intermediate or high TMB (higher TMB correlates with favorable response to anti-PD1/PDL1 inhibition in solid tumors). In conclusion, 96.5% of patients with hematologic malignancies have adequate tissue for comprehensive genomic profiling. Most patients had unique molecular signatures, and 75% had alterations that may be pharmacologically tractable with gene- or immune-targeted agents.","['Galanina, Natalie', 'Bejar, Rafael', 'Choi, Michael', 'Goodman, Aaron', 'Wieduwilt, Matthew', 'Mulroney, Carolyn', 'Kim, Lisa', 'Yeerna, Huwate', 'Tamayo, Pablo', 'Vergilio, Jo-Anne', 'Mughal, Tariq I', 'Miller, Vincent', 'Jamieson, Catriona', 'Kurzrock, Razelle']","['Galanina N', 'Bejar R', 'Choi M', 'Goodman A', 'Wieduwilt M', 'Mulroney C', 'Kim L', 'Yeerna H', 'Tamayo P', 'Vergilio JA', 'Mughal TI', 'Miller V', 'Jamieson C', 'Kurzrock R']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8858-3260', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9360-4668']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. ngalanina@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. rabejar@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. mychoi@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. a1goodman@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. a1goodman@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. mwieduwilt@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. mwieduwilt@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. camulroney@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. camulroney@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. lit003@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Statistical Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. hyeerna@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Statistical Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. ptamayo@ucsd.edu.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA 02141, USA. jvergilio@foundationmedicine.com.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA 02141, USA. tmughal@foundationmedicine.com.', 'Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA. tmughal@foundationmedicine.com.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA 02141, USA. vmiller@foundationmedicine.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. cjamieson@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Science Drive #0987, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. rkurzrock@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['U24 CA248457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA194107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG009285/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6356731,,2018/12/26 06:00,2018/12/26 06:01,['2018/12/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11010011 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11010011 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 Dec 21;11(1). pii: cancers11010011. doi: 10.3390/cancers11010011.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['lymphoid malignancies', 'myeloid malignancies', 'next generation sequencing', 'precision medicine']",,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been shown that assessment of CD200 expression may improve the distinction between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; CD200 positive) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; CD200 negative), but any potential as a prognostic marker for CLL remains to be established. Materials and methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on sixty-seven patients newly diagnosed as having mature B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders Levels of CD 200 in lymphoma cells were assessed. Results: CD200 was consistently expressed in CLL and hairy cell leukemia B cells, but not in MCL cells. Heterogeneous expression was noted in other CD5 positive Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. High CD200 expression (>/=50%) was associated with a higher CD5, 19 and CD23 expression, older age, higher TLC and absolute lymphocyte count, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and a higher Rai stage. There were no significant correlations between CD200 expression and response to treatment. Conclusion: CD200 could be of high value in distinguishing CLL, MCL, and atypical CLL. CD200 expression can also be of prognostic and therapeutic value in CLL cases.","['El Din Fouad, Neveen Bahaa', 'Ibrahim, Noha Yehia', 'Abdel Aziz, Rania Salah', 'Ibrahim, Sarah Khalid']","['El Din Fouad NB', 'Ibrahim NY', 'Abdel Aziz RS', 'Ibrahim SK']",,"['Clinical Pathology Department, Faulty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.

Discovery of Imatinib Mesylate (IM) as first line therapy has brought tremendous improvement in the management of CML. However, emergence of point mutations within the BCR-ABL gene particularly T315I mutation, affects a common BCR-ABL kinase contact residue which impairs drug binding thus contribute to treatment resistance. This study aims to investigate the BCR-ABL T315I mutation in Malaysian patients with CML. Methods: A total of 285 patients diagnosed with CML were included in this study. Mutation detection was performed using qualitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results: Fifteen out of 285 samples (5.26%) were positive for T315I mutations after amplification with real-time PCR assay. From the total number of positive samples, six patients were in accelerated phase (AP), four in chronic phase (CP) and five in blast crisis (BC). Conclusion: Mutation testing is recommended for choosing various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to optimize outcomes for both cases of treatment failure or suboptimal response to imatinib. Therefore, detection of T315I mutation in CML patients are clinically useful in the selection of appropriate treatment strategies to prevent disease progression.","['Mat Yusoff, Yuslina', 'Abu Seman, Zahidah', 'Othman, Norodiyah', 'Kamaluddin, Nor Rizan', 'Esa, Ezalia', 'Zulkiply, Nor Amalina', 'Abdullah, Julia', 'Zakaria, Zubaidah']","['Mat Yusoff Y', 'Abu Seman Z', 'Othman N', 'Kamaluddin NR', 'Esa E', 'Zulkiply NA', 'Abdullah J', 'Zakaria Z']",,"['Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

METHODS: Mutations of TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 genes were studied by direct sequencing in the main group of 106 CLLpatients exposed to IR due to Chornobyl NPP accident and in the control group of 130 IR non-exposed CLL patients. RESULTS: We found TP53 and SF3B1 mutations with similar incidence in both groups - 11.3 % and 10.0 % in the maingroup, and 12.7 % and 11.5 % in the control group, respectively. In contrast, the frequency of NOTCH1 mutationswas lower in IR-exposed patients (6.7 % vs 17.7 %; p = 0.012). TP53 mutations were seen with equal frequency amongmutated (11.1 %) and unmutated (11.8 %) immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV) cases in IR-exposedCLL patients, while the tendency to prevalence of TP53 mutations in unmutated compared with mutated IGHV caseswas found in the control group (14.1 % and 5.6 %, correspondingly; p = 0.178). In IR-exposed group SF3B1 muta-tions were combined with mutations in TP53 almost in half of detected cases. In opposite, in the control group therewas mutual exclusivity between SF3B1 and TP53 lesions (p = 0.001). Among IR-exposed CLL patients we found two dif-ferent cases with identical rare mutation of TP53 gene - c.665C>T substitution (Pro222Leu). This substitution is verylikely to represent inherited TP53 mutation, which may influence CLL development under IR exposure. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that TP53 abnormalities are involved in CLL development in subjectsexposed at the Chornobyl accident and also a possible connection between inherited sensitivity to ionizing radia-tion caused by mutation in TP53, radiation and CLL development.","['Bilous, N I', 'Abramenko, I V', 'Chumak, A A', 'Dyagil, I S', 'Martina, Z V', 'Saenko, V', 'Bazyka, D A']","['Bilous NI', 'Abramenko IV', 'Chumak AA', 'Dyagil IS', 'Martina ZV', 'Saenko V', 'Bazyka DA']",,"['State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'Department of Radiation Molecular Epidemiology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.']","['eng', 'ukr']",,['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Survivors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Ukraine']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33145/2304-8336-2018-23-283-301 [doi]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2018 Dec;23:283-301. doi: 10.33145/2304-8336-2018-23-283-301.,"['N.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Examined 74 children with acute leukemia (capital A, CyrillicL): 64 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL); 10 - acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The influence of negative environmental factors was assessed bythe degree of integrated pollution of the atmospheric air, surface waters and soils with pesticides, heavy metals (Pb,Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn, Zn, Fe) and cesium isotope 137Cs. These regions were ranked on a moderately polluted (1), polluted (2),very (3) and extremely (4) polluted territories. Took into account the age of children, blood test, immunophenotyp-ic of variant the acute leukemia, survival of patients and place of residence (city / village), serum ferritin level (SF). RESULTS: Exposure doses of children were in the range from 0.4 mSv to 35.0 mSv (average values were (4.25 +/- 0.63 mSv)and did not affect the prognosis and variants of AL. 52 children lived in moderately and polluted territories (30 wereresidents of cities, 22 - villages). 22 patients were lived in very and extremely polluted territories (4 were residentsof cities, 18 - villages). Of 74 patients with ALL and AML 24 children died (32.4 %). The smallest number ofchildren, who died, were patients with <<general type>> capital VE, Cyrillic-ALL (18.7 %), most of all children with pro-capital VE, Cyrillic-ALL (8 out of10) and capital TE, Cyrillic-ALL (3 of 4). Of the 52 patients, the inhabitants of moderately and polluted regions, 13 patients died (25%), while out of 22 patients, who lived in very and extremely polluted areas, 11 children died (50 % share)(rs = 0.39; p < 0.05). Of the 10 patients with AML, 4 children died. Most often, children died, who were residents ofvillages. Moreover, the level of SF was significantly higher in children over 6 years, the inhabitants of villages -(406.8 +/- 40.6) ng/ml, compared to younger patients - (211.2 +/- 32.1) ng/ml) and residents of of cities: up to 6years - (297.4 +/- 52.3) ng/ml; over 6 years - (275.6 +/- 29.8) ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data testify to the negative influence of environmental factors, including iron, and canbe the basis for understanding the mechanisms of potentiating influence of metals and their compounds on thedevelopment of malignant diseases of the blood system in children.","['Bebeshko, V G', 'Bruslova, K M', 'Tsvietkova, N M', 'Lyashenko, L O', 'Pushkareva, T I', 'Honchar, L O', 'Sergeeva, A S', 'Yatsemyrskii, M', 'Samson, Y M', 'Trihlib, I V', 'Makovey, O I']","['Bebeshko VG', 'Bruslova KM', 'Tsvietkova NM', 'Lyashenko LO', 'Pushkareva TI', 'Honchar LO', 'Sergeeva AS', 'Yatsemyrskii M', 'Samson YM', 'Trihlib IV', 'Makovey OI']",,"['State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'State Institution <<National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine>>, 53 Melnykova str., Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.']","['eng', 'ukr']",,['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Metals, Heavy)', '0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/analysis', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Metals, Heavy/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Pesticides/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Rural Population', 'Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology', 'Urban Population', 'Water Pollution, Radioactive/analysis']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33145/2304-8336-2018-23-254-262 [doi]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2018 Dec;23:254-262. doi: 10.33145/2304-8336-2018-23-254-262.,"['V.

Most C-type lectins are glycan-binding proteins, some of which are pivotal for innate immune responses against pathogens. Other C-type lectins, such as the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), have been shown to induce immunosuppressive responses upon the recognition of aberrant glycosylation on cancer cells. MGL is known to recognize terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), such as the Tn antigen, which is commonly found on malignant cells. Even though this glycan specificity of MGL is well described, there is a lack of understanding of the actual glycoproteins that bind MGL. We present a glycoproteomic workflow for the identification of MGL-binding proteins, which we applied to study MGL ligands on the human Jurkat leukemia cell line. In addition to the known MGL ligands and Tn antigen-carrying proteins CD43 and CD45 on these cells, we have identified a set of novel cell-surface ligands for MGL. Importantly, for several of these, O-glycosylation has hitherto not been described. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the identification and structure of novel MGL ligands that presumably act as modulatory molecules in cancer immune responses.","['Pirro, Martina', 'Schoof, Esmee', 'van Vliet, Sandra J', 'Rombouts, Yoann', 'Stella, Alexandre', 'de Ru, Arnoud', 'Mohammed, Yassene', 'Wuhrer, Manfred', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Hensbergen, Paul J']","['Pirro M', 'Schoof E', 'van Vliet SJ', 'Rombouts Y', 'Stella A', 'de Ru A', 'Mohammed Y', 'Wuhrer M', 'van Veelen PA', 'Hensbergen PJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9562-2395', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1811-2687', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4482-2199', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3265-3332', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0814-4995', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3193-5445']","['Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Dept. of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, 1007 MB Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale , Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS , Toulouse 31062 , France.', 'Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale , Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS , Toulouse 31062 , France.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics , Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 RC Leiden , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MGL lectin, human)', '0 (Tn antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'KM15WK8O5T (Acetylgalactosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylgalactosamine/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics', 'Leukosialin/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",PMC6399673,,2018/12/26 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00796 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2019 Mar 1;18(3):1125-1132. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00796.

The majority of CLL patients show an indolent course of the disease as well as an anergic phenotype of their leukemia cells, referring to a B cell receptor unresponsive to external stimulation. We have recently shown that the transcription factor NFAT2 is a crucial regulator of anergy in CLL. A major challenge in the analysis of the role of a transcription factor in different diseases is the identification of its specific target genes. This is of great significance for the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a classic technique to demonstrate protein-DNA interactions and can, therefore, be used to identify direct target genes of transcription factors in mammalian cells. Here, ChIP was used to identify LCK as a direct target gene of NFAT2 in human CLL cells. DNA and associated proteins are crosslinked using formaldehyde and subsequently sheared by sonication into DNA fragments of approximately 200-500 base pairs (bp). Cross-linked DNA fragments associated with NFAT2 are then selectively immunoprecipitated from cell debris using an alphaNFAT2 antibody. After purification, associated DNA fragments are detected via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). DNA sequences with evident enrichment represent regions of the genome which are targeted by NFAT2 in vivo. Appropriate shearing of the DNA and the selection of the required antibody are particularly crucial for the successful application of this method. This protocol is ideal for the demonstration of direct interactions of NFAT2 with target genes. Its major limitation is the difficulty to employ ChIP in large-scale assays analyzing the target genes of multiple transcription factors in intact organisms.","['Fuchs, Alexander R', 'Marklin, Melanie', 'Heitmann, Jonas S', 'Futterknecht, Stefan', 'Haap, Michael', 'Wirths, Stefan', 'Kopp, Hans-Georg', 'Hinterleitner, Clemens', 'Dorfel, Daniela', 'Muller, Martin R']","['Fuchs AR', 'Marklin M', 'Heitmann JS', 'Futterknecht S', 'Haap M', 'Wirths S', 'Kopp HG', 'Hinterleitner C', 'Dorfel D', 'Muller MR']",,"['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Endocrinology, Diabetology, Clinical Pathology and Metabolism, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen; martin.mueller@med.uni-tuebingen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)']",,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/58270 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2018 Dec 4;(142). doi: 10.3791/58270.,,,,,,,,20181204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thoracic CT scans of 49 ATL patients were retrospectively reviewed. On CT scans, the presence of lung parenchymal abnormalities (10 patterns), enlarged lymph nodes, pleural and pericardial effusions, and subcutaneous nodules was evaluated by two radiologists in cooperation. According to the Shimoyama criteria, the patients were divided into aggressive ATL group (n=28, acute and lymphoma types) and indolent ATL group (n=21, chronic and smoldering types). Differences in the prevalence of the CT findings between the two groups were examined. In the indolent ATL group, CT scans of 10 patients who eventually underwent transformation to aggressive ATL were also evaluated. RESULTS: In aggressive ATL, enlarged lymph nodes (68%) was the most frequently observed finding. Several patterns of lung abnormalities were observed, such as ground-glass attenuation (36%), bronchial wall thickening (32%), nodules (29%), and centrilobular opacities (29%). In indolent ATL, enlarged lymph nodules (24%) and bronchiectasis (24%) were relatively frequently detected. Overall, the incidence of abnormal findings was higher in aggressive than in indolent ATL, except for bronchiectasis. Patients with transformation to aggressive ATL frequently demonstrated enlarged lymph nodes (80%). CONCLUSION: On thoracic CT, enlarged lymph nodes and various lung and airway abnormalities, such as ground-glass attenuation and bronchial wall thickening, were observed in ATL patients, particularly those with aggressive ATL. Bronchiectasis was similarly found in patients with indolent ATL and aggressive ATL.","['Yogi, Satoko', 'Yamashiro, Tsuneo', 'Kamiya, Hisashi', 'Kamiya, Ayano', 'Miyara, Tetsuhiro', 'Moromizato, Hidekazu', 'Murayama, Sadayuki']","['Yogi S', 'Yamashiro T', 'Kamiya H', 'Kamiya A', 'Miyara T', 'Moromizato H', 'Murayama S']",,"['Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Nakagami Hospital, Okinawa City, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Nakagami Hospital, Okinawa City, Okinawa, Japan; Department of Radiology, Okinawa Red Cross Hospital, Naha, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Nakagami Hospital, Okinawa City, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Diagn Interv Radiol,"Diagnostic and interventional radiology (Ankara, Turkey)",101241152,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bronchiectasis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardial Effusion/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Radiologists', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thorax/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",PMC6339626,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5152/dir.2018.18038 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Interv Radiol. 2019 Jan;25(1):55-61. doi: 10.5152/dir.2018.18038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers from University of Illinois at Chicago and Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital (HAH) in Havana collaborated on retrospectively analyzing 101 consecutive patients with adult acute leukemia who received BMT at HAH from June 1986 to January 2016. Of these, 82 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 19 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BMT eligibility criteria included prior morphologic complete remission, no severe comorbidities, and age between 16 and 60 years. Patients with an HLA-matched donor received an allogeneic BMT, whereas the others received an autologous BMT. All patients received fresh stem cells from marrow (80%) or mobilized peripheral blood (19%). Of 82 patients with AML, 35 received an allogeneic (AML-allo) and 47 an autologous (AML-auto) BMT. Both groups had comparable median age (37 years) and follow-up of survivors. Overall survival (OS) was 34% in AML-allo and 38% in AML-auto. The transplant-related mortality rate was 40% in AML-allo and 17% in AML-auto, whereas the relapse-related mortality rates were 25% and 40%, respectively. Of the 19 patients with ALL, six received an allogeneic transplant. Of these, transplant-related mortality occurred in one patient and three died after disease relapse (OS, 33%). Of 13 patients who received autologous transplants, transplant-related mortality occurred in three and six died after disease relapse (OS, 31%). To our knowledge, this is the first scientific report on BMT performed in patients with acute leukemia in Cuba. The collaboration between University of Illinois at Chicago and HAH will further develop capacity building in research and implementation of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in Cuba.","['Carnot Uria, Jose', 'Hernandez Cruz, Calixto', 'Munio Perurena, Jorge', 'Torres Yribar, Wilfredo', 'Diego de la Campa, Jesus', 'Del Castillo Carrillo, Concepcion', 'Rodriguez Fraga, Yusaima', 'Lopez Silva, Julio A', 'Cepero Llauger, Kali', 'Pardo Ramirez, Ibis K', 'Garcia Garcia, Aliette', 'Sweiss, Karen', 'Patel, Pritesh R', 'Rondelli, Damiano']","['Carnot Uria J', 'Hernandez Cruz C', 'Munio Perurena J', 'Torres Yribar W', 'Diego de la Campa J', 'Del Castillo Carrillo C', 'Rodriguez Fraga Y', 'Lopez Silva JA', 'Cepero Llauger K', 'Pardo Ramirez IK', 'Garcia Garcia A', 'Sweiss K', 'Patel PR', 'Rondelli D']",,"['Jose Carnot Uria, Calixto Hernandez Cruz, Jorge Munio Perurena, Wilfredo Torres Yribar, Jesus Diego de la Campa, Concepcion del Castillo Carrillo, Yusaima Rodriguez Fraga, Julio A.

In this study, we followed the hypothesis that alternative splicing of DNMT3A has characteristic epigenetic and functional sequels. Specific DNMT3A transcripts were either down-regulated or overexpressed in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and this resulted in complementary and transcript-specific DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Functional analysis indicated that, particularly, transcript 2 (coding for DNMT3A2) activates proliferation and induces loss of a primitive immunophenotype, whereas transcript 4 interferes with colony formation of the erythroid lineage. Notably, in acute myeloid leukemia expression of transcript 2 correlates with its in vitro DNA methylation and gene expression signatures and is associated with overall survival, indicating that DNMT3A variants also affect malignancies. Our results demonstrate that specific DNMT3A variants have a distinct epigenetic and functional impact. Particularly, DNMT3A2 triggers hematopoietic differentiation and the corresponding signatures are reflected in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bozic, Tanja', 'Frobel, Joana', 'Raic, Annamarija', 'Ticconi, Fabio', 'Kuo, Chao-Chung', 'Heilmann-Heimbach, Stefanie', 'Goecke, Tamme W', 'Zenke, Martin', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Costa, Ivan G', 'Wagner, Wolfgang']","['Bozic T', 'Frobel J', 'Raic A', 'Ticconi F', 'Kuo CC', 'Heilmann-Heimbach S', 'Goecke TW', 'Zenke M', 'Jost E', 'Costa IG', 'Wagner W']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1107-3251', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-8697', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1971-3217']","['Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Department of Genomics, Life & Brain Center, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,,,,PMC6293073,,2018/12/26 06:00,2018/12/26 06:01,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.26508/lsa.201800153 [doi]', 'LSA-2018-00153 [pii]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2018 Dec 13;1(6):e201800153. doi: 10.26508/lsa.201800153. eCollection 2018 Dec.,,,,,,,,20181213,,"['RWTH Aachen Medical School has applied for a patent on the DNMT3A epimutation.

We hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 may reduce the likelihood of antigen loss, thus improving sustained remission rates. A systematic approach to the generation of CAR constructs incorporating two target-binding domains led to several novel CD19/CD22 bivalent CAR constructs. Importantly, we demonstrate the challenges associated with the construction of a bivalent CAR format that preserves bifunctionality against both CD19 and CD22. Using the most active bivalent CAR constructs, we found similar transduction efficiency compared to that of either CD19 or CD22 single CARs alone. When expressed on human T cells, the optimized CD19/CD22 CAR construct induced comparable interferon gamma and interleukin-2 in vitro compared to single CARs against dual-antigen-expressing as well as single-antigen-expressing cell lines. Finally, the T cells expressing CD19/CD22 CAR eradicated ALL cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), including a PDX generated from a patient with CD19(-) relapse following CD19-directed CAR therapy. The CD19/CD22 bivalent CAR provides an opportunity to test whether simultaneous targeting may reduce risk of antigen loss.","['Qin, Haiying', 'Ramakrishna, Sneha', 'Nguyen, Sang', 'Fountaine, Thomas J', 'Ponduri, Anusha', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Haso, Waleed', 'Shern, Jack F', 'Shah, Nirali N', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Qin H', 'Ramakrishna S', 'Nguyen S', 'Fountaine TJ', 'Ponduri A', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Yuan CM', 'Haso W', 'Shern JF', 'Shah NN', 'Fry TJ']",,"['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,PMC6300726,,2018/12/26 06:00,2018/12/26 06:01,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2018.10.006 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(18)30030-5 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2018 Nov 6;11:127-137. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2018.10.006. eCollection 2018 Dec 21.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adoptive cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'leukemia']",,,20181106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most lymphoblastic crises are of B-cell lineage. T-cell blast crisis is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. We present a case of a middle-aged man who was diagnosed with CML on peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy. Because of a generalized lymphadenopathy noted at the time of diagnosis, a lymph node biopsy was also performed, which revealed a T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, BCR/ABL1 positive, with clonal evolution. This is a very rare manifestation of CML in blast crisis with no standard treatment and with poor outcomes despite chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Given its rarity, it would be difficult to develop standard chemotherapy protocols. We believe the treatment for this condition should be similar to any lymphoid blast crisis.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind the action of sulforaphane in hematological malignancies are still unclear. Like other cancer cells, leukemia cells produce high level of reactive oxygen species; in particular, hydrogen peroxide derived from Nox family is involved in various redox signal transduction pathways, promoting cell proliferation and survival. Recent evidence show that many tumour cell types express elevated level of aquaporin isoforms, and we previously demonstrated that aquaporin-8 acts as H2O2 transport facilitator across the plasma membrane of B1647 cells, a model of acute myeloid human leukemia. Thus, the control of AQP8-mediated H2O2 transport could be a novel strategy to regulate cell signalling and survival. To this purpose, we evaluated whether sulforaphane could somehow affect aquaporin-8-mediated H2O2 transport and/or Nox-mediated H2O2 production in B1647 cell line. Results indicated that sulforaphane inhibited both aquaporin-8 and Nox2 expression, thus decreasing B1647 cells viability. Moreover, the data obtained by coimmunoprecipitation technique demonstrated that these two proteins are linked to each other; thus, sulforaphane has an important role in modulating the downstream events triggered by the axis Nox2-aquaporin-8. Cell treatment with sulforaphane also reduced the expression of peroxiredoxin-1, which is increased in almost all acute myeloid leukemia subtypes. Interestingly, sulforaphane concentrations able to trigger these effects are achievable by dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables, confirming the importance of the beneficial effect of a diet rich in bioactive compounds.","['Prata, Cecilia', 'Facchini, Carlotta', 'Leoncini, Emanuela', 'Lenzi, Monia', 'Maraldi, Tullia', 'Angeloni, Cristina', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Hrelia, Silvana', 'Fiorentini, Diana']","['Prata C', 'Facchini C', 'Leoncini E', 'Lenzi M', 'Maraldi T', 'Angeloni C', 'Zambonin L', 'Hrelia S', 'Fiorentini D']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2766-9006', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1829-652X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3331-2513', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6731-6187', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7857-4512', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3537-4662']","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio, 48-40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio, 48-40126 Bologna, Italy.', ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto, 237-47921 Rimini, Italy."", 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio, 48-40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Policlinico, Via del Pozzo, 71-41124 Modena, Italy.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Via Gentile III da Varano, 62032 Camerino, Macerata, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio, 48-40126 Bologna, Italy.', ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto, 237-47921 Rimini, Italy."", 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio, 48-40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (aquaporin 8)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Aquaporins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2/metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfoxides']",PMC6276444,,2018/12/26 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/4125297 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2018 Nov 18;2018:4125297. doi: 10.1155/2018/4125297. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, the activity and pattern of ADA1, ADA2 and ADA1+cp were determined using ADA kit and electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, respectively. To confirm the presence of ADA enzyme, the fresh serums, extractions from erythrocytes, JM cell line as a human T lymphocyte line and J774 A.1 as mouse monocyte line were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel and stained with the specific dye. Results: The activities of ADA1 isoenzyme and total ADA in new cases and subjects with the relapsed disease were significantly higher than their activities in the patients in the remission stage and healthy controls (p<0.001). The unbounded ADA1 isoenzyme was found to exist in the erythrocyte, lymphocyte and monocyte. But in serum, all the ADA1 was bounded to the cp protein. Conclusions: ADA1 is the key isoenzyme elevating in ALL patients, therefore this isoenzyme could be a useful biomarker to diagnose ALL patients and monitor their therapies.","['Ebrahimi-Rad, Mina', 'Khatami, Shohreh', 'Ansari, Shahla', 'Jalylfar, Shohreh', 'Valadbeigi, Shirin', 'Saghiri, Reza']","['Ebrahimi-Rad M', 'Khatami S', 'Ansari S', 'Jalylfar S', 'Valadbeigi S', 'Saghiri R']",,"['Biochemistry Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, TehranIran.', 'Biochemistry Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, TehranIran.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology Ali Asghar Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, TehranIran."", 'Biochemistry Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, TehranIran.', 'Biochemistry Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, TehranIran.', 'Biochemistry Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, TehranIran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Serbia,J Med Biochem,Journal of medical biochemistry,101315490,,,,PMC6294093,,2018/12/26 06:00,2018/12/26 06:01,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/jomb-2017-0042 [doi]', 'jomb-2017-0042 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Biochem. 2018 Apr 1;37(2):128-133. doi: 10.1515/jomb-2017-0042. eCollection 2018 Apr.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADA isoenzymes', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)', 'Adenosine Deaminase (ADA)', 'agarose gel', 'electrophoresis']",,,20180401,,"['Conflict of interest statement:The authors stated that they have no conflicts of', 'interest regarding the publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients receive chemotherapy during treatment, which lead to severe mucositis of gastrointestinal tract and myelosuppression. It was hypothesized that the gut colonizer translocate into the blood circulation causing BSI. Colonization rate with CRE among these patients in India is unknown. Aim: This study aims to determine the carriage rate of CRE in cancer patients. Setting and Design: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of India. Materials and Methods: Rectal swab of 93 patients were collected and processed as per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention protocol for detection of CRE. The isolate CREs were identified by standard phenotypic tests and confirmed for carbapenem resistance by disk diffusion test using carbapenem disk (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem), Carba-NP test and modified Hodge test. Resistant to any of the carbapenem disc is considered as CRE. Results: A total of 86 isolates were detected from 93 patients. Seventy-six isolates were identified as CRE, and 10 isolates were Gram-positive cocci and other Gram-negative bacilli. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common clinical presentation followed by acute lymphoid leukemia. Thirty-nine out of 93 patients were on chemotherapy. Sixty-seven out of 76 isolates of CRE were observed positive for carbapenemase production by Carba-NP test. Conclusion: This study highlights very high rate of CRE carriage among the hematological malignancy patients; who are highly vulnerable to infection. This confirms the need of infection control prevention activities among the hematological malignancy patients.","['Kumar, Amarjeet', 'Mohapatra, Sarita', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Sreenivas, V', 'Das, Bimal K', 'Sood, Seema', 'Kapil, Arti']","['Kumar A', 'Mohapatra S', 'Bakhshi S', 'Mahapatra M', 'Sreenivas V', 'Das BK', 'Sood S', 'Kapil A']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Dr. B.

Additionally, the gradual emergence of next-generation sequencing has progressively expanded our evolving understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CNL and its therapeutic potential. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation remains the primary therapeutic option for the effective treatment of CNL. In this comprehensive review, we highlight the contemporaneous classification, diagnostic criteria, and molecular pathogenesis of CNL. We also discuss the therapeutic implications of the heterogeneous molecular fingerprint of CNL, focusing on emerging targeted therapies, specifically inhibitors of JAK and MAPK signaling pathways.","['Venugopal, Sangeetha', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Venugopal S', 'Mascarenhas J']",,"['Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.

This synergy reflects activation of cyclins and cdks by DYRK1A inhibition, accompanied by simultaneous reductions in key cell-cycle inhibitors (CDKN1C and CDKN1A). The latter results from interference with the basal Trithorax- and SMAD-mediated transactivation of CDKN1C and CDKN1A. Notably, combined DYRK1A and TGFbeta inhibition allows preservation of beta cell differentiated function.

SoNar-high cells mainly home to and locate in the hypoxic endosteal niche and maintain their activities through efficient symmetric division. SoNar can indicate the dynamics of metabolic changes of LICs in the endosteal niche.

Ponatinib, an oral drug, was discovered as an efficient BCR-ABL inhibitor by addressing imatinib drug resistance arising due to the point mutations at its active sites. In this study, 44 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, which are derivatives of ponatinib, were used to develop a robust two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) and 3D-Pharmacophore models by dividing dataset into 32 training sets and 12 test set molecules. 2D-QSAR model was developed using Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm consisting of four types of information-rich molecular descriptors, electrotopological (ES_Count_aasN and ES_Sum_aaaC), electronic (Dipole_X), spatial (PMI_Y) and thermodynamic (LogD), primarily contributing to BCR-ABL kinase inhibitory activity. For the best 2D-QSAR model, the statistics were R(2) = 0.8707, R(2)pred = 0.8142 and N = 32 for the training set molecules. Phase module of Schrodinger suit was employed for 3D-Pharmacophore model development showing five different pharmacophoric features - ADHHPRR with good R(2) of 0.9629, F of 175.3, Q(2) of 0.645 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.214 that are essential for an effective BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. These two models were further validated by cross-validation, test set predictions, enrichment factor calculations and predictions based on the external dataset. The molecular mechanism of resistance arising due to gate keeper mutation T315I of ABL kinase in complex with its inhibitors was also studied using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed models predicted key chemical features for designing potent inhibitors against BCR-ABL kinase activity and its resistance mechanism to CML disease therapy. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TLS usually occurs in aggressive hematologic malignancies such as Burkitt lymphoma and acute leukemia. TLS has rarely been observed in multiple myeloma (MM). CASE REPORT: We present 2 patients with relapsed MM who developed TLS after the first cycle of carfilzomib treatment. CONCLUSION: Carfilzomib is a next-generation proteasome inhibitor with proven efficacy in relapsed/refractory MM. Recently, increasing frequency of TLS has been reported in MM, especially after treatment with proteasome inhibitors. The potential complications of TLS should be considered especially during the first cycle of carfilzomib treatment.","['Terzi Demirsoy, Esra', 'Birtas Atesoglu, Elif', 'Eren, Necmi', 'Geduk, Ayfer', 'Mehtap, Ozgur', 'Tarkun, Pinar', 'Hacihanefioglu, Abdullah']","['Terzi Demirsoy E', 'Birtas Atesoglu E', 'Eren N', 'Geduk A', 'Mehtap O', 'Tarkun P', 'Hacihanefioglu A']",,"['Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Nephrology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligopeptides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300891618793817 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumori. 2019 Dec;105(6):NP24-NP27. doi: 10.1177/0300891618793817.

The occurrence of infusion-related reactions (IRR), especially during the first infusion, is one of the main concerns of rituximab, otherwise well tolerated. Although IRR are usually mild to moderate, fatal evolutions have been reported. These reactions are not specific to rituximab and also observed with other compounds, including those recruiting effectors cells. Further studies are required to predict the frequency and severity of such reactions, to avoid life-threatening complications, especially in the first-in-human studies. Areas covered: This review reports data available to date on the occurrence of IRR induced by rituximab. Then, factors associated with IRR are described, with proposed pathogenic mechanisms of IRR. Finally, different methods to prevent and manage IRR are reported. Expert opinion: Various factors have been associated with the occurrence and severity of IRR. A predictive model of IRR is of importance to prevent life-threatening IRR or detrimental interruption of rituximab therapy. This model would combine parameters, such as the number of CD20 positive cells and NK cells (CD16 positive), together with the level of CD20 and CD16 expressions, and FCGR3Apolymorphism.","['Paul, Franciane', 'Cartron, Guillaume']","['Paul F', 'Cartron G']",,"[""a Departement d'Hematologie Clinique , CHRU de Montpellier , Montpellier , France."", 'b CNRS UMR 5235 , Universite de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', ""a Departement d'Hematologie Clinique , CHRU de Montpellier , Montpellier , France."", 'b CNRS UMR 5235 , Universite de Montpellier , Montpellier , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Clin Immunol,Expert review of clinical immunology,101271248,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,2018/12/26 06:00,2020/05/26 06:00,['2018/12/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1744666X.2019.1562905 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 2019 Apr;15(4):383-389. doi: 10.1080/1744666X.2019.1562905.

Inducing AML cell differentiation has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the therapy of AML. Icariside II, an active component of Herba Epimedii, has been well defined to promote osteogenic differentiation. However, the differentiation-inducing effect of Icariside II on AML cells has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the differentiation-inducing effect and underlying mechanism of Icariside II in AML HL-60 and THP-1 cell lines. Icariside II induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest by down-regulating Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) and up-regulating Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p21 and p27). Importantly, Icariside II could induce differentiation of AML cells, accompanied by the up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylated p38. Further study indicated the cell cycle arrest and differentiation induced by Icariside II could be abrogated by TLR8-specific inhibitor CU-CPT9a.

However, much of the mechanisms of action, such as the development of memory responses and sources of immune cytokines, remain elusive largely due to the challenge of characterizing human CAR T cell function in vivo. The lack of a suitable in vivo model also hinders the development of new CAR T cell therapies. METHODS: We established a humanized mouse (hu-mouse) model with a functional human immune system and genetically-matched (autologous) primary acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that permits modeling of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy in immunocompetent hosts without allogeneic or xenogeneic immune responses. FINDINGS: Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were detected in blood of leukemic hu-mice with kinetics and levels similar to those seen in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy. The levels of CAR T cells were correlated inversely with the burden of leukemia cells and positively with the survival times in anti-CD19 CAR T cell-treated leukemic hu-mice. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells also resulted in rapid production of T cell- and monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines and an increase in frequency of regulatory T cells as reported in clinical studies. INTERPRETATION: These results provide a proof-of-principle that this novel preclinical model has the potential to be used to model human CAR T cell therapy and facilitate the design of new CARs with improved antitumor activity.","['Jin, Chun-Hui', 'Xia, Jinxing', 'Rafiq, Sarwish', 'Huang, Xin', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Zhou, Xianzheng', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Yang, Yong-Guang']","['Jin CH', 'Xia J', 'Rafiq S', 'Huang X', 'Hu Z', 'Zhou X', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Yang YG']",,"['Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China; International Center of Future Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States.', 'Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, United States.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China; International Center of Future Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China; International Center of Future Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States.

Current available chemotherapeutics are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, therefore, the search for new molecules with antitumor activity, specific and selective for neoplastic cells, became a great challenge for researchers in the oncology field. As pyrazolines stand out in the literature for their great variety of biological activities, the aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antileukemic activity of five new pyrazoline derivatives. All pyrazolines showed adequate physicochemical properties for a good oral bioavailability. The two unpublished and most effective pyrazoline derivatives have been selected for further experiments. These compounds are highly selective for leukemic cells when compared to non-neoplastic cells and did not cause lysis on human red blood cells. Additionally, selected pyrazolines induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and decreased cell proliferation marker KI67. Apoptotic cell death induced by selected pyrazolines was confirmed by morphological analysis, assessment of phosphatidylserine residue exposure and DNA fragmentation. Several factors indicate that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis occurred. These were: increased FasR expression; the predominance of Bax in relation to Bcl-2; the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; AIF release; decreased expression of survivin (an antiapoptotic protein); and the activation of caspase-3. The selected pyrazolines were also found to be cytotoxic against neoplastic cells collected from the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia.","['Stefanes, Natalia Marceli', 'Toigo, Jessica', 'Maioral, Mariana Franzoni', 'Jacques, Amanda Virtuoso', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre, Louise Domeneghini', 'Perondi, Daiane Mari', 'Ribeiro, Amanda Abdalla Biasi', 'Bigolin, Alisson', 'Pirath, Iris Mattos Santos', 'Duarte, Bruna Fischer', 'Nunes, Ricardo Jose', 'Santos-Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Stefanes NM', 'Toigo J', 'Maioral MF', 'Jacques AV', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre LD', 'Perondi DM', 'Ribeiro AAB', 'Bigolin A', 'Pirath IMS', 'Duarte BF', 'Nunes RJ', 'Santos-Silva MC']",,"['Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Clinical Analysis Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

She was referred to our hospital complaining persistent sore throat since 2weeks ago. Fiberscopic observation proved the presence of white tumor-like mass on her right arytenoid of the larynx. As CT image demonstrated that the mass was localized at the arytenoid region with central low-density area surrounded by granulation tissue, we underwent biopsy under local anesthesia. Excision of the mass proved it to be a soft granulation including sulfur granules. Oral administration of amoxicillin 750mg per day was initiated as a postoperative medication. On day 17, histological study confirmed that the tumor-like mass was Actinomyces granuloma, and therefore amoxicillin administration continued. The medication was effective to subside the disease and the arytenoid lesion healed on day 31. Amoxicillin was further administered until day 70 to prevent recurrence.

Alu sequences lie in gene-rich regions, so their methylation is an important transcriptional regulation mechanism. Aberrant Alu methylation has been associated with tumor aggressiveness, and also previously discussed in hematological malignancies, by applying different approaches. Moreover, today different techniques designed to measure global DNA methylation are focused on the methylation level of specific repeat elements. In this work we propose a new method of investigating Alu differential methylation, based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology. METHODS: Forty-six patients with hematological neoplasms were included in the study: 30 patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 7 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes at intermediate/high risk, according with the International Prognostic Scoring System, and 9 patients with myelomonocytic leukemia. Ten healthy donors were included as controls. Acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 cell line, either untreated or treated with decitabine (DEC) hypomethylating agent, was also analyzed. DNA samples were investigated for Alu methylation level by digestion of genomic DNA with isoschizomers with differential sensitivity to DNA methylation, followed by ddPCR. RESULTS: Using ddPCR, a significant decrease of the global Alu methylation level in DNA extracted from NB4 cells treated with DEC, as compared to untreated cells, was observed. Moreover, comparing the global Alu methylation levels at diagnosis and after azacytidine (AZA) treatment in MDS patients, a statistically significant decrease of Alu sequences methylation after therapy as compared to diagnosis was evident. We also observed a significant decrease of the Alu methylation level in CLL patients compared to HD, and, finally, for CMML patients, a decrease of Alu sequences methylation was observed in patients harboring the SRSF2 hotspot gene mutation c.284C>D. CONCLUSIONS: In our work, we propose a method to investigate Alu differential methylation based on ddPCR technology. This assay introduces ddPCR as a more sensitive and immediate technique for Alu methylation analysis. To date, this is the first application of ddPCR to study DNA repetitive elements. This approach may be useful to profile patients affected by hematologic malignancies for diagnostic/prognostic purpose.","['Orsini, Paola', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Parciante, Elisa', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Minervini, Crescenzio F', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Ricco, Alessandra', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Orsini P', 'Impera L', 'Parciante E', 'Cumbo C', 'Minervini CF', 'Minervini A', 'Zagaria A', 'Anelli L', 'Coccaro N', 'Casieri P', 'Tota G', 'Brunetti C', 'Ricco A', 'Carluccio P', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7926-6052'],"['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, P.zza G.

METHODS: 345 cases with ALL and their 1:1 age, gender, residence region matched controls aged 0-15 years were recruited from four hospitals in Henan Province from 2014 to 2016. Information was collected by interviews using a questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, residence region and relevant confounders was carried out to generate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Our data indicate that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation (adjusted OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.51-5.86) or pesticides (adjusted OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.67-2.28) increased the risk of childhood ALL. Various subgroup analyses stratified by child's gender, age at diagnosis and other factors also supported these results. However, no interaction was detected between exposure to internal housing renovation and pesticides using an additive model. No significant links between maternal exposures to, environmental tobacco smoking (ETS), antipyretic analgesia intake, or viral infectious diseases with risk of ALL were detected. CONCLUSION: Findings in our study are in line with the existing literatures, which support the hypothesis that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation and pesticides are risk factors for childhood ALL. Notably, we found no interaction between these two risk factors, these findings may inform prevention and early detection strategies.","['Wang, Yiran', 'Gao, Pan', 'Liang, Ge', 'Zhang, Ningning', 'Wang, Chunmei', 'Wang, Yingchao', 'Nie, Luting', 'Lv, Xuewei', 'Li, Wenjing', 'Guo, Qianqian', 'Jiang, Xiaowen', 'Lu, Jie']","['Wang Y', 'Gao P', 'Liang G', 'Zhang N', 'Wang C', 'Wang Y', 'Nie L', 'Lv X', 'Li W', 'Guo Q', 'Jiang X', 'Lu J']",,"['Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital Of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital Of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.

Penetrance and expressivity within families is often variable. There is a spectrum of bone marrow disease in symptomatic cytopenic patients ranging from hypocellular marrows without overt dysplasia to those with definitive MDS, AML, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Relatives of probands with the same mutations may demonstrate minimal disease manifestations and normal marrows. A comprehensive clinical, hematological and genetic assessment of 25 patients with germline GATA2 mutation was performed. MDS-associated mutations were identified in symptomatic GATA2 patients both with overt MDS and in those with hypocellular/aplastic bone marrows without definitive dysplasia. Healthy relatives of probands harboring the same germline GATA2 mutations had essentially normal marrows that were overall devoid of MDS-associated mutations. The findings suggest that abnormal clonal hematopoiesis is a common event in symptomatic germline mutated GATA2 patients with MDS and also in those with hypocellular marrows without overt morphologic evidence of dysplasia, possibly indicating a pre-MDS stage warranting close monitoring for disease progression.","['McReynolds, Lisa J', 'Yang, Yanqin', 'Yuen Wong, Hong', 'Tang, Jingrong', 'Zhang, Yubo', 'Mule, Matthew P', 'Daub, Janine', 'Palmer, Cindy', 'Foruraghi, Ladan', 'Liu, Qingguo', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Wang, Weixin', 'West, Robert R', 'Yohe, Marielle E', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Townsley, Danielle M', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Hourigan, Christopher S']","['McReynolds LJ', 'Yang Y', 'Yuen Wong H', 'Tang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Mule MP', 'Daub J', 'Palmer C', 'Foruraghi L', 'Liu Q', 'Zhu J', 'Wang W', 'West RR', 'Yohe ME', 'Hsu AP', 'Hickstein DD', 'Townsley DM', 'Holland SM', 'Calvo KR', 'Hourigan CS']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

There are conflicting data in the literature regarding the utility of a cranial irradiation boost in high-risk adult ALL without evidence of preexisting central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study investigates the posttransplant clinical outcomes of patients with high-risk adult ALL undergoing TBI conditioning for allo-HCT with or without a whole-brain boost, without overt CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a medical record analysis. We identified 58 patients who were treated between January 1998 and December 2016, and met our preset inclusion criteria of adults (age >18 years old) who carried a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of CNS-negative, high-risk ALL, who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with TBI conditioning. A multivariate analysis of correlation between patient outcomes and collected categorical variables was assessed with stepwise Cox logistic regression. Survival analyses were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier technique with a log-rank test. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 5.3 years, there was a statistically significant improvement in actuarial 7-year CNS relapse-free survival (100% vs 76.4%; P = .043) in favor of patients undergoing a cranial boost. There was no statistically significant improvement in 7-year progression-free survival (78.3% vs 62.5%; P = .076) or overall survival (49.4% vs 43.5%; P = .921) with versus without a cranial boost. On multivariate analysis, the presence of a cranial boost was the only identified variable with an independent relationship to CNS relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with high-risk, CNS-negative ALL were found to have a statistically significant improvement in CNS relapse-free survival and a trend toward improved progression-free survival with the inclusion of a cranial boost with TBI pretransplant conditioning. Our data indicate that further investigation into the use of cranial boost in this patient population is warranted.","['Famoso, Justin M', 'Grow, Joel L', 'Laughlin, Brady', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel', 'Stea, Baldassarre']","['Famoso JM', 'Grow JL', 'Laughlin B', 'Katsanis E', 'Stea B']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona; College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.

Resistance to chemotherapy decreases efficacy of the treatment and promotes cancer recurrence and metastases. One of the approaches to overcome drug resistance includes E2F1-mediated regulation of the small er, Cyrillic73 protein that belongs to the small er, Cyrillic53 family. Its DeltaNp73 isoform exhibits pro-oncogenic effects, and TAp73 - anti-oncogenic effects. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), often found in tumors, suppresses pro-apoptotic pathways and E2F1/p73 in particular. The activity of E2F1 and p73 transcription factors is linked to metabolism of biogenic polyamines. Therefore, it could be suggested that compounds that target polyamine-metabolizing enzymes can sensitize HCMV-infected hematological malignancies to doxorubicin. Here we report that HCMV infection of capital TE, Cyrilliccapital EN, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrillic-1 monocytic leukemic cells considerably elevates E2F1 levels and shifts the balance between the small er, Cyrillic73 isoforms towards DeltaNp73 leading to survival of DOX-treated leukemic cells. In contrast, MDL72.527, an inhibitor of polyamine catabolism, decreases DeltaNp73/capital TE, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrillicsmall er, Cyrillic73 ratio and thus restores sensitivity of the cells to DOX. Our findings indicate the combination of doxorubicin and MDL72.527 may present a novel strategy for therapy of leukemia in patients with and without HCMV infection.","['Fedorova, Natalia E', 'Chernoryzh, Yana Yu', 'Vinogradskaya, Galina R', 'Emelianova, Svetlana S', 'Zavalyshina, Larisa E', 'Yurlov, Kirill I', 'Zakirova, Natalia F', 'Verbenko, Valery N', 'Kochetkov, Sergey N', 'Kushch, Alla A', 'Ivanov, Alexander V']","['Fedorova NE', 'Chernoryzh YY', 'Vinogradskaya GR', 'Emelianova SS', 'Zavalyshina LE', 'Yurlov KI', 'Zakirova NF', 'Verbenko VN', 'Kochetkov SN', 'Kushch AA', 'Ivanov AV']",,"['Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'Konstantinov Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, National Research Center ""Kurchatov Institute"", Gatchina, Leningrad Region, Russia.', 'Konstantinov Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, National Research Center ""Kurchatov Institute"", Gatchina, Leningrad Region, Russia.', 'Educational Institution of Further Professional Education <<Russian Medical Academy of Continuous Professional Education>> of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.', 'Konstantinov Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, National Research Center ""Kurchatov Institute"", Gatchina, Leningrad Region, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.', 'Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.

However, the relationship between phase-specific susceptibility and MTA concentration, especially with respect to microtubule integrity, remains poorly defined. In addition, whether microtubule stabilizers and destabilizers act similarly or differ in the ability to induce interphase death is unclear. In order to resolve these uncertainties, we report here the results of a systematic comparison of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and HeLa cells treated with three different MTAs, namely the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and two microtubule destabilizers, vincristine, and eribulin. Both types of cells were sensitive to each MTA, with IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar range. Primary ALL cells arrested in mitosis when treated with paclitaxel at all tested concentrations, whereas the effects of vincristine or eribulin were concentration-dependent; low (<30nM) concentrations induced mitotic death whereas higher concentrations (>100nM) induced death directly in G1 phase. G1 phase death in response to higher concentrations of the destabilizers was associated with complete loss of interphase microtubule structure. In contrast, HeLa cells were only susceptible in M phase regardless of drug type or concentration.

It signals through a heterodimer receptor complex that consists of the LIF receptor (or LIFR formerly known as gp190) and the Interleukin 6 signal transducer (or IL6ST formerly known as gp130). LIF signaling is mediated mainly by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and has a wide variety of biological activities with pleiotropic effects on many cell types and organs among which are stem cell renewal and implantation process in mammalian embryo. Despite the wealth of data on LIF in mammalian cells, there is a paucity of information on its functions in lower vertebrates. Here, we provide information on the status and the function of LIF signaling in Xenopus amphibian. The IL6 cytokine family is highly conserved in Xenopus genome both at ligands and receptors levels. All cytokines and receptors of the family, except oncostatin M (OSM) and IL27, can be identified in the genome including the orthologs of LIF, cardiotrophin 1 (CTF1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), LIFR, IL6ST, IL6R, IL11RA and CNTFR. Lif mRNA is zygotically expressed after midblastula transition while lifr and il6st are maternally expressed. We have investigated the functions of LIF in Xenopus early development with a gain-of-function analysis combined to the use of a dominant negative form of the receptor. The overexpression of Xenopus lif in embryo activates STAT3 phosphorylation and induces a dramatic phenotype where embryos are ventralised and show a reduction of anterior structures with microcephaly. This results mainly from BMP signal stimulation and antagonism towards IGF signals. In addition, most embryos develop tumor-like cell masses according to both autonomous and non-autonomous processes. Through the use of a dominant negative form of the receptor, we demonstrate for the first time that a functional LIF signaling is required for normal vertebrate kidney development. Owing to its experimental advantages, the Xenopus embryo constitutes a useful model to identify the molecular actors that may account for the pleiotropic functions of LIF and their role in vertebrate development.","['Jalvy, Sandra', 'Veschambre, Philippe', 'Fedou, Sandrine', 'Rezvani, Hamid Reza', 'Theze, Nadine', 'Thiebaud, Pierre']","['Jalvy S', 'Veschambre P', 'Fedou S', 'Rezvani HR', 'Theze N', 'Thiebaud P']",,"['Univ.

METHODS: Data were abstracted from medical charts of patients with AML from 10 countries. Patients were grouped based on their FLT3 mutation status, age (18-64 or >/=65), and whether they were newly diagnosed (ND) or relapsed/refractory (R/R). RESULTS: Charts of 1027 AML patients were included (183 FLT3(mut) 18-64 ND; 136 FLT3(mut) >/=65 ND; 181 FLT3(mut) R/R; 186 FLT3(wt) 18-64 ND; 159 FLT3(wt) >/=65 ND; 182 FLT3(wt) R/R). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in treatment patterns for AML. Among ND patients 18-64, the most common initial treatment was standard-to-intermediate dose cytarabine-based therapies (43.2% for FLT3(mut) and 55.9% for FLT3(wt) ); among ND patients >/=65, the most common initial treatment was hypomethylating agent-based therapies (36.0% and 47.2%). Among R/R patients, the most common initial treatment after R/R was best supportive care only (39.8% and 24.7%). HRU was substantial across cohorts during both event-free and post-event periods. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment patterns of AML were heterogeneous and FLT3(mut) AML was treated more aggressively than FLT3(wt) disease. HRU was substantial for all cohorts, particularly after relapse or treatment failure.","['Griffin, James D', 'Yang, Hongbo', 'Song, Yan', 'Kinrich, David', 'Shah, Manasee V', 'Bui, Cat N']","['Griffin JD', 'Yang H', 'Song Y', 'Kinrich D', 'Shah MV', 'Bui CN']",,"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, Illinois.', 'Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Astellas Pharma US']",['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Resources', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Recurrence', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6850763,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2018/12/23 06:00'],"['2018/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13205 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Apr;102(4):341-350. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13205.

We present a series of 11 pediatric non-leukemic MPAL identified among 146 precursor lymphoblastic lymphomas included in the prospective trial Euro-LBL 02. Paraffin-embedded biopsies of 10 cases were suitable for molecular analyses using OncoScan assay (n = 7), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; n = 7) or both (n = 5). Except for one case with biallelic KMT2A (MLL) breaks, all cases analyzed by FISH lacked the most common translocations defining molecular subsets of lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas. Two non-leukemic B-myeloid MPALs showed the typical genomic profile of hyperdiploid precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia with gains of chromosomes 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 21. One B-T MPAL showed typical aberrations of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, such as copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) at 9p targeting a 9p21.3 deletion of CDKN2A and 11q12.2-qter affecting the ATM gene. ATM was also mutated in a T-myeloid MPAL case with additional loss at 7q21.2-q36.3 and mutation of NRAS, two alterations common in myeloid disorders. No recurrent regions of CNN-LOH were observed. The outcome under treatment was good with all patients being alive in first complete remission after treatment according to a protocol for precursor lymphoblastic lymphoma (follow-up 3-10 years, median: 4.9 years). In summary, the present series of non-leukemic MPALs widely lacked recurrently reported translocations in lymphoid/myeloid neoplasias and showed heterogeneous spectrum of chromosomal imbalances.","['Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Salaverria, Itziar', 'Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Chassagne-Clement, Catherine', 'Szczepanowski, Monika', 'Bens, Susanne', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Kabickova, Edita', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Oschlies, Ilske']","['Martin-Guerrero I', 'Salaverria I', 'Burkhardt B', 'Chassagne-Clement C', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Bens S', 'Klapper W', 'Zimmermann M', 'Kabickova E', 'Bertrand Y', 'Reiter A', 'Siebert R', 'Oschlies I']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4003-6855'],"['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', ""Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""NHL-BFM Study Center and Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany."", 'Department of Biopathology, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Ulm University & Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Motol, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, IHOP and Claude Bernard University, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, NHL-BFM-Study Center Justus Liebig University, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Ulm University & Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics', 'Genomic Instability/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/23 06:00'],"['2018/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22726 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Jun;58(6):365-372. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22726.

CRLF2 overexpression was recently identified in high-risk T-ALL patients. For these cases, no genomic abnormality was found to be associated with CRLF2 overexpression. IKZF1 has been recently shown to be a direct transcriptional regulator of CRLF2 expression. Moreover, it is known that NOTCH1 antagonizes IKZF1 in T-ALL. In light of these pieces of evidence, we reasoned that IKZF1 binding perturbation and CRLF2 upregulation could be associated in T-ALL. We evaluated two independent series of pediatric T-ALL cases (PHOP, n = 57 and TARGET, n = 264) for the presence of common T-ALL molecular abnormalities, such as NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. We also assessed CRLF2 and IKZF1 gene expression. CRLF2 overexpression was observed in 14% (PHOP) and 16% (TARGET) of T-ALL patients. No correlation was found between mRNA expression of CRLF2 and IKZF1 in both cohorts. Interestingly, we show that patients with mutations affecting NOTCH1-PEST domain and/or FBXW7 had higher CRLF2 expression (P = .04).

We compared arginase cytotoxicity with asparaginase, currently used in pre-B ALL treatment, and characterised the forms of cell death induced in a pre-B ALL cell line 697. Arginase and asparaginase both efficiently killed 697 cells and mature B lymphoma cell line Ramos, but neither enzyme killed normal lymphocytes. Arginase depleted cellular arginine, and arginase-treated media induced cell death, blocked by addition of arginine or arginine-precursor citrulline. Asparaginase depleted both asparagine and glutamine, and asparaginase-treated media induced cell death, blocked by asparagine, but not glutamine. Both enzymes induced caspase cleavage and activation, chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine exposure, indicating apoptosis. Both arginase- and asparaginase-induced death were blocked by caspase inhibitors, but with different sensitivities. BCL-2 overexpression inhibited arginase- and asparaginase-induced cell death, but did not prevent arginase-induced cytostasis, indicating a different mechanism of growth arrest. An autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, had no effect on the cell death induced by arginase, but doubled the cell death induced by asparaginase. In conclusion, arginase causes death of lymphoblasts by arginine-depletion induced apoptosis, via mechanism distinct from asparaginase. Therapeutic implications for childhood ALL include: arginase might be used as treatment (but antagonised by dietary arginine and citrulline), chloroquine may enhance efficacy of asparaginase treatment, and partial resistance to arginase and asparaginase may develop by BCL-2 expression. Arginase or asparaginase might potentially be used to treat Burkitt lymphoma.","['Metayer, Lucy E', 'Brown, Richard D', 'Carlebur, Saskia', 'Burke, G A Amos', 'Brown, Guy C']","['Metayer LE', 'Brown RD', 'Carlebur S', 'Burke GAA', 'Brown GC']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 OQQ, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK. gcb3@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['10027/LLR_/Bloodwise/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arginase/*pharmacology/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*drug effects/physiology']",PMC6373273,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2018/12/23 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-018-1506-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-018-1506-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2019 Feb;24(1-2):145-156. doi: 10.1007/s10495-018-1506-3.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Arginase', '*Asparaginase', '*Cell death', '*Leukaemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) phosphatase inhibitor that enhances cell glycolysis and facilitates tumor cell proliferation. Inhibition of its activity can induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Currently, little is known about the role of PDKs in AML. Therefore, we screened The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for de novo AML patients with complete clinical information and PDK family expression data, and 84 patients were included for the study. These patients did not undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Univariate analysis showed that high expression of PDK2 was associated with shorter EFS (P = 0.047), and high expression of PDK3 was associated with shorter OS (P = 0.026). In multivariate analysis, high expression of PDK3 was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (P < 0.05). In another TCGA cohort of AML patients who underwent allo-HSCT (n = 71), PDK expression was not associated with OS (all P > 0.05). Our results indicated that high expressions of PDK2 and PDK3, especially the latter, were poor prognostic factors of AML, and the effect could be overcome by allo-HSCT.","['Cui, Longzhen', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Liu, Yan', 'Dai, Yifeng', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Cui, Wei', 'Zhang, Qingyi', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Fu, Lin']","['Cui L', 'Cheng Z', 'Liu Y', 'Dai Y', 'Pang Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Ke X', 'Cui W', 'Zhang Q', 'Shi J', 'Fu L']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-6422', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2416-7572']","['Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515041, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515041, China.', 'Immunoendocrinology, Division of Medical Biology, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Haidian Hospital, Beijing Haidian Section of Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100080, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Air Force PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China. fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PDK2 protein, human)', '0 (PDK3 protein, human)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase/analysis/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2018/12/23 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-018-0071-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-018-0071-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;27(1-2):15-21. doi: 10.1038/s41417-018-0071-9.

There is growing evidence that relapses may be explained not only by resistance to chemotherapy but also by the escape of tumor cells from the control of the allogeneic immune response. Mechanisms of immune evasion can involve abrogation of leukemia cell recognition due to loss of HLA genes, immunosuppression by immune-checkpoint ligand expression, production of anti-inflammatory factors, release of metabolically active enzymes, loss of proinflammatory cytokine production, and acquisition of novel driver mutations that promote leukemia outgrowth. These mechanisms, and therapeutic targeting of immune escape, will be discussed. We divide the evidence in support of immune-escape mechanisms into animal studies, human laboratory studies, and human clinical experience.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel custom platform designated as Ultra-rapid Reporting of GENomic Targets (URGENTseq), an integrated solution that includes workflow optimization and an innovative custom bioinformatics pipeline to provide targeted NGS results on fresh peripheral blood and bone marrow samples within an actionable time period. URGENTseq was validated for clinical use by determining mutant allelic frequency and minimum coverage in silico to achieve 100% concordance for all positive and negative calls between the URGENTseq and conventional sequencing approach. URGENTseq enables the reporting of selected genes useful for immediate diagnosis (CALR, CSF3R, JAK2, KRAS, MPL, NPM1, NRAS, SF3B1) and treatment decisions (IDH1, IDH2) in hematologic malignancies within 48 hours of specimen collection.

In this study, the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and HBZ as viral elements and AKT1, BAD, FOXP3, RORgammat and IFNlambda3 as the host factors were investigated. METHODS: The study was conducted in ATLLs, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patients (HAM/TSPs) and HTLV-1-asympthomatic carriers (ACs). The DNA and mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for gene expression assessments via qRT-PCR, TaqMan assay, and then confirmed by western blotting. RESULTS: As it was expected, the HTLV-1-PVL were higher in ATLLs than ACs (P = 0.002) and HAM/TSP (P = 0.041). The HBZ expression in ATLL (101.76 +/- 61.3) was radically higher than in ACs (0.12 +/- 0.05) and HAM/TSP (0.01 +/- 0.1) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the AKT1 expression in ATLLs (13.52 +/- 4.78) was higher than ACs (1.17 +/- 0.27) (P = 0.05) and HAM/TSPs (0.72 +/- 0.49) (P = 0.008). However, BAD expression in ATLL was slightly higher than ACs and HAM/TSPs and not significant. The FOXP3 in ATLLs (41.02 +/- 24.2) was more than ACs (1.44 +/- 1) (P = 0.007) and HAM/TSP (0.45 +/- 0.15) (P = 0.01). However, RORgammat in ATLLs (27.43 +/- 14.8) was higher than ACs (1.05 +/- 0.32) (P = 0.02) but not HAM/TSPs. Finally, the IFNlambda3 expression between ATLLs (31.92 +/- 26.02) and ACs (1.46 +/- 0.63) (P = 0.01) and ACs and HAM/TSPs (680.62 +/- 674.6) (P = 0.02) were statistically different, but not between ATLLs and HAM/TSPs. CONCLUSIONS: The present and our previous study demonstrated that HTLV-1-PVL and HBZ and host AKT1 and Rad 51 are novel candidates for molecular targeting therapy of ATLL. However, high level of RORgammat may inhibit Th1 response and complicated in ATLL progressions.","['Tarokhian, Hanieh', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Mosavat, Arman', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Bari, Alireza', 'Ramezani, Samaneh', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim']","['Tarokhian H', 'Rahimi H', 'Mosavat A', 'Shirdel A', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Akbarin MM', 'Bari A', 'Ramezani S', 'Rezaee SA']",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, Zip code: 9177948564, Iran.', 'Immunology Research center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, Zip code: 9177948564, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, Zip code: 9177948564, Iran.', 'Immunology Research center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, Zip code: 9177948564, Iran.

Exciting progresses have been made at all fronts since then, including (1) sweeping approval of six agents by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway for treatment of 13 cancer types; (2) a paradigm shifting indication of PD-1 and CTLA4 blockers for the management of a broad class of cancers with DNA mismatch repair defect, the first-ever tissue agnostic approval of cancer drugs; (3) real world practice of adoptive T cell therapy with two CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell products (CAR-T) for relapsed and/or refractory B cell malignancies including acute lymphoid leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, signaling the birth of a field now known as synthetic immunology; (4) the award of 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine from the Nobel Committee to Tasuku Honjo and James Allison ""for their discovery of cancer medicine by inhibition of negative immune regulation"" ( www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018 ); and (5) the emerging new concept of normalizing rather than amplifying anti-tumor immunity for guiding the next wave of revolution in the field of immuno-oncology (IO) (Sanmamed and Chen, Cell 2018).This article will highlight the significant developments of immune-oncology as of October 2018. The US FDA approved indications of all seven immune checkpoint blockers, and two CD19-directed CAR-T products are tabulated for easy references. We organized our discussion into the following sections: introduction, cell therapy, emerging immunotherapeutic strategies, expediting oncology drug development in an era of breakthrough therapies, new concepts in cancer immunology and immunotherapy, and concluding remarks. Many of these topics were covered by the 2018 China Cancer Immunotherapy Workshop in Beijing, the fourth annual conference co-organized by the Chinese American Hematologist and Oncologist Network (CAHON), China FDA (CFDA; now known as China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA)), and the Tsinghua University. We significantly expanded our discussion of important IO developments beyond what were covered in the conference, and proposed a new Three Rs conceptual framework for cancer immunotherapy, which is to reverse tolerance, rejuvenate the immune system, and restore immune homeostasis. We conclude that the future of immuno-oncology as a distinct discipline of cancer medicine has arrived.","['Li, Zihai', 'Song, Wenru', 'Rubinstein, Mark', 'Liu, Delong']","['Li Z', 'Song W', 'Rubinstein M', 'Liu D']",,"['Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA. zihai@musc.edu.', 'Chinese American Hematologist and Oncologist Network, New York, NY, USA. zihai@musc.edu.', 'Chinese American Hematologist and Oncologist Network, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Chinese American Hematologist and Oncologist Network, New York, NY, USA.', 'New York Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA186866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Beijing', 'China', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy']",PMC6303854,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2018/12/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0684-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0684-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Dec 21;11(1):142. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0684-3.,,,,,,,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow cytokine network is therefore important, and the mediator release profile seems more important than single mediators. It is not known whether the characterization of primary AML cell proteomes reflects the heterogeneity of the broad and dynamic constitutive mediator release profile by these cells. To address this, we compared the intracellular levels of 41 proteins in 19 AML patients with the constitutive extracellular release during in vitro culture, including chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and protease regulators. The constitutive release of most mediators showed a wide variation (up to 2000-fold differences) between patients. Detectable intracellular levels were seen for 10 of 41 mediators, but for most of these 10 mediators we could not detect significant correlations between the constitutive release during in vitro culture and their intracellular levels. Intracellular protein levels in primary human AML cells do not reflect the dynamics, capacity, and variation between patients in constitutive mediator release profiles. Measurements of these profiles thus add complementary information to proteomic detection/quantification regarding the heterogeneity of the AML cell contributions to the bone marrow cytokine network.","['Aasebo, Elise', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Aasebo E', 'Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Selheim F', 'Berven FS', 'Brenner AK', 'Bruserud O']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059'],"['Department of Clinical Science, Section for Hematology, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.

She complained of progressive cough and dyspnea shortly after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy given for graft-vs-host disease. Computed tomography demonstrated diffuse ground-glass opacities in the lungs, and pulmonary function test revealed restrictive impairment. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed milky appearance, and transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed foamy macrophages infiltrating the alveoli. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having lipoid pneumonia. Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) promptly improved the symptoms, pulmonary shadows, and pulmonary function. The findings and clinical course of this case suggest that lipoid pneumonia should be recognized as one of the pulmonary complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Sakurai, M', 'Kato, J', 'Toyama, T', 'Hashida, R', 'Yamane, Y', 'Abe, R', 'Koda, Y', 'Kohashi, S', 'Kikuchi, T', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Nukaga, S', 'Ueda, S', 'Fukunaga, K', 'Okamoto, S', 'Mori, T']","['Sakurai M', 'Kato J', 'Toyama T', 'Hashida R', 'Yamane Y', 'Abe R', 'Koda Y', 'Kohashi S', 'Kikuchi T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Nukaga S', 'Ueda S', 'Fukunaga K', 'Okamoto S', 'Mori T']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

Paraspeckles as nuclear sub-structures are placed in the nucleus interchromatin area and participate in the regulation of gene expression through various mechanisms including mRNA retaining, mRNA breakage, A-to-I editing and protein seizing. Several studies have noted participation of NEAT1 in the pathogenesis of human malignancies. Notably, studies have revealed distinct roles for this lncRNA in the pathogenesis of cancer. While most cancerous tissues exhibit up-regulation of NEAT1, expression of this lncRNA has been down-regulated in leukemia and multiple myeloma. Such distinctive pattern of expression implies diverse roles for this lncRNA in solid tumor versus hematological malignancies. Critical roles of NEAT1 in regulation of apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation, invasion and metastasis in several tissues indicate that this lncRNA might be a therapeutic target in various cancers. Moreover, expression level of this lncRNA in tumoral tissues has been associated with survival of patients. Consequently, this lncRNA might be regarded as biomarker for patients' follow-up.","['Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh', 'Taheri, Mohammad']","['Ghafouri-Fard S', 'Taheri M']",,"['Department of Medical Genetics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Urogenital Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The anticancer effects of L-ASC involve its autoxidation and generation of H2O2, which is selectively toxic to malignant cells. Here we present that thioredoxin antioxidant system plays a key role in the scavenging of extracellularly-generated H2O2 in malignant B-cells. We show that inhibition of peroxiredoxin 1, the enzyme that removes H2O2 in a thioredoxin system-dependent manner, increases the sensitivity of malignant B-cells to L-ASC. Moreover, we demonstrate that auranofin (AUR), the inhibitor of the thioredoxin system that is used as an antirheumatic drug, diminishes the H2O2-scavenging capacity of malignant B-cells and potentiates pharmacological ascorbate anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. The addition of AUR to L-ASC-treated cells triggers the accumulation of H2O2 in the cells, which results in iron-dependent cytotoxicity. Importantly, the synergistic effects are observed at as low as 200microML-ASC concentrations. In conclusion, we observed strong, synergistic, cancer-selective interaction between L-ASC and auranofin. Since both of these agents are available in clinical practice, our findings support further investigations of the efficacy of pharmacological ascorbate in combination with auranofin in preclinical and clinical settings.","['Graczyk-Jarzynka, Agnieszka', 'Goral, Agnieszka', 'Muchowicz, Angelika', 'Zagozdzon, Radoslaw', 'Winiarska, Magdalena', 'Bajor, Malgorzata', 'Trzeciecka, Anna', 'Fidyt, Klaudyna', 'Krupka, Joanna Alicja', 'Cyran, Julia', 'Szczygiel, Kacper', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Jagielski, Adam', 'Siudakowska, Karolina', 'Bobrowicz, Malgorzata', 'Klopotowska, Marta', 'Barankiewicz, Joanna', 'Malenda, Agata', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Miazek-Zapala, Nina', 'Skarzynski, Piotr Henryk', 'Domagala, Antoni', 'Golab, Jakub', 'Firczuk, Malgorzata']","['Graczyk-Jarzynka A', 'Goral A', 'Muchowicz A', 'Zagozdzon R', 'Winiarska M', 'Bajor M', 'Trzeciecka A', 'Fidyt K', 'Krupka JA', 'Cyran J', 'Szczygiel K', 'Efremov DG', 'Gobessi S', 'Jagielski A', 'Siudakowska K', 'Bobrowicz M', 'Klopotowska M', 'Barankiewicz J', 'Malenda A', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Miazek-Zapala N', 'Skarzynski PH', 'Domagala A', 'Golab J', 'Firczuk M']",,"['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nielubowicza 5 Street, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.

However, its application in the clinical setting is still challenging. We hypothesized that a 19-gene AML-targeted NGS panel could be a valid approach to obtain clinically relevant information. Thus, we assessed the ability of this panel to classify AML patients according to diagnostic and prognostic indexes in a cohort of 162 patients. The assay yielded a median read depth >2000x, with 88% of on-target reads and a mean uniformity >93% without significant global strand bias. The method was sensitive and specific, with a valid performance at the clinical variant allele frequency cutoff of 3% for point mutations and 5% for insertions or deletions (INDELs). Three-hundred thirty-nine variants were found (36% INDELs and 64% single nucleotide variants). Concordance between NGS and other conventional techniques was 100%, but the NGS approach was able to identify more clinically relevant mutations. Finally, all patients could be classified into one of the 2016 World Health Organization diagnostic categories and virtually all into the recently proposed prognostic indexes (2017 European LeukemiaNet and Genomic classification). To sum up, we validate a reliable and reproducible method for AML diagnosis and demonstrate that small, well-designed NGS panels are sufficient to guide clinical decisions according to the current standards.","['Alonso, Carmen M', 'Llop, Marta', 'Sargas, Claudia', 'Pedrola, Laia', 'Panadero, Joaquin', 'Hervas, David', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Ibanez, Mariam', 'Ayala, Rosa', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Onecha, Esther', 'de Juan, Inmaculada', 'Palanca, Sarai', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Rodriguez-Veiga, Rebeca', 'Boluda, Blanca', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Barragan, Eva']","['Alonso CM', 'Llop M', 'Sargas C', 'Pedrola L', 'Panadero J', 'Hervas D', 'Cervera J', 'Such E', 'Ibanez M', 'Ayala R', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Onecha E', 'de Juan I', 'Palanca S', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Boluda B', 'Montesinos P', 'Sanz G', 'Sanz MA', 'Barragan E']",,"['Hematology Service, Arnau de Vilanova Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Clinical Pathology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain; La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomic Unit, La Fe Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomic Unit, La Fe Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.', 'Biostatistics Unit, La Fe Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, University Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid; Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, 12th of October Hospital (H12O-CNIO), Madrid; Department of Medicine, Madrid's Complutense University, Madrid, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, University Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid; Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, 12th of October Hospital (H12O-CNIO), Madrid; Department of Medicine, Madrid's Complutense University, Madrid, Spain."", 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Clinical Pathology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Clinical Pathology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain; Hematology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Clinical Pathology Service, La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain; La Fe Health Research Institute, Hematology Research Group, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Carlos III Health Research Institute, Madrid, Spain.

Of 20 patients with t(3;8)(q26.2,q24), 8 had therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 3 therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, 4 blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 relapsed AML, 1 AML transformed from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 blast phase of an unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasm, 1 de novo myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 de novo AML. Nineteen patients presented with cytopenia. Multilineage dysplasia was observed in 16/18 patients, and megakaryocytes were markedly decreased in 11/20 patients. Blasts showed a primitive myeloid immunophenotype in 17 patients, negative for myeloperoxidasein in 14/17, and aberrant CD7 expression in 5/17 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed MECOM rearrangement in 18/19 and MYC in 16/18 patients. Myc was shown to be expressed in all 14 cases assessed. Gene mutation testing was performed in 14 patients, and 7 showed at least one mutation including ASXL1 (2/6), TET2 (2/6), SRSF2 (2/6), and NRAS (2/13). At last clinical follow-up, 18 patients died and 2 were alive with persistent disease, with a median survival of 6 months. The authors conclude that t(3;8)(q26.2;q24) often leads to MECOM and MYC rearrangement, occurs predominantly in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms or at disease progression, and shares some similarities with myeloid neoplasms associated with inv(3)/GATA2-MECOM. Patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with t(3;8)(q26.2;q24) have a dismal outcome.","['Tang, Guilin', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Xie, Wei', 'Lin, Pei', 'Xu, Jie', 'Toruner, Gokce', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Gu, Jun', 'Doty, Madison', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tang, Zhenya']","['Tang G', 'Hu S', 'Wang SA', 'Xie W', 'Lin P', 'Xu J', 'Toruner G', 'Zhao M', 'Gu J', 'Doty M', 'Li S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tang Z']",,"['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

With this new era of personalized cancer immunotherapy, multiple challenges are present, ranging from implementation of a CAR-T program to safe delivery of the drug, long-term toxicity monitoring, and disease assessments. To address these issues experts representing the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the International Society of Cell and Gene Therapy, and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy formed a global CAR-T task force to identify and address key questions pertinent for hematologists and transplant physicians regarding the clinical use of anti CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with B-ALL. This article presents an initial roadmap for navigating common clinical practice scenarios that will become more prevalent now that the first commercially available CAR-T product for B-ALL has been approved.","['Kansagra, Ankit J', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Bar, Merav', 'Laetsch, Theodore W', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Bollard, Catherine M', 'Komanduri, Krishna V', 'Gastineau, Dennis A', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Perales, Miguel A', 'Hudecek, Michael', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Barrett, John A', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Gill, Saar I', 'Hill, Joshua', 'Kenderian, Saad', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Maloney, David', 'Liu, Hien D', 'Shah, Nirali N', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Johnston, Laura', 'Jacoby, Elad', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Porter, David L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K']","['Kansagra AJ', 'Frey NV', 'Bar M', 'Laetsch TW', 'Carpenter PA', 'Savani BN', 'Heslop HE', 'Bollard CM', 'Komanduri KV', 'Gastineau DA', 'Chabannon C', 'Perales MA', 'Hudecek M', 'Aljurf M', 'Andritsos L', 'Barrett JA', 'Bachanova V', 'Bonini C', 'Ghobadi A', 'Gill SI', 'Hill J', 'Kenderian S', 'Kebriaei P', 'Nagler A', 'Maloney D', 'Liu HD', 'Shah NN', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Shpall EJ', 'Mufti GJ', 'Johnston L', 'Jacoby E', 'Bazarbachi A', 'DiPersio JF', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Porter DL', 'Grupp SA', 'Sadelain M', 'Litzow MR', 'Mohty M', 'Hashmi SK']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Cell Therapy and Transplant Program, Abramson Cancer Center and the Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Children's Health, Dallas, Texas."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's National Health System, Washington, DC."", 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Health System, Miami, Florida.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', ""Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer; Centre d'Investigations Cliniques en Biotherapie, Universite d'Aix-Marseille, Inserm CBT 1409, Marseille, France."", 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Oncology Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Hematology, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Program, GW Cancer Center, George Washington University, Washington, DC.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Experimental Hematology Unit, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Cell Therapy and Transplant Program, Abramson Cancer Center and the Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Affiliated with the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'H.

This chalcone is a potent apoptotic inducer in human leukaemia U-937cells. Cell death was (i) mediated by the activation and the cleavage of initiator and executioner caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; (ii) prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, and by the selective caspase-3/7, -6 and -8 inhibitors, and by a cathepsins B/L inhibitor; (iii) associated with the release of mitochondrial proteins, including cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO; (iv) accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, (v) partially blocked by the inhibition of p38(MAPK) and (vi) mostly abrogated by catalase.

METHOD: Genotyping and expression analysis using TaqMan Small RNA Assay was performed on 71 patients with pathologically confirmed ALL and 74 control individuals. RESULTS: No statistically significant association was found between the 2 SNPs, its expression levels, and ALL risk. CONCLUSION: Haplotype analysis indicated a combination of allele A of rs57095329 and allele G of rs2910164 could represent a risk haplotype and an allele combination of G of rs57095329 and G of rs2910164 could represent a protective haplotype for ALL.","['Jemimah Devanandan, Helen', 'Venkatesan, Vettriselvi', 'Scott, Julius Xavier', 'Magatha, Latha Sneha', 'Durairaj Paul, Solomon Franklin', 'Koshy, Teena']","['Jemimah Devanandan H', 'Venkatesan V', 'Scott JX', 'Magatha LS', 'Durairaj Paul SF', 'Koshy T']",,"['Departments of Human Genetics, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.', 'Departments of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.', 'Departments of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Porur, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Lab Med,Laboratory medicine,0250641,"['0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['5255654 [pii]', '10.1093/labmed/lmy074 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Med. 2019 Jul 16;50(3):249-253. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmy074.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2018.

Host-virus interactions occurring at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels are critical for establishing an HCMV latent or lytic infection, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the expression of circRNAs in human leukemia monocytes (THP-1 cells) latently infected with HCMV and explored the diagnostic value of circRNAs in children with HCMV infection. A total of 2,110 and 1,912 circRNAs were identified in mock-infected and HCMV latent-infected THP-1 cells, respectively. Of these, we identified 1,421 differently expressed circRNAs, of which 650 were upregulated and 771 were downregulated. The host genes corresponding to the differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in the regulation of host cell secretion pathways, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis. The differentially expressed circRNAs had binding sites for microRNAs, suggesting an important role in the mechanism of HCMV latent infection. Furthermore, a clinical analysis showed that the expression levels of hsa_circ_0001445 and hsa_circ_0001206 were statistically significantly different in HCMV-infected patients vs. normal controls, suggesting that these circRNAs could potentially serve as biomarkers of HCMV-infection.","['Lou, Yun-Yan', 'Wang, Qiong-Dan', 'Lu, Yu-Tian', 'Tu, Meng-Yun', 'Xu, Xi', 'Xia, Ying', 'Peng, Ying', 'Lai, Mei-Mei', 'Zheng, Xiao-Qun']","['Lou YY', 'Wang QD', 'Lu YT', 'Tu MY', 'Xu X', 'Xia Y', 'Peng Y', 'Lai MM', 'Zheng XQ']",,"[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education , Wenzhou, Zhejiang , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Physiol Genomics,Physiological genomics,9815683,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytomegalovirus/physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Ontology', 'Host Microbial Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Circular/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/physiolgenomics.00096.2018 [doi]'],ppublish,Physiol Genomics. 2019 Feb 1;51(2):51-58. doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00096.2018.

Such effects among Asian populations remain uncertain. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of aspirin on prevention of different cancers among Chinese users. This population-based study utilized database from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority; adults with aspirin prescription for at least 6 months between 2000 and 2004 were included and followed up until 2013. Aspirin users were age-sex matched with non-aspirin users at a 1:2 ratio. Incidences of cancer were the primary outcome measured by relative risk (RR). A total of 204,170 aspirin users and 408,339 non-aspirin users were included, with the mean age 67.5 years, 7.7 years average duration of aspirin prescription and 80 mg as the median dose of aspirin. Cancer incidences were found in 26,929 (13.2%) aspirin users and 70,755 (17.3%) non-aspirin users. Compared with patients who had not been prescribed aspirin, aspirin usage led to significant reduction of cancers in liver (RR: 0.49), stomach (RR: 0.42), colorectum (RR: 0.71), lung (RR: 0.65), pancreas (RR: 0.54), oesophagus (RR: 0.59) and leukaemia (RR: 0.67). There was no demonstrable reduction of kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma in association with the usage of aspirin. Risk of breast cancer was shown to marginally increase (RR: 1.14) with aspirin usage. This study demonstrated that the long-term use of low-dose aspirin is associated with the reduction in risk of various cancers but not for breast cancer. Further investigation is needed before promoting aspirin as a primary chemoprotective agent.","['Tsoi, Kelvin K F', 'Ho, Jason M W', 'Chan, Felix C H', 'Sung, Joseph J Y']","['Tsoi KKF', 'Ho JMW', 'Chan FCH', 'Sung JJY']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5580-7686'],"['Stanley Ho Big Data Decision Analytics Research Centre, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Stanley Ho Big Data Decision Analytics Research Centre, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aspirin/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32083 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Jul 1;145(1):267-273. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32083.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of miR-410 in ALL cases and cells was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to evaluate the interaction between miR-410 and FKBP5. MTT and colony formation assay were used to determine the effect of miR-410 on the proliferation and colony formation ability of ALL cells. The effect of miR-410 on cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate 1 (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI). Western blot was used to analyze the effect of miR-410 on the protein expression levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and cleaved caspase-3. RESULTS: In our investigation, miR-410 was significantly up-regulated in ALL cases and cells. We searched three public databases to predict the potential target of miR-410, and found that FKBP5 was a direct target of miR-410. Meanwhile, Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed our hypothesis. The overexpression of miR-410 accelerated the proliferation and colony formation ability of ALL cells, whereas remarkably decreased cell apoptosis rate. Western blotting showed that miR-410 inhibited the activation of Akt signaling pathway. However, FKBP5 could reverse the effects of miR-410. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-410 regulated the proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of ALL cells through targeting FKBP5 and Akt signal pathway, indicating that miR-410 might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ALL.","['Qi, H-X', 'Cao, Q', 'Sun, X-Z', 'Zhou, W', 'Hong, Z', 'Hu, J', '-X Juan, C', 'Li, S', 'Kuai, W-X']","['Qi HX', 'Cao Q', 'Sun XZ', 'Zhou W', 'Hong Z', 'Hu J', '-X Juan C', 'Li S', 'Kuai WX']",,"[""Department Of Pediatrcis, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, China. kwx9743@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN410 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (tacrolimus binding protein 5)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201812_16647 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Dec;22(24):8797-8804. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201812_16647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of miR-152-3p in the bone marrow of 40 CML patients and 30 normal controls was detected by fluorescence quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). MiR-152-3p was up-regulated or down-regulated in the CML cell line (K562) by transfection with overexpressed lentivirus LV5-miR-152-3p or interfered lentivirus LV3-miR-152-3p, respectively. Transfection efficiency of miR-152-3p was detected by qRT-PCR. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was applied to measure the proliferation ability of K562 cells. Flow cytometry was used to assess the cell cycle and apoptosis rate of K562 cells after transfection. P27Kip1 (p27) was confirmed as the potential target of miR-152-3p by on-line target gene prediction software. Moreover, the interaction between miR-152-3p and p27 was analyzed by luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot. RESULTS: MiR-152-3p was highly expressed in the bone marrow of CML patients and cell lines. In vitro experiments indicated that the apoptosis rate of K562 cells in the lentivirus LV3-miR-152-3p interference group was significantly increased, and the cell cycle was arrested in G0G1 phase. Meanwhile, the proliferation of K562 cells was markedly inhibited. However, LV5-miR-152-3p transfection remarkably promoted the proliferation and cell cycle progression of K562 cells. We searched three online public databases to predict the potential target of miR-152-3p and found that p27 was a direct target of miR-152-3p. Luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot confirmed our hypothesis. In addition, subsequent experiments showed that up-regulation of p27 attenuated the effect of miR-152-3p on the ability of CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-152-3p was highly expressed in the bone marrow of CML patients and cells. Meanwhile, miR-152-3p inhibited the expression of its downstream protein p27, thus promoting the proliferation of K562 cells and the entry of cells into the cell cycle. In addition, it inhibited cell apoptosis, which might be a potential target for the incidence and development of CML.","['Wang, L', 'Wang, Y', 'Lin, J']","['Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Lin J']",,"['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, China. junlin330@sohu.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN152 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201812_16646 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Dec;22(24):8789-8796. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201812_16646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few cases that cannot be identified with PML-RARA by using conventional methods (karyotype analysis, FISH, and RT-PCR) involve abnormal promyelocytes that are fully in accordance with APL in morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype. To explore the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis and recurrence of morphologically diagnosed APL, we performed comprehensive variant analysis by next-generation sequencing in 111 pediatric patients morphologically diagnosed as APL. Structural variant (SV) analysis in 120 DNA samples from both diagnosis and relapse stage identified 95 samples with RARA rearrangement (including 94 with PML-RARA and one with NPM-RARA) and two samples with KMT2A rearrangement. In the eligible 13 RNA samples without any RARA rearrangement at diagnosis, one case each with CPSF6-RARG, NPM1-CCDC28A, and TBC1D15-RAB21 and two cases with a TBL1XR1-RARB fusion were discovered. These uncovered fusion genes strongly suggested their contributions to leukemogenesis as driver alternations and APL phenotype may arise by abnormalities of other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in retinoid signaling (RARB or RARG) or even by mechanisms distinct from the formation of aberrant retinoid receptors. Single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis in 77 children (80 samples) with RARA rearrangement showed recurrent alternations of primary APL in FLT3, WT1, USP9X, NRAS, and ARID1A, with a strong potential for involvement in pathogenesis, and WT1 as the only recurrently mutated gene in relapsed APL. WT1, NPM1, NRAS, FLT3, and NSD1 were identified as recurrently mutated in 17 primary samples without RARA rearrangement and WT1, NPM1, TP53, and RARA as recurrently mutated in 9 relapsed samples. The survival of APL with RARA rearrangement is much better than without RARA rearrangement. Thus, patients morphologically diagnosed as APL that cannot be identified as having a RARA rearrangement are more reasonably classified as a subclass of AML other than APL, and individualized treatment should be considered according to the genetic abnormalities.","['Zhao, Jie', 'Liang, Jian-Wei', 'Xue, Hui-Liang', 'Shen, Shu-Hong', 'Chen, Jing', 'Tang, Yan-Jing', 'Yu, Li-Sha', 'Liang, Huan-Huan', 'Gu, Long-Jun', 'Tang, Jing-Yan', 'Li, Ben-Shang']","['Zhao J', 'Liang JW', 'Xue HL', 'Shen SH', 'Chen J', 'Tang YJ', 'Yu LS', 'Liang HH', 'Gu LJ', 'Tang JY', 'Li BS']",,"[""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. tangjingyan@scmc.com.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. libenshang@scmc.com.cn."", 'Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. libenshang@scmc.com.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0338-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0338-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1387-1399. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0338-z.

These preclinical findings highlight potentially promising anti-post-MPN sAML activity of the combination of beta-catenin and BETP antagonists against post-MPN sAML BPCs.","['Saenz, Dyana T', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Mill, Christopher P', 'Qian, Yimin', 'Raina, Kanak', 'Rajapakshe, Kimal', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Soldi, Raffaella', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Nowak, Agnieszka J', 'Sun, Baohua', 'Saenz, David N', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Horrigan, Steve', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Qiu, Peng', 'Crews, Craig M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Saenz DT', 'Fiskus W', 'Manshouri T', 'Mill CP', 'Qian Y', 'Raina K', 'Rajapakshe K', 'Coarfa C', 'Soldi R', 'Bose P', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia TM', 'Khoury JD', 'Masarova L', 'Nowak AJ', 'Sun B', 'Saenz DN', 'Kornblau SM', 'Horrigan S', 'Sharma S', 'Qiu P', 'Crews CM', 'Verstovsek S', 'Bhalla KN']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2621-3584', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3256-0734', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8456-2005']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Arvinas, Inc., 5 Science Park, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Arvinas, Inc., 5 Science Park, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'beta Cat Pharma, 2450 Holcombe Blvd. Suite J606, Houston, TX, 77021, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'beta Cat Pharma, 2450 Holcombe Blvd. Suite J606, Houston, TX, 77021, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), 445 N.

However, there is scant work on patient samples and the role of hypomethylating agents on the bone marrow stromal cells of MDS patients is unclear. We show that human MDS-MSCs exhibit phenotypic, transcriptomic and epigenetic abnormalities. Stimuli provided by MDS-MSCs impaired the growth and function of healthy HSPCs, which is further sustained autonomously in HSPCs for significant periods of time resulting in a failure for active hematopoietic engraftment across primary and secondary transplant recipients (chimerism: 0.34-91% vs 2.78%, engraftment frequencies: at 0.06 +/- 0.02 vs full engraftment for MDS-MSC vs healthy groups, respectively). Hypomethylation of MDS-MSCs improved overall engraftment in most of the MDS-MSC groups tested (2/7 with p < 0.01, 3/7 with p < 0.05 and 2/7 with no significant difference). MDS-MSCs that fail to respond to hypomethylating therapy are associated with patients with rapid adverse disease transformation and this further suggests that MDS-MSCs may be an integral part of disease progression and have prognostic value as well as potential as a therapeutic target.","['Poon, Zhiyong', 'Dighe, Niraja', 'Venkatesan, Subhashree S', 'Cheung, Alice M S', 'Fan, Xiubo', 'Bari, Sudipto', 'Hota, Monalisa', 'Ghosh, Sujoy', 'Hwang, William Y K']","['Poon Z', 'Dighe N', 'Venkatesan SS', 'Cheung AMS', 'Fan X', 'Bari S', 'Hota M', 'Ghosh S', 'Hwang WYK']",,"['Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Clinical Translational Research, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disorders and Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disorders and Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore. william.hwang.y.k@singhealth.com.sg.', 'National Cancer Center, Singapore, Singapore. william.hwang.y.k@singhealth.com.sg.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore. william.hwang.y.k@singhealth.com.sg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6756222,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0310-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0310-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1487-1500. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0310-y.

Hence, single-cell studies are required to reveal the range of heterogeneity in their responses to defined perturbations, which provides detailed insight into signaling processes. Here, we present a time-lapse study using arrays of micro-trenches to monitor the timing of cell division and apoptosis in non-adherent cells at the single-cell level. By employing automated cell tracking and division detection, we precisely determine cell cycle duration and sister-cell correlations for hundreds of individual cells in parallel. As a model application we study the response of leukemia cells to the chemostatic drug vincristine as a function of cell cycle phase. The time-to-death after drug addition is found to depend both on drug concentration and cell cycle phase. The resulting timing and dose-response distributions were reproduced in control experiments using synchronized cell populations. Interestingly, in non-synchronized cells, the time-to-death intervals for sister cells appear to be correlated. Our study demonstrates the practical benefits of micro-trench arrays as a platform for high-throughput, single-cell time-lapse studies on cell cycle dependence, correlations and cell fate decisions in general.","['Chatzopoulou, E I', 'Raharja-Liu, P', 'Murschhauser, A', 'Sekhavati, F', 'Buggenthin, F', 'Vollmar, A M', 'Marr, C', 'Radler, J O']","['Chatzopoulou EI', 'Raharja-Liu P', 'Murschhauser A', 'Sekhavati F', 'Buggenthin F', 'Vollmar AM', 'Marr C', 'Radler JO']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2154-4552'],"['Faculty of Physics, Ludwig- Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Physics, Ludwig- Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Faculty of Physics, Ludwig- Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany. carsten.marr@helmholtz-muenchen.de.', 'Faculty of Physics, Ludwig- Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany. raedler@lmu.de.']",['eng'],"['GSC 1006/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research', 'Foundation)/International', 'EXC4/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Automation, Laboratory', '*Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation/methods', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Tracking', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Microtechnology/instrumentation/methods', '*Single-Cell Analysis/instrumentation/methods', 'Time-Lapse Imaging/instrumentation/methods', 'Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6303304,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-36508-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-36508-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Dec 21;8(1):18042. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-36508-8.,,,,,,,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a number of inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction have progressed to clinical testing as treatments for a variety of hematologic and solid tumor cancers, the results thus far have been mixed, with perhaps the strongest responses observed in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In an effort to improve the efficacy for this class of compounds, researchers have turned to targeted degradation of MDM2. IMiD-based MDM2 PROTAC 8, which potently reduces MDM2 protein levels through targeted degradation, exhibits enhanced efficacy in the RS4;11 xenograft model relative to a nondegrading MDM2-p53 inhibitor MI-1061.","['Wurz, Ryan P', 'Cee, Victor J']","['Wurz RP', 'Cee VJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1413-5208'],"['Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0', ""(4-(6''-chloro-4'-(3-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)-2''-oxodispiro(cyclohexane-1,2'-pyrro"", ""lidine-3',3''-indoline)-5'-carboxamido)benzoic acid)"", '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01945 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Jan 24;62(2):445-447. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01945.

To investigate the biology behind these CIMP subgroups, diagnostic samples from Nordic pediatric T-ALL patients were characterized by genome-wide methylation arrays, followed by targeted exome sequencing, telomere length measurement, and RNA sequencing. The CIMP subgroups did not correlate significantly with variations in epigenetic regulators. However, the CIMP+ subgroup, associated with better prognosis, showed indicators of longer replicative history, including shorter telomere length (P = 0.015) and older epigenetic (P < 0.001) and mitotic age (P < 0.001). Moreover, the CIMP+ subgroup had significantly higher expression of ANTP homeobox oncogenes, namely TLX3, HOXA9, HOXA10, and NKX2-1, and novel genes in T-ALL biology including PLCB4, PLXND1, and MYO18B. The CIMP- subgroup, with worse prognosis, was associated with higher expression of TAL1 along with frequent STIL-TAL1 fusions (2/40 in CIMP+ vs 11/24 in CIMP-), as well as stronger expression of BEX1. Altogether, our findings suggest different routes for leukemogenic transformation in the T-ALL CIMP subgroups, indicated by different replicative histories and distinct methylomic and transcriptomic profiles. These novel findings can lead to new therapeutic strategies.","['Haider, Zahra', 'Larsson, Par', 'Landfors, Mattias', 'Kohn, Linda', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Flaegstad, Trond', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Hultdin, Magnus', 'Degerman, Sofie']","['Haider Z', 'Larsson P', 'Landfors M', 'Kohn L', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Flaegstad T', 'Kanerva J', 'Heyman M', 'Hultdin M', 'Degerman S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2783-0712'],"['Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Sciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tromso and University Hospital of North Norway, Tromso, Norway.', ""Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics']",PMC6346238,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1917 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Jan;8(1):311-324. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1917.

Using the Mayo Clinic CLL database, we identified patients seen between March 1, 2002 and September 30, 2016 who had FISH testing performed within 3 years of CLL diagnosis. The prognostic profile, time to first therapy (TTT), and overall survival (OS) of patients with IGH-BCL2 and IGH-BCL3 translocation were compared to patients without these abnormalities (non-IGH group). Of 1684 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 38 (2.2%) had IGH-BCL2, and 16 (0.9%) had IGH-BCL3 translocation at diagnosis. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocation were more likely to have high and very-high CLL-International Prognostic Index, compared to patients with IGH-BCL2 translocation and the non-IGH group. The 5-year probability of requiring therapy was significantly higher for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (84% vs 33% vs 29%, respectively, P < 0.0001). The 5-year OS was significantly shorter for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (45% vs 89% vs 86%, respectively, P < 0.0001). On multivariable analyses, IGH-BCL3 translocation was associated with a shorter TTT (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7; P = 0.005) and shorter OS (HR = 5.5; P < 0.0001); IGH-BCL2 translocation did not impact TTT and OS. In conclusion, approximately 3% of all newly diagnosed CLL patients have either an IGH-BCL2 or IGH-BCL3 translocation. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocations have a distinct prognostic profile and outcome. These results support the inclusion of an IGH probe during the routine evaluation of FISH abnormalities in newly diagnosed CLL.","['Fang, Hong', 'Reichard, Kaaren K', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Ding, Wei', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Smoley, Stephanie A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Van Dyke, Daniel L', 'Parikh, Sameer A']","['Fang H', 'Reichard KK', 'Rabe KG', 'Hanson CA', 'Call TG', 'Ding W', 'Kenderian SS', 'Muchtar E', 'Schwager SM', 'Leis JF', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Slager SL', 'Braggio E', 'Smoley SA', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Van Dyke DL', 'Parikh SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1780-5959', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7313-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9811-4601']","['Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA197120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA 81534/NIH Clinical Center/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein/*genetics/immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/immunology', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/immunology', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6625355,['NIHMS1028169'],2018/12/24 06:00,2019/12/27 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25385 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Mar;94(3):338-345. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25385.

However, the effect of miRNA-200b on the development and progression of T-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the impact of miR-200b in T-ALL cell proliferation, survival and invasion using gain and loss of function approaches. Human Jurkat cells, a widely used in-vitro T-ALL cell model, were transfected with miR-200b mimic or miR-200b inhibitor. miR-200b mimics substantially inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation and invasion while significantly stimulating cell apoptosis compared to the control miRNA-treated cells. In contrast, Jurkat cells treated with anti-miR200 demonstrated induction of cell growth and invasion but repression of cell apoptosis. Such effect was accompanied by the corresponding alteration in NOTCH1 expression, suggesting that NOTCH1 might be the target gene for miR-200b function in Jurkat cells. In summary, our findings demonstrate that miR-200b may serve as a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL by negatively regulating the NOTCH1 signaling pathway.","['Ning, F', 'Zhou, Q', 'Chen, X']","['Ning F', 'Zhou Q', 'Chen X']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,['Letter'],Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (MIRN200 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/06/15 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['16 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2018 Nov-Dec;32(6):1467-1471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thioguanine, a generic drug initially developed for leukemia, has been explored and relicensed as a certified treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The patients' perception of this treatment has not been evaluated before. In this study, we aimed to assess self-reported experiences with thioguanine for IBD. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent out to members of the Dutch National Crohn's and Colitis patient organization. The Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire (SATMED-Q) was used to address questions regarding the satisfaction and impact of thioguanine therapy on the disease and their daily life. Furthermore, data on demographics, disease and (historical) treatment characteristics were collected. Open-ended questions were used for additional comments to the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 173 organization members (73% female) reported to be previous or current users of thioguanine. A total of 74% were satisfied with the effectiveness of thioguanine, whereas 5% were not. Eighty percent of the respondents were satisfied with the quality of care. A good or excellent impact on daily life was reported by 54%. A neutral or bad impact on daily life was reported by 40% and 6%, respectively. Improvement of disease activity was reported by 58%. This remained stable or worsened in 39% and 3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this self-report survey, among thioguanine treated patients with IBD who had failed with traditional therapies, 80% reported satisfaction with medical care and 74% with the effectiveness of the therapy. In the evaluation of new or rediscovered therapies, patient-reported outcomes and experiences should be considered as a key instrument.","['Simsek, Melek', 'Markus-de Kwaadsteniet, Tineke M L', 'van der Horst, Danielle', 'Mulder, Chris J J', 'de Boer, Nanne K H']","['Simsek M', 'Markus-de Kwaadsteniet TML', 'van der Horst D', 'Mulder CJJ', 'de Boer NKH']",,"['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, AG and M Research Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.simsek@vumc.nl.', ""Dutch Crohn's and Colitis organization (CCUVN), Woerden, The Netherlands."", ""Dutch Crohn's and Colitis organization (CCUVN), Woerden, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, AG and M Research Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, AG and M Research Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Romania,J Gastrointestin Liver Dis,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,101272825,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Generic)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Crohn Disease/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', '*Drug Approval', 'Drugs, Generic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Patient Safety', '*Patient Satisfaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['8 [pii]', '10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.274.tor [doi]']",ppublish,J Gastrointestin Liver Dis. 2018 Dec;27(4):385-389. doi: 10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.274.tor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As already demonstrated in CML, BMI1 is responsible for the resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in a BCR-ABL1-independent way. Even if, it is unknown where BMI1 in CML is expressed (in progenitors or more mature cells). We decided, therefore, to evaluate if and where the BMI1 protein is located, focusing mainly on the CD34+/CD38-/CD26+ CML progenitors. To begin we measured, by flow cytometry, the proportion of CD34+/CD26+ cells in 31 bone marrow samples from 20 CML patients, at diagnosis and during treatment with imatinib. After that the bone marrow blood smears were stained with antibodies anti-CD26, BCR-ABL1, and BMI1. These smears were observed by a confocal laser microscope and a 3D reconstruction was then performed. At diagnosis, CD34+/CD26+ cells median value/muL was 0.48; this number increased from diagnosis to the third month of therapy and then reduced during treatment with imatinib. The number and behavior of the CD26+ progenitors were independent from the BCR-ABL1 expression, but they summed up what previously observed about the BMI1 expression modulation. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that in CML the BMI1 protein is co-expressed with BCR-ABL1 only in the cytoplasm of the CD26+ precursors; on the contrary, in other hematological malignancies where BMI1 is commonly expressed (follicular lymphoma, essential thrombocytemia, acute myeloid leukemia), it was not co-localized with CD26 or, obviously, with BCR-ABL1. Once translated into the clinical context, if BMI1 is a marker of stemness, our results would suggest the combination of the BMI1 inhibitors with TKIs as an interesting object of research, and, probably, as a promising way to overcome resistance in CML patients.","['Galimberti, Sara', 'Grassi, Susanna', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Perutelli, Francesca', 'Ricci, Federica', 'Del Genio, Giada', 'Montali, Marina', 'Barachini, Serena', 'Giuliani, Cecilia', 'Ferreri, Maria Immacolata', 'Valetto, Angelo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Ippolito, Chiara', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Iovino, Lorenzo', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Salehzadeh, Serena', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Di Paolo, Antonello', 'Mattii, Letizia']","['Galimberti S', 'Grassi S', 'Barate C', 'Guerrini F', 'Ciabatti E', 'Perutelli F', 'Ricci F', 'Del Genio G', 'Montali M', 'Barachini S', 'Giuliani C', 'Ferreri MI', 'Valetto A', 'Abruzzese E', 'Ippolito C', 'Iurlo A', 'Bocchia M', 'Sicuranza A', 'Martino B', 'Iovino L', 'Buda G', 'Salehzadeh S', 'Petrini M', 'Di Paolo A', 'Mattii L']",,"['Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'GeNOMEC School of Doctorate, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Cytogenetics, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Cytogenetics, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Cytogenetics, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Cytogenetics, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Ematologia, Ospedale S.

We showed previously that B7-H1 could be widely induced on various types of cells and, in addition to be a ligand for PD-1 on T-cells, also serve as an anti-apoptotic receptor upon interacting with PD-1. We explored the role of B7-H1 as a receptor in protecting allogeneic T-cell mediated host cell destruction and systemic inflammation using mouse models of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Administer of by PD-1Ig or a B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) led to accelerated progression and rapid death in mice transferred with wild type allogeneic T-cells, supporting a dominant role of this pathway in the suppression of allogeneic T-cell response. In sharp contrast, PD-1Ig or B7-H1 mAb could behave as the B7-H1 agonists and drastically ameliorate the progression of GVHD and induced long-term tolerance in the context of transferring PD-1 deficient allogeneic T-cells. We further demonstrated that B7-H1 agonists decreased susceptibility of normal hematopoietic cells to allogenic T-cell lysis in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, mice that developed tolerance could still mount graft-versus-leukemia response. Our findings indicate a role for intrinsic B7-H1 in protecting host cells during systemic inflammation and have implications for treating human diseases including GVHD.","['Yu, Weiwei', 'Chen, Ling', 'Guo, Sizheng', 'Luo, Liqun', 'Chen, Lieping']","['Yu W', 'Chen L', 'Guo S', 'Luo L', 'Chen L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5230-8515', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6825-3069']","[""Laboratory of Immunotherapy, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou, GD, People's Republic Of China."", ""Institute of Immunotherapy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, FJ, People's Republic Of China."", ""Laboratory of Immunotherapy, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou, GD, People's Republic Of China."", ""Institute of Immunotherapy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, FJ, People's Republic Of China."", ""Laboratory of Immunotherapy, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou, GD, People's Republic Of China."", ""Institute of Immunotherapy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, FJ, People's Republic Of China."", ""Laboratory of Immunotherapy, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou, GD, People's Republic Of China."", ""Institute of Immunotherapy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, FJ, People's Republic Of China."", ""Laboratory of Immunotherapy, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou, GD, People's Republic Of China."", ""Institute of Immunotherapy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, FJ, People's Republic Of China."", 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC6298416,,2018/12/24 06:00,2018/12/24 06:01,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1504156 [doi]', '1504156 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Aug 6;7(11):e1504156. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1504156. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B7-H1', '*PD-1', '*cytolytic T-cells', '*graft versus host diseases']",,,20180806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identify a new approach to prevent GVHD that impairs monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) alloactivation of T cells, yet preserves graft- vs.-leukemia (GVL). Exceeding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) capacity results in a spliced form of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1s). XBP-1s mediates ER stress and inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that siRNA targeting XBP-1 in moDCs abrogates their stimulation of allogeneic T cells. B-I09, an inositol-requiring enzyme-1alpha (IRE1alpha) inhibitor that prevents XBP-1 splicing, reduces human moDC migration, allo-stimulatory potency, and curtails moDC IL-1beta, TGFbeta, and p40 cytokines, suppressing Th1 and Th17 cell priming. B-I09-treated moDCs reduce responder T cell activation via calcium flux without interfering with regulatory T cell (Treg) function or GVL effects by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells. In a human T cell mediated xenogeneic GVHD model, B-I09 inhibition of XBP-1s reduced target-organ damage and pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells without impacting donor Tregs or anti-tumor CTL.

It plays a vital role in tumor progression and has been accepted as one of the inhibitory B7 family checkpoint molecules. To identify the functions and underlying mechanisms of B7-H3 in multiple myeloma, we analyzed B7-H3 expression in myeloma patients and used siRNAs and overexpression plasmid of B7-H3 to investigate its roles and downstream signaling molecules in myeloma cell lines. The results showed that surface expression of B7-H3 was upregulated in myeloma samples and cell lines. Lower expression of B7-H3 in myeloma cells was associated with better progression-free survival. Myeloma cell survival, drug resistance, and tumor growth could be promoted by B7-H3. The molecular basis for these functional roles of B7-H3 involved the activation of JAK2/STAT3 via redox-mediated oxidation and activation of Src. We further identified a STAT3-promoting signaling pathway by which oxidant-mediated Src phosphorylation led to secondary activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Activated c-Cbl subsequently caused specific proteasomal degradation of SOCS3, a negative regulator of JAK2/STAT3. These data indicate B7-H3's important role in the activation of ROS/Src/c-Cbl pathway in multiple myeloma which integrates redox regulation and sustained STAT3 activation at the level of degradation of STAT3 suppressor.","['Lin, Liang', 'Cao, Li', 'Liu, Yang', 'Wang, Ke', 'Zhang, Xinwei', 'Qin, Xiaodan', 'Zhao, Dandan', 'Hao, Jie', 'Chang, Yingjun', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Liu, Bei', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Lu, Jin', 'Ge, Qing']","['Lin L', 'Cao L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang K', 'Zhang X', 'Qin X', 'Zhao D', 'Hao J', 'Chang Y', 'Huang X', 'Liu B', 'Zhang J', 'Lu J', 'Ge Q']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-6643'],"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, People's Hospital, 100044, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', ""Jining No.1 People's Hospital, 6 Jiankang Road, 272011, Jining, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, People's Hospital, 100044, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, People's Hospital, 100044, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29466, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, People's Hospital, 100044, Beijing, China. jin1lu@sina.com."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China. qingge@bjmu.edu.cn.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China. qingge@bjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD276 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', '*Apoptosis', 'B7 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0331-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0331-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1475-1486. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0331-6.

Relapse, treatment failure and organ infiltration worsen the prognosis, warranting a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. Cortactin is an actin-binding protein involved in cell adhesion and migration that is overexpressed in many solid tumors and in adult B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we investigated cortactin expression and potential impact on infiltration and disease prognosis in childhood B-ALL. B-ALL cell lines and precursor cells from bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of B-ALL patients indeed overexpressed cortactin. In CXCL12-induced transendothelial migration assays, transmigrated B-ALL cells had highest cortactin expression. In xenotransplantation models, only cortactin(high)-leukemic cells infiltrated lungs, brain, and testis; and they colonized more easily hypoxic BM organoids. Importantly, cortactin-depleted B-ALL cells were significantly less efficient in transendothelial migration, organ infiltration and BM colonization. Clinical data highlighted a significant correlation between high cortactin levels and BM relapse in drug-resistant high-risk B-ALL patients. Our results emphasize the importance of cortactin in B-ALL organ infiltration and BM relapse and its potential as diagnostic tool to identify high-risk patients and optimize their treatments.","['Velazquez-Avila, Martha', 'Balandran, Juan Carlos', 'Ramirez-Ramirez, Dalia', 'Velazquez-Avila, Mirella', 'Sandoval, Antonio', 'Felipe-Lopez, Alfonso', 'Nava, Porfirio',

The presumed genetic targets of many regions of aUPD remain unknown. Here we describe the association of chromosome 22 aUPD with mutations that delete the C-terminus of PRR14L in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), related myeloid neoplasms and age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). Myeloid panel analysis identified a median of three additional mutated genes (range 1-6) in cases with a myeloid neoplasm (n = 8), but no additional mutations in cases with ARCH (n = 2) suggesting that mutated PRR14L alone may be sufficient to drive clonality. PRR14L has very limited homology to other proteins and its function is unknown. ShRNA knockdown of PRR14L in human CD34+ cells followed by in vitro growth and differentiation assays showed an increase in monocytes and decrease in neutrophils, consistent with a CMML-like phenotype. RNA-Seq and cellular localization studies suggest a role for PRR14L in cell division. PRR14L is thus a novel, biallelically mutated gene and potential founding abnormality in myeloid neoplasms.","['Chase, Andrew', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Singh, Shalini', 'Score, Joannah', 'Tapper, William J', 'Lin, Feng', 'Hoade, Yvette', 'Bryant, Catherine', 'Trim, Nicola', 'Yip, Bon Ham', 'Zoi, Katerina', 'Rasi, Chiara', 'Forsberg, Lars A', 'Dumanski, Jan P', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Chase A', 'Pellagatti A', 'Singh S', 'Score J', 'Tapper WJ', 'Lin F', 'Hoade Y', 'Bryant C', 'Trim N', 'Yip BH', 'Zoi K', 'Rasi C', 'Forsberg LA', 'Dumanski JP', 'Boultwood J', 'Cross NCP']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Bloodwise Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Bloodwise Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Bloodwise Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Haematology Research Laboratory, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Beijer Laboratory of Genome Research, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Bloodwise Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (PRR14 protein, human)']",,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Uniparental Disomy', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC6451636,['EMS79910'],2018/12/24 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0340-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0340-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 May;33(5):1184-1194. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0340-5.

We identified STAT5B N642H, an established oncogenic mutation, in 27/1715 (1.6%) cases referred for investigation of eosinophilia. Of the 27 mutated cases, a working diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES; n = 7) or a myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia (n = 20) had been made prior to the detection of STAT5B N642H. Myeloid panel analysis identified a median of 2 additional mutated genes (range 0-4) with 4 cases having STAT5B N642H as a sole abnormality. STAT5B N642H was absent in cultured T cells of 4/4 positive cases.

The finding of STAT5B N642H as a recurrent mutation in myeloid neoplasia with eosinophilia provides a new diagnostic and prognostic marker as well as a potential target for therapy.","['Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hoade, Yvette', 'Tapper, William J', 'Carreno-Tarragona, Gonzalo', 'Fanelli, Tiziana', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Pieniak, Iwo', 'Lubke, Johannes', 'Ali, Sahra', 'Bhuller, Kaljit', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Cargo, Catherine', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Duncombe, Andrew S', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Evans, Paul', 'Forsyth, Peter', 'George, Philip', 'Grimley, Charlotte', 'Jack, Fergus', 'Munro, Laura', 'Mehra, Varun', 'Patel, Kavita', 'Rismani, Ali', 'Sciuccati, Gabriela', 'Thomas-Dewing, Rowena', 'Thornton, Patrick', 'Virchis, Andres', 'Watt, Simon', 'Wallis, Louise', 'Whiteway, Alastair', 'Zegocki, Kris', 'Bain, Barbara J', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Chase, Andrew']","['Cross NCP', 'Hoade Y', 'Tapper WJ', 'Carreno-Tarragona G', 'Fanelli T', 'Jawhar M', 'Naumann N', 'Pieniak I', 'Lubke J', 'Ali S', 'Bhuller K', 'Burgstaller S', 'Cargo C', 'Cavenagh J', 'Duncombe AS', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Evans P', 'Forsyth P', 'George P', 'Grimley C', 'Jack F', 'Munro L', 'Mehra V', 'Patel K', 'Rismani A', 'Sciuccati G', 'Thomas-Dewing R', 'Thornton P', 'Virchis A', 'Watt S', 'Wallis L', 'Whiteway A', 'Zegocki K', 'Bain BJ', 'Reiter A', 'Chase A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5481-2555'],"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, UK.', 'Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, AOU Careggi, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Hull & East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull, UK.', 'University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UK.', 'Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', ""HMDS, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK."", 'University Hospitals Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', ""HMDS, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", 'Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, UK.', 'Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', 'Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', 'Poole Hospital NHS Trust, Poole, UK.', 'York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, York, UK.', ""King's College Hospital, London, UK."", 'Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Wakefield, UK.', 'Whittington Health & University College London Hospitals, London, UK.', 'Hospital de Pediatria ""Prof. Dr. Garrahan"", Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Salford Royal Hospital, Salford, UK.', 'Beaumont and Connolly Hospitals, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Royal Free London, Barnet Hospital, Wellhouse Lane, Barnet, UK.', 'Manchester University NHS FT, Manchester, UK.', 'Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK.', 'Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, UK.', ""St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK."", 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Eosinophilia/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC6365490,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0342-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0342-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):415-425. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0342-3.

One such marker is serum free light chain (sFLC) analysis, which was first incorporated into the definition of stringent complete response in 2006. However, over the past decade there has been some reluctance to extend the role of the sFLC assays to replace 24 h urine electrophoresis for monitoring multiple myeloma (MM).

Data from EBMT on 6434 adults, who received a first alloHCT from January 2000 to December 2012, were retrospectively studied using combined land-marking, relative-survival methods and multi-state modeling techniques. Median age at alloHCT increased from 49 to 58 years, and the number of patients aged >/=65 years at alloHCT increased from 5 to 17%. Overall survival probability was 53% at 2 years and 35% at 10 years post-alloHCT. Survival probability at 5 years from the 2-year landmark was 88% for patients <45-year old and 63% for patients >/=65-year old at alloHCT. Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for patients <45-year old at transplant was 7% rising to 25% for patients aged >/=65. For older patients, 31% of NRM-deaths could be attributed to population mortality. Favorable post-alloHCT long-term survival was seen; however, excess mortality-risk for all age groups was shown compared to the general population. A substantial part of total NRM for older patients was attributable to population mortality, information which aids the balanced explanation of post-HCT risk and helps improve long-term care.","['Schetelig, Johannes', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Koster, Linda', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Mufti, G J', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heidenreich, Silke', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Robin, Marie', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Schetelig J', 'de Wreede LC', 'van Gelder M', 'Koster L', 'Finke J', 'Niederwieser D', 'Beelen D', 'Mufti GJ', 'Platzbecker U', 'Ganser A', 'Heidenreich S', 'Maertens J', 'Socie G', 'Brecht A', 'Stelljes M', 'Kobbe G', 'Volin L', 'Nagler A', 'Vitek A', 'Luft T', 'Ljungman P', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Robin M', 'Kroger N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4737-1103'],"['Universitaetsklinikum Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and compared with that of age and sex-matched controls from the general population. Symptom burden was assessed with the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) questionnaire and comorbidity profile was also investigated. Median follow-up time since diagnosis was 14.3 years (interquartile range: 11.1-16.9 years). APL survivors had a statistically and clinically meaningful worse score for the role physical scale of the SF-36 (-9.5; 95% CI, -15.7 to -3.2, P = 0.003) than their peers in the general population. Fatigue was reported as moderate to severe by 29% of patients and 84.4% reported at least one comorbidity. Prevalence of comorbidity in APL survivors was higher than that reported by the general population. Also, marked variations were found in the HRQOL profile by number of comorbidities. Even many years after treatment ends, APL survivors treated with standard chemotherapy do not fully recover as they report HRQOL limitations and a substantial burden of symptoms.","['Efficace, Fabio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Cottone, Francesco', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Romani, Claudio', 'Sborgia, Marco', ""D'Ardia, Stefano"", 'Nobile, Francesco', 'Cantore, Nicola', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Lo Coco, Francesco']","['Efficace F', 'Breccia M', 'Avvisati G', 'Cottone F', 'Intermesoli T', 'Borlenghi E', 'Carluccio P', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Fabbiano F', 'Luppi M', 'Romani C', 'Sborgia M', ""D'Ardia S"", 'Nobile F', 'Cantore N', 'Crugnola M', 'Nadali G', 'Vignetti M', 'Amadori S', 'Lo Coco F']",,"['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy.', 'Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy.', 'University of Milan, Hematology and BMT Unit, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (DETO), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Project Foundation, Department of Hematology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences Section of Hematology Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'U.O.

However, the disease distribution is often heterogeneous, and imaging can be used to complement MRD detection at a single site. We have investigated patients in complete remission (CR) during first-line or salvage therapy for whom MRD flow cytometry and the two imaging modalities positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) were performed at the onset of CR. Residual focal lesions (FLs), detectable in 24% of first-line patients, were associated with short progression-free survival (PFS), with DW-MRI detecting disease in more patients. In some patients, FLs were only PET positive, indicating that the two approaches are complementary. Combining MRD and imaging improved prediction of outcome, with double-negative and double-positive features defining groups with excellent and dismal PFS, respectively. FLs were a rare event (12%) in first-line MRD-negative CR patients. In contrast, patients achieving an MRD-negative CR during salvage therapy frequently had FLs (50%). Multi-region sequencing and imaging in an MRD-negative patient showed persistence of spatially separated clones.

In addition to its direct impact on tumor cells, PI3Kdelta inhibition can modulate the activity of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) resulting in enhanced anti-tumoral immune functions which may contribute to the success of PI3Kdelta inhibitors in cancer therapy. The role of Tregs in CLL and their modulation by PI3Kdelta inhibitors was so far poorly understood. Using the Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer model of CLL, we show that disease development induces the accumulation of activated and highly immunosuppressive Tregs. Depletion of CD25(+) Tregs using anti-CD25 antibodies resulted in enhanced CD8(+) T-cell activation, effector differentiation, and functional capacity. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kdelta effectively controlled disease and significantly decreased both CD25(+) and CD25(-) Treg numbers, proliferation and activation status in CLL-bearing mice. Nonetheless, this PI3Kdelta-mediated decrease in Tregs did not translate into better CD8(+) T-cell function, as PI3Kdelta inhibition concomitantly abrogated T-cell receptor signaling in CD8(+) T-cells leading to decreased activation, effector cell differentiation and proliferation. Collectively, these data highlight the strong immunomodulatory effects of PI3Kdelta inhibitors in CLL and are of relevance for a rational design of idelalisib-based combination therapies in CLL.","['Hanna, Bola S', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Scheffold, Annika', 'Jebaraj, Billy M C', 'Demerdash, Yasmin', 'Ozturk, Selcen', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Hanna BS', 'Roessner PM', 'Scheffold A', 'Jebaraj BMC', 'Demerdash Y', 'Ozturk S', 'Lichter P', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Seiffert M']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. b.hanna@dkfz.de.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. m.seiffert@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 subunit, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0318-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0318-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1427-1438. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0318-3.

The mutations associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes affect fundamental cellular pathways, such as DNA repair, telomere maintenance, or proteostasis. How these disturbed pathways fail to produce sufficient blood cells and lead to leukemogenesis are not understood. The rarity of inherited cytopenias, the paucity of affected primary human hematopoietic cells, and the sometime inadequacy of murine or induced pluripotential stem cell models mean it is difficult to acquire a greater understanding of them. Zebrafish offer a model organism to study gene functions. As vertebrates, zebrafish share with humans many orthologous genes involved in blood disorders. As a model organism, zebrafish provide advantages that include rapid development of transparent embryos, high fecundity (providing large numbers of mutant and normal siblings), and a large collection of mutant and transgenic lines useful for investigating the blood system and other tissues during development. Importantly, recent advances in genomic editing in zebrafish can speedily validate the new genes or novel variants discovered in clinical investigation as causes for marrow failure. Here we review zebrafish as a model organism that phenocopies Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and severe congenital neutropenia. Two important insights, provided by modeling inherited cytopenias in zebrafish, widen understanding of ribosome biogenesis and TP53 in mediating marrow failure and non-hematologic defects. They suggest that TP53-independent pathways contribute to marrow failure. In addition, zebrafish provide an attractive model organism for drug development.","['Oyarbide, Usua', 'Topczewski, Jacek', 'Corey, Seth J']","['Oyarbide U', 'Topczewski J', 'Corey SJ']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Richmond and Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Richmond and Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA coreys2@ccf.org."", 'Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL128173/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA159203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tp53 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Failure Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', '*Zebrafish/genetics/metabolism', '*Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6312012,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.196105 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.196105 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jan;104(1):13-24. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.196105.

The European LeukemiaNet distinguishes -7/del(7q) abnormalities as a ""warning"". However, the impact of clonal chromosome abnormalities, and specifically those of -7/del(7q), in Philadelphia-negative cells on clinical outcomes is unclear and based on case-reports showing morphological dysplasia and increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting the coexistence of chronic myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine whether the impact of -7/del(7q) clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells on the clinical outcome is different from that of other types of abnormalities, and we argue for an underlying associated high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Among 102 chronic myeloid leukemia patients with clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells with more than a median of 6 years of follow up, patients with -7/del(7q) more frequently had signs of dysplasia, a lower cumulative incidence of deep molecular response and often needed further treatment lines, with the consequent impact on event-free and progression-free survival. Morphological features of dysplasia are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia mutations and compromise the optimal response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, irrespectively of the type of clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells. However, mutation patterns determined by next-generation sequencing could not clearly explain the underlying high-risk disease. We hereby confirm the pejorative prognostic value of -7/del(7q) clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells and suggest that myelodysplastic features constitute a warning signal that response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be less than optimal.","['Bidet, Audrey', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Smol, Thomas', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Morisset, Stephane', 'Coiteux, Valerie', 'Noel-Walter, Marie-Pierre', 'Nicolini, Franck-Emmanuel', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Gaillard, Baptiste', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Tondeur, Sylvie', 'Nadal, Nathalie', 'Hermet, Eric', 'Veronese, Lauren', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Gervais, Carine', 'Theisen, Olivier', 'Terre, Christine', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste', 'Radford, Isabelle', 'Vervaeke, Anne-Laure', 'Barin, Carole', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Mahon, Francois Xavier', 'Roche-Lestienne, Catherine']","['Bidet A', 'Dulucq S', 'Smol T', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Morisset S', 'Coiteux V', 'Noel-Walter MP', 'Nicolini FE', 'Tigaud I', 'Luquet I', 'Struski S', 'Gaillard B', 'Penther D', 'Tondeur S', 'Nadal N', 'Hermet E', 'Veronese L', 'Rea D', 'Gervais C', 'Theisen O', 'Terre C', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Lefebvre C', 'Gaillard JB', 'Radford I', 'Vervaeke AL', 'Barin C', 'Chapiro E', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Etienne G', 'Preudhomme C', 'Mahon FX', 'Roche-Lestienne C']",,"[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Bordeaux."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Bordeaux."", 'Institut de Genetique Medicale, Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, CHU Lille.', 'Centre de Recherche Jean-Pierre Aubert, UMR-S 1172, Universite de Lille.', ""Institut d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie Pathologie Genetique, CHU Lille."", 'Inserm, UMR-S 1172, Lille.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon."", 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHU Lille.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHU Lille.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon."", 'Inserm U1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon.', ""Laboratoire de Cytogenetique et de Biologie Moleculaire, Service d'Hematologie Biologique -

The observed hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.71 (95%CI: 0.41-1.21) and, after post hoc adjustment for performance status imbalance, 0.57 (95%CI: 0.337-0.983). The most frequent treatment-related adverse (grade >/=3) events with mogamulizumab were infusion-related reaction and thrombocytopenia (each 9%). Relapsed/refractory ATL is an aggressive, poor prognosis disease with a high unmet need. Investigator's choice chemotherapy did not result in tumor response in this trial; however, mogamulizumab treatment resulted in 11% cORR, with a tolerable safety profile.","['Phillips, Adrienne A', 'Fields, Paul A', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Ramos, Juan C', 'Beltran, Brady E', 'Pereira, Juliana', 'Wandroo, Farooq', 'Feldman, Tatyana', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Sawas, Ahmed', 'Humphrey, Jeffrey', 'Kurman, Michael', 'Moriya, Junji', 'Dwyer, Karen', 'Leoni, Mollie', 'Conlon, Kevin', 'Cook, Lucy', 'Gonsky, Jason', 'Horwitz, Steven M']","['Phillips AA', 'Fields PA', 'Hermine O', 'Ramos JC', 'Beltran BE', 'Pereira J', 'Wandroo F', 'Feldman T', 'Taylor GP', 'Sawas A', 'Humphrey J', 'Kurman M', 'Moriya J', 'Dwyer K', 'Leoni M', 'Conlon K', 'Cook L', 'Gonsky J', 'Horwitz SM']",,"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA adp9002@med.cornell.edu.', ""Department of Haematology Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Trust Hospital, London, UK."", 'Department of Hematology, Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, FL, USA.', 'Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins and Centro de Investigacion de Medicina de Precision, Universidad de San Martin de Porres, Lima, Peru.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, West Bromwich, and University of Birmingham, UK.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack UMC, NJ, USA.', ""National Centre for Human Retrovirology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Kyowa Kirin, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Kyowa Kirin, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Kyowa Kirin, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Kyowa Kirin, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Kyowa Kirin, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Haematology and National Centre for Human Retrovirology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, New York City Health + Hospitals/Kings County and SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminopterin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxaliplatin/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC6518882,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.205096 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.205096 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 May;104(5):993-1003. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.205096.

The replication of mitochondrial DNA is performed by the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. As acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and stem cells have an increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, we sought to evaluate polymerase gamma inhibitors in AML. The thymidine dideoxynucleoside analog, alovudine, is an inhibitor of polymerase gamma. In AML cells, alovudine depleted mitochondrial DNA, reduced mitochondrial encoded proteins, decreased basal oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation and viability. To evaluate the effects of polymerase gamma inhibition with alovudine in vivo, mice were xenografted with OCI-AML2 cells and then treated with alovudine. Systemic administration of alovudine reduced leukemic growth without evidence of toxicity and decreased levels of mitochondrial DNA in the leukemic cells. We also showed that alovudine increased the monocytic differentiation of AML cells. Genetic knockdown and other chemical inhibitors of polymerase gamma also promoted AML differentiation, but the effects on AML differentiation were independent of reductions in oxidative phosphorylation or respiratory chain proteins. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism by which mitochondria regulate AML fate and differentiation independent of oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we highlight polymerase gamma inhibitors, such as alovudine, as novel therapeutic agents for AML.","['Yehudai, Dana', 'Liyanage, Sanduni U', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Rizoska, Biljana', 'Albertella, Mark', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Jeyaraju, Danny V', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Barghout, Samir H', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Siriwardena, Thirushi P', 'Jitkova, Yulia', 'Targett-Adams, Paul', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Yehudai D', 'Liyanage SU', 'Hurren R', 'Rizoska B', 'Albertella M', 'Gronda M', 'Jeyaraju DV', 'Wang X', 'Barghout SH', 'MacLean N', 'Siriwardena TP', 'Jitkova Y', 'Targett-Adams P', 'Schimmer AD']",,"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Medivir AB, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Medivir AB, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, ON, Canada aaron.schimmer@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase gamma)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (POLG protein, human)', 'PG53R0DWDQ (alovudine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Polymerase gamma/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dideoxynucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/*drug effects', 'Thymidine/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6518883,,2018/12/24 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.195172 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.195172 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 May;104(5):963-972. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.195172.

The untranslocated MLL1 is a substrate for proteolytic cleavage by the endopeptidase threonine aspartase 1 (taspase1); however, the biological significance of MLL1 cleavage by this endopeptidase remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that taspase1-dependent cleavage of MLL1 results in the destabilization of MLL. Upon loss of taspase1, MLL1 association with chromatin is markedly increased due to the stabilization of its unprocessed version, and this stabilization of the uncleaved MLL1 can result in the displacement of MLL chimeras from chromatin in leukemic cells. Casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates MLL1 proximal to the taspase1 cleavage site, facilitating its cleavage, and pharmacological inhibition of CKII blocks taspase1-dependent MLL1 processing, increases MLL1 stability, and results in the displacement of the MLL chimeras from chromatin. Accordingly, inhibition of CKII in a MLL-AF9 mouse model of leukemia delayed leukemic progression in vivo. This study provides insights into the direct regulation of the stability of MLL1 through its cleavage by taspase1, which can be harnessed for targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of aggressive leukemia as the result of MLL translocations.","['Zhao, Zibo', 'Wang, Lu', 'Volk, Andrew G', 'Birch, Noah W', 'Stoltz, Kristen L', 'Bartom, Elizabeth T', 'Marshall, Stacy A', 'Rendleman, Emily J', 'Nestler, Carson M', 'Shilati, Joseph', 'Schiltz, Gary E', 'Crispino, John D', 'Shilatifard, Ali']","['Zhao Z', 'Wang L', 'Volk AG', 'Birch NW', 'Stoltz KL', 'Bartom ET', 'Marshall SA', 'Rendleman EJ', 'Nestler CM', 'Shilati J', 'Schiltz GE', 'Crispino JD', 'Shilatifard A']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.', 'Robert H.

Among mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are pluripotent but heterogenous in gene expression and morphology, an ESC population cultured in small molecule inhibitors of two kinases, MAPK/ERK kinase (Mek) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3), and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) (2i/L) is considered to be naive pluripotent with uniform pluripotent machinery operation. Though the gene regulatory mechanism for the naive pluripotency has been investigated in recent years, it is still not fully elucidated. Here we show a novel signaling involved in the maintenance of naive pluripotency. An AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamied-1-beta-riboside) blocked the differentiation of mouse naive ESCs in the absence of 2i/L and maintained the naive state. AICAR with Lif condition induced an almost comparable level of naive pluripotent gene expression in mouse ESCs. Another AMPK activator, A769662, also showed similar effects. A p38 inhibitor, SB203580, blocked the AMPK activation-elicited naive state maintenance. On the other hand, p38 activation partially mimicked the maintenance effects of AMPK activators, suggesting that p38 is one of the functional downstream molecules to conduct the AMPK effects. Thus, AMPK pathway should be involved in the molecular circuitry of naive pluripotency in mouse ESCs. These findings would be a valuable clue to further elucidate the molecular machinery of naive pluripotency.","['Liu, Yajing', 'Yamashita, Jun K']","['Liu Y', 'Yamashita JK']",,"['The Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'The Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.

However, few studies have examined the accuracy and precision of marrow blast counting using standard microscopic procedures. In our study, 4 experienced hematopathologists evaluated blast percentages in marrow using either differential counts on aspirate smears or visual estimates on CD34-stained trephine biopsies. Results of an independent observer's manual counts of individual labeled and unlabeled cells performed on high resolution digital images of CD34-stained trephine biopsies were designated as the ""Digital Reference."" Hematopathologists' blast counts showed excellent interobserver reproducibility, but the counts in smears and trephine biopsies correlated poorly with each other. Compared to the Digital Reference, both smear and trephine evaluations showed positive bias and high variability. The biopsy showed less variability but higher positive bias relative to the smears, indicating that counts were overestimated more in the hematopathologists' biopsy evaluation. Flow cytometric counts correlated well with the Digital Reference, and cases with high blast count generally showed worse cytogenetic findings. Our results demonstrate the need for better counting methods if significant decisions are made based on microscopic enumeration of blasts. Further efforts should be made to develop markers to better define blast cells and perhaps incorporate automated digital imaging technologies to enumerate them. Also, consideration should be given to quantifying blasts per marrow area in biopsies instead of per nucleated cells.","['Hodes, Aaron', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Dulau, Alina', 'Maric, Irina', 'Sun, Junfeng', 'Braylan, Raul']","['Hodes A', 'Calvo KR', 'Dulau A', 'Maric I', 'Sun J', 'Braylan R']",,"['Department of Radiology, Jacobi Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.

Instead, multiplex testing platforms that can test multiple targets in a specimen have been developed. Among these platforms, massively parallel sequencing technologies (so-called next-generation sequencing [NGS] [4]) prove to be most versatile and is increasingly being used to build tests to meet the clinical testing need.

Symptomatic bronchopulmonary sequestration is uncommon, seen more frequently in the pediatric population than in adults. It has traditionally been treated with surgical resection; however, a limited but growing number of cases have been treated with angiographic embolization. Given the inherent risks of cardiothoracic surgery, embolization of the anomalous vessel is an enticing alternative treatment. We present a case of a 56-year-old woman with known, symptomatic, intralobar pulmonary sequestration that was successfully treated with coil embolization. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Pacific Islander woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia was admitted to the hospital with an episode of hemoptysis. Computed tomography of the chest demonstrated left lower lobe intralobar pulmonary sequestration fed by a large tortuous vessel branching off of the descending thoracic aorta. Surgical resection of the sequestration is the current standard treatment strategy of symptomatic intralobar pulmonary sequestration. The cardiothoracic surgeon noted that given the size and location of arterial blood supply, intervention would involve thoracotomy and lobectomy. The interventional radiologist offered embolization of the lesion as an alternative to surgery. Multiple coils, 6-13 mm in size, were used to embolize the sequestration. No considerable flow distal to the coils was noted postembolization. CONCLUSIONS: Intralobar pulmonary sequestration is a rare condition that typically requires surgical management. This case demonstrates the efficacy of coil embolization as an alternative management strategy. To date, limited case reports of adults treated with endovascular embolization exist. Treatment of symptomatic pulmonary sequestration with embolization can be considered as an alternative to surgical resection.","['Ellis, John', 'Brahmbhatt, Sumir', 'Desmond, Daniel', 'Ching, Brian', 'Hostler, Jordanna']","['Ellis J', 'Brahmbhatt S', 'Desmond D', 'Ching B', 'Hostler J']",,"['Tripler Army Medical Center, 1 Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, HI, 96859, USA. john.s.ellis40.mil@mail.mil.', 'Tripler Army Medical Center, 1 Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, HI, 96859, USA.', 'Tripler Army Medical Center, 1 Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, HI, 96859, USA.', 'Tripler Army Medical Center, 1 Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, HI, 96859, USA.', 'Tripler Army Medical Center, 1 Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, HI, 96859, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['*Angiography', 'Bronchopulmonary Sequestration/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology/*therapy', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Hemoptysis/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6302303,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-018-1915-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-018-1915-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2018 Dec 21;12(1):375. doi: 10.1186/s13256-018-1915-5.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Coil Embolization', 'Intralobar', 'Pulmonary sequestration']",,,20181221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the cytotoxicity and inhibitory effect of curcumin on cell cycle of FLT3-ITD overexpressing MV4-11 leukemic cells were evaluated. Moreover, curcumin polymeric micelles conjugated with FLT3-specific peptide (FLT3-Cur-micelles) were prepared using a film hydration method to increase curcumin solubility and the inhibitory effect on MV4-11 cells was evaluated. Cytotoxicity and cell cycle analysis were performed using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Physical properties of FLT3-Cur-micelles, including particle size, size distribution, morphology, and entrapment efficiency (EE), were evaluated. Cellular uptake of the micelles on MV4-11 cells was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. FLT3-Cur-micelles were observed with size less than 50 nm and high EE of >75%. In addition, FLT3-Cur-micelles demonstrated excellent internalization and increased curcumin accumulation in leukemic cells when compared to free curcumin. Furthermore, FLT3-Cur-micelles exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect on MV4-11 cells with IC50 value of 1.1 microM, whereas the blank micelles showed no effect. Furthermore, FLT3-Cur-micelles showed no significant effect on normal human PBMCs with IC50 value >25 microM. In summary, FLT3-Cur-micelles are a promising nanocarrier system for enhancing anti-leukemic activity of curcumin and suitable for further preclinical studies.","['Tima, Singkome', 'Okonogi, Siriporn', 'Ampasavate, Chadarat', 'Berkland, Cory', 'Anuchapreeda, Songyot']","['Tima S', 'Okonogi S', 'Ampasavate C', 'Berkland C', 'Anuchapreeda S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9346-938X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7259-4694']","['a Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'd Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'e Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'b Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'd Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'b Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy , University of Kansas , Kansas , USA.', 'a Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'd Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'e Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences , Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Drug Dev Ind Pharm,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,7802620,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polymers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcuma/chemistry', 'Curcumin/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Micelles', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Solubility/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03639045.2018.1562462 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Dev Ind Pharm. 2019 Mar;45(3):498-505. doi: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1562462.

Recently, combining specific B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 inhibitors with compounds downregulating myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl)-1 has been proposed as a new effective strategy to eradicate resistant AML cells. We show here that 1(R), 6(S), 1'(R), 6'(S), 11(R), 17(S)-fistularin-3, a bromotyrosine compound of the fistularin family, isolated from the marine sponge Suberea clavata, synergizes with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to efficiently kill Mcl-1/Bcl-2-positive AML cell lines, associated with Mcl-1 downregulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress induction. The absolute configuration of carbons 11 and 17 of the fistularin-3 stereoisomer was fully resolved in this study for the first time, showing that the fistularin we isolated from the marine sponge Subarea clavata is in fact the (+)-11(R), 17(S)-fistularin-3 stereoisomer keeping the known configuration 1(R), 6(S), 1'(R), and 6'(S) for the verongidoic acid part. Docking studies and in vitro assays confirm the potential of this family of molecules to inhibit DNA methyltransferase 1 activity.","['Florean, Cristina', 'Kim, Kyung Rok', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Kim, Hyun-Jung', 'Moriou, Celine', 'Debitus, Cecile', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Al-Mourabit, Ali', 'Han, Byung Woo', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Florean C', 'Kim KR', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Kim HJ', 'Moriou C', 'Debitus C', 'Dicato M', 'Al-Mourabit A', 'Han BW', 'Diederich M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0550-9538', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7571-3791', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0115-4725']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. cristina.florean@lbmcc.lu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea. krkim85@snu.ac.kr.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. michael.schnekenburger@lbmcc.lu.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Korea. hyunjungkim@cau.ac.kr.', 'Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, CNRS UPR 2301, Univ.

Identifying the clinical characteristics of IL with facial paralysis as the initial symptom is necessary to improve the understanding of the causes of facial paralysis and IL. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 10-month-old infant had facial paralysis and recurrent fever. He was misdiagnosed as having bacterial meningitis for >2 months. DIAGNOSES: The infant was diagnosed as having acute monocytic leukemia (M5) with central infiltration based on examinations of the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid by flow cytometry. INTERVENTIONS: Before the diagnosis of leukemia, the patient was given meropenem, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin successively for anti-infective treatment for 2 months, and dexamethasone for several days. But he gave up further treatment after confirmed diagnosis. OUTCOMES: Our patient discontinued treatment and discharged. From literature review, there were 6 cases (including this case) of IL with facial paralysis as the initial symptom. 80% of patients were misdiagnosis and treated with a corticosteroid in the early stage, and the mortality was 33.3%. LESSONS: The clinical symptoms of IL with facial paralysis are not typical, with a high rate of misdiagnosis. When the cause of facial paralysis is unknown or the advance treatment effect is poor, tumor diseases should be considered. Corticosteroids should be carefully administered to children with facial paralysis.","['Wang, Liyuan', 'Wang, Zhiling', 'Wan, Chaomin', 'Cai, Xiaotang', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Lai, Chunqi']","['Wang L', 'Wang Z', 'Wan C', 'Cai X', 'Zhang G', 'Lai C']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric and Gynaecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric and Gynaecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric and Gynaecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric and Gynaecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Laboratory, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Facial Paralysis/*diagnosis/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Withholding Treatment']",PMC6320160,,2018/12/24 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/12/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000013673 [doi]', '00005792-201812210-00068 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Dec;97(51):e13673. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000013673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hepatic and cardiac overload in patients with MDS as measured by T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and its correlation with survival. METHODS: MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients had iron overload evaluated by T2* MRI. HIO was considered when hepatic iron concentration >/= 2 g/mg. Cardiac iron overload was considered with a T2*-value < 20 ms. RESULTS: Among 71 patients analyzed, median hepatic iron concentration was 3.9 g/mg (range 0.9-16 g/mg), and 68%of patients had hepatic iron overload. Patients with hepatic iron overload had higher mean ferritin levels (1182 ng/mL versus 185 ng/mL, p < 0.0001), transferrin saturation (76% versus 34%, p < 0.0001) and lower survival rates. Median cardiac T2*value was 42 ms (range 19.7-70.1 ms), and only one patienthad a T2* value indicative of cardiac iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic iron overload is found in two thirds of patients, even in cases without laboratory signs of iron overload. Hepatic iron overload by T2* MRI is associated with a decreased risk of survival in patients with MDS.","['Mantovani, L F', 'Santos, F P S', 'Perini, G F', 'Nascimento, C M B', 'Silva, L P', 'Wroclawski, C K', 'Esposito, B P', 'Ribeiro, M S S', 'Velloso, E D R P', 'Nomura, C H', 'Kay, F U', 'Baroni, R H', 'Hamerschlak, N', 'Schuster, S']","['Mantovani LF', 'Santos FPS', 'Perini GF', 'Nascimento CMB', 'Silva LP', 'Wroclawski CK', 'Esposito BP', 'Ribeiro MSS', 'Velloso EDRP', 'Nomura CH', 'Kay FU', 'Baroni RH', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Schuster S']",,"['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Oncology Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Oncology Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Hospital Sao Camilo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Sirio-Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Chemistry Institute, Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto Paulista de Cancerologia, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Discipline, Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto do Coracao, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo (FMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States.', 'Diagnostic Imaging Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Other carcinogenicity studies conducted on aspartame have shown no such carcinogenic potential in any organ system. Additional data to assess the carcinogenic potential of aspartame, especially in relation to the publications of the Ramazzini Institute, were obtained from a third-party histological evaluation of tissues from a carcinogenicity study previously conducted to assess the potential for aspartame to induce tumors of the brain. The results of this histological evaluation provide no evidence of a tumorigenic effect of aspartame in any organ group, including those organs/tissues reportedly affected in the Ramazzini Institute's studies. The only effects identified were an increased incidence of renal pelvic mineralization and renal pelvic hyperplasia secondary to the irritant properties of the mineralization process. The toxicological significance of these particular findings is widely considered minimal. There is no evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic in rats, at least to doses of 4g/kg body weight/day administered over a 2-year period.","['Shibui, Yusuke', 'Fujitani, Shoji', 'Iwata, Hijiri', 'Lynch, Barry', 'Roberts, Ashley']","['Shibui Y', 'Fujitani S', 'Iwata H', 'Lynch B', 'Roberts A']",,"['Institute for Innovation, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., 1-1, Suzuki-cho, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki-shi, 210-8681, Japan.', 'Institute for Innovation, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., 1-1, Suzuki-cho, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki-shi, 210-8681, Japan.', 'LunaPath LLC., 3-5-1, Aoihigashi, Naka-ku, Hamamatsu-shi, 433-8114, Japan.', 'Intertek Scientific & Regulatory Consultancy, 2233 Argentia Road, Suite 201, Mississauga, Ontario, L5N 2X7, Canada.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), AID was previously shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor. While there is substantial impact on DNA mutations, effects of AID on gene expression by promoter demethylation of disease related target genes in leukemia has not been addressed. To shed light on this question, we aimed at determining genome wide methylation changes as well as gene expression changes in response to AID expression in CLL. Although we found minor differences in individual methylation variable positions following AID expression, we could not find recurrent methylation changes of specific target sites or changes in global methylation.","['Schubert, Maria', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Gassner, Franz Josef', 'Greil, Richard', 'Geisberger, Roland']","['Schubert M', 'Hackl H', 'Gassner FJ', 'Greil R', 'Geisberger R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0131-2191'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Biocenter, Division of Bioinformatics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],['P 28201/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Computational Biology', 'DNA Methylation/physiology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Porphyria, Acute Intermittent/*metabolism']",PMC6301619,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0208753 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-22935 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Dec 20;13(12):e0208753. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0208753. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181220,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess atherosclerosis and underlying mechanisms in hypercholesterolemic mice with hematopoietic Jak2 (VF) expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Irradiated low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout ( Ldlr(-/-)) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type or Jak2 (VF) mice and fed a high-fat high-cholesterol Western diet. Hematopoietic functions and atherosclerosis were characterized. After 7 weeks of Western diet, Jak2 (VF) mice showed increased atherosclerosis. Early atherosclerotic lesions showed increased neutrophil adhesion and content, correlating with lesion size. After 12 weeks of Western diet, Jak2 (VF) lesions showed increased complexity, with larger necrotic cores, defective efferocytosis, prominent iron deposition, and costaining of erythrocytes and macrophages, suggesting erythrophagocytosis. Jak2 (VF) erythrocytes were more susceptible to phagocytosis by wild-type macrophages and showed decreased surface expression of CD47, a ""don't-eat-me"" signal. Human JAK2VF erythrocytes were also more susceptible to erythrophagocytosis. Jak2 (VF) macrophages displayed increased expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prominent inflammasome activation, increased p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, and reduced levels of MerTK (c-Mer tyrosine kinase), a key molecule mediating efferocytosis. Increased erythrophagocytosis also suppressed efferocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic Jak2 (VF) expression promotes early lesion formation and increased complexity in advanced atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hematopoiesis and neutrophil infiltration in early lesions, Jak2 (VF) caused cellular defects in erythrocytes and macrophages, leading to increased erythrophagocytosis but defective efferocytosis. These changes promote accumulation of iron in plaques and increased necrotic core formation which, together with exacerbated proinflammatory responses, likely contribute to plaque instability.","['Wang, Wei', 'Liu, Wenli', 'Fidler, Trevor', 'Wang, Ying', 'Tang, Yang', 'Woods, Brittany', 'Welch, Carrie', 'Cai, Bishuang', 'Silvestre-Roig, Carlos', 'Ai, Ding', 'Yang, Yong-Guang',

30571036,,Publisher,,,,,,2022 Jan,Childhood Brain Tumors,,,"Pediatric brain tumors are the most common type of solid childhood cancer and only second to leukemia as a cause of pediatric malignancies. They are classified into supra and infratentorial tumors. They could also be classified according to the age of diagnosis into congenital brain tumors (CBT) (diagnosed antenatally in the first 60 days of life), tumors of the infancy (younger than 1 year of age), and older children. The prognosis of pediatric brain tumors depends on the age at presentation, histological type, and extent of resection. CBT behaves in different ways than pathologically similar tumors in older children. For example, high-grade gliomas exhibit sightly better prognosis in very young children compared to their older counterparts.[1][2] With the advances in imaging techniques, molecular biology, and genetics, pediatric brain tumors are increasingly being diagnosed early in the disease course, sub-grouped, and treated with more targeted strategies.[3] Among all childhood cancers, brain tumors are the leading cause of death. This article highlights the congenital group with an emphasis on the most common types in this category, specifically; teratoma, choroid plexus papilloma, desmoplastic infantile tumors (DIA/DIG), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and medulloblastoma.","['Subramanian, Surabhi', 'Ahmad, Tahani']","['Subramanian S', 'Ahmad T']",,,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2018/12/21 06:01,2018/12/21 06:01,,,['NBK535415 [bookaccession]'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20181221,['20210812'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/12/21 06:01'],

Folate has been added to grains in the United States to prevent congenital disabilities, especially neural tube defects, as it is necessary for the formation of several coenzymes in many metabolic systems, particularly for purine and pyrimidine synthesis, nucleoprotein synthesis, and maintenance in erythropoiesis.[1] Folate like vitamin B12 is a provider of 1-carbon residues for DNA and RNA synthesis. The potent form of folic acid is tetrahydrofolate. Some of the latest research reveals the following about folic acid deficiency: 1. There may be a link between elevated homocysteine (a marker for an increased risk for arteriosclerosis) and folate deficiency. 2. A lowering of the risk of stroke but not adverse cardiac event when hyperhomocysteinemia is corrected with folic acid. 3. Reduction in the incidence of neural tube defects with folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. 4. Lack of folic acid during pregnancy may increase the risk of diabetes-associated congenital disabilities and autism. 5. Maternal folic acid during pregnancy may lower the risk of childhood leukemia. 6. Folic acid supplementation may increase the risk of cancer.","['Khan, Kashif M.', 'Jialal, Ishwarlal']","['Khan KM', 'Jialal I']",,,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2018/12/21 06:01,2018/12/21 06:01,,,['NBK535377 [bookaccession]'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20181221,['20210928'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/12/21 06:01'],

One of the most common cattle infection is bovine leukemia (causative agent - BLV), which often occurs in conjunction with a closely related infection -bovine immunodeficiency (causative agent - BIV). These retroviruses are considered to be species-specific, so the key issue for the dairy industry is the nutritional and raw value of milk of infected cows (without clinical signs). Milk of infected with leukemia cows has changed physical and chemical properties and microbiological parameters, but it is allowed to be processed after a single pasteurization. Thus, there is a possibility of getting of the infected with retroviruses cow's milk into the bulk milk, which can affect the quality of the processed products. Characteristics of BlV-positive cow's milk have not yet been studied. The aim of the research was the study of influence of BLV- and BLV- BIV-infected cows' milk impurities (10, 30 small i, Cyrillic 50%) on organoleptic, physicochemical and microbiological parameters of produced kefir drink. It is revealed that with increasing the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk, acidity of composite samples increased of 1-3 degrees T and total viable bacteria's count rose by 1-3 orders of magnitude, while the total protein in milk decreased by 0.05-0.95% contrasted with an increasing of milk fat content by 0.3-0.9%. However, these characteristics were within normal limits. In samples containing 50% of milk infected with retroviruses cows, coliforms were detected in 0.1 ml, and the rate of total viable bacteria's count exceeded the permissible limits. Therefore, microbiological characteristics are determination markers of dairy raw materials with the high content of milk of the infected with retroviruses cows. The kefir drink was produced from pasteurized samples. It was found that the acidity of the product was lower by 1-10 degrees T, while the processing time increased by 4-50%, correlating with the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk, compared to control. When the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk was 30 and 50%, the processed product had a heterogeneous consistency with flake clots. At the same time, the lactic-acid-producing bacterium count in kefir drink decreased by 2-3 orders, and mold and coliforms were found in it. Thus, the presence more than 10% of milk from infected with retroviruses cows in raw materials leads to a decrease in its technological properties, and dose 30 and 50% leads to non-compliance of the processed product with hygienic standards.","['Krasnikova, E S', 'Larionova, O S', 'Krasnikov, A V', 'Kazieva, G Kh']","['Krasnikova ES', 'Larionova OS', 'Krasnikov AV', 'Kazieva GK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4395-5862', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5457-0306', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4127-8725', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6659-0483']","['Saratov State Agrarian University named after N.I.

However, there has been no significant progress in the field of the treatment that can lead to the development of a successful vaccine. Furthermore, there are no means of assessing the risk of disease and its prognosis in the infected people. METHODS: The current study has taken the cognizance of the importance of host's immune response in reducing the risk of infectious diseases to carry out immunoinformatics driven epitope screening strategy of vaccine candidates against HTLV-1. In this study, a genetic variability and HLA distribution analysis among the documented HTLV-1 genotypes I, II, III, IV, V & VI was performed to ensure the coverage of the vast majority of population, where vaccine would be employed. The meticulous screening of effective dominant immunogens was done with the help of ABCPred and Immune Epitope Database. RESULTS: The results showed that the identified epitopes might be protective immunogens with high conservancy and potential of inducing both protective neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. The peptides ""PSQLPPTAPPLLPHSNLDHI"", ""PCPNLVAYSSYHATY"", and ""YHATYSLYLF"", were 100% conserved among different isolates from far and wide separated countries, suggesting negligible antigenic drift in HTLV-1. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mentioned epitopes are soluble, non-toxic suitable candidates for the development of vaccine against HTLV-1 and warrant further investigation and experimental validation.","['Bano, Tasneem', 'Mohammed Janahi, Essam', 'Dhasmana, Anupam', 'Lohani, Mohtashim', 'Haque, Shaful', 'K Mandal, Raju', 'A Dar, Sajad', 'Jawed, Arshad', 'Wahid, Mohd', 'Akhter, Naseem', 'Y Areeshi, Mohammed']","['Bano T', 'Mohammed Janahi E', 'Dhasmana A', 'Lohani M', 'Haque S', 'K Mandal R', 'A Dar S', 'Jawed A', 'Wahid M', 'Akhter N', 'Y Areeshi M']",,"['Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicoinformatics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering & Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2018 Sep-Oct;23(5):1514-1527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetal calf serum (FCS) is the most commonly used media supplement worldwide. FCS contains a mixture of largely undefined growth factors and cytokines, which support cell proliferation. This undefined nature of FCS is a source of experimental variation, undesired immune responses, possible contaminations, and because of its way of production an ethical concern. Thus, alternative, defined, valid, and reliable media supplements should be characterized in a large number of experiments. Human platelet lysate (hPL) is increasingly appreciated as an alternative to FCS. Since it is unclear whether cells respond differentially to clinically relevant chemotherapeutics inducing replicative stress and DNA damage (Hydroxyurea, Irinotecan), induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKi) Imatinib, and novel epigenetic modifiers belonging to the group of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), we investigated these issues. Here we show that cancer cells derived from leukemia and colon cancer grow very similarly in culture media with FCS or outdated hPL. Notably, cells have practically identical proteomes under both culture conditions. Moreover, cells grown with FCS or hPL respond equally to all types of drugs and stress conditions that we have tested. In addition, the transfection of blood cells by electroporation can be achieved under both conditions. Furthermore, we reveal that class I HDACs, but not HDAC6, are required for the expression of the pan-leukemic marker WT1 under various culture conditions. Hence, hPL is a moderately priced substitute for FCS in various experimental settings.","['Pons, Miriam', 'Nagel, Georg', 'Zeyn, Yanira', 'Beyer, Mandy', 'Laguna, Teresa', 'Brachetti, Tina', 'Sellmer, Andreas', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh', 'Conradi, Roland', 'Butter, Falk', 'Kramer, Oliver H']","['Pons M', 'Nagel G', 'Zeyn Y', 'Beyer M', 'Laguna T', 'Brachetti T', 'Sellmer A', 'Mahboobi S', 'Conradi R', 'Butter F', 'Kramer OH']",,"['Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry I, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry I, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Transfusion Centre, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,ALTEX,ALTEX,100953980,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)']",,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Serum']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14573/altex.1809211 [doi]'],ppublish,ALTEX. 2019;36(2):277-288. doi: 10.14573/altex.1809211.

With the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents, expanded indications for established agents, and increased neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, tMDS/AML risks in the modern age are poorly understood. Objectives: To quantify tMDS/AML risk after chemotherapy for solid cancer among United States adults since 2000 and correlate tMDS/AML risk patterns with chemotherapy treatment practices. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study was conducted using cancer registries from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and Medicare claims. Risk analyses included 1619 tMDS/AML cases among 700612 adults (age, 20-84 years) who were diagnosed with first primary solid cancer during 2000 to 2013 (followed up through 2014), received initial chemotherapy, and survived 1 year or longer, as reported to SEER. Descriptive analyses were conducted of SEER records linked with Medicare claims for chemotherapy in 165820 older adults (age, 66-84 years) receiving initial chemotherapy for a first primary solid cancer in 2000-2013. Data analysis was conducted from October 2017 to April 2018. Exposures: Receipt of initial chemotherapy for solid cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Second primary tMDS/AML. Results: Based on 1619 tMDS/AML cases in the SEER database (mean [SD] age, 64.3 [12.2] years; 1148 [70.9%] female), tMDS/AML risks were statistically significantly elevated after chemotherapy for 22 of 23 solid cancers (all except colon). Relative risks ranged from 1.5 to greater than 10 and excess absolute risks from 1.4 to greater than 15 cases per 10000 person-years compared with the general population. Overall survival following tMDS/AML diagnosis was poor (1270 of 1619 patients [78.4%] died; median overall survival, 7 months). For patients treated with chemotherapy at the present time, approximately three-quarters of tMDS/AML cases expected to occur within the next 5 years will be attributable to chemotherapy. In the SEER-Medicare database, use of known leukemogenic agents, particularly platinum compounds, in initial chemotherapy increased substantially since 2000, most notably for gastrointestinal tract cancers (esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum; 10% in 2000-2001 to 81% during 2012-2013). Conclusions and Relevance: Large-scale, United States population-based data demonstrate excess tMDS/AML risks following chemotherapy for nearly all solid tumor types, consistent with expanded use of known leukemogenic agents in the 21st century. Continued efforts to reduce treatment-related adverse events, particularly for solid cancer patients with favorable prognosis, are needed.","['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Schonfeld, Sara J', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Sigel, Byron S', 'Lam, Clara J K', 'Tucker, Margaret A', 'Curtis, Rochelle E']","['Morton LM', 'Dores GM', 'Schonfeld SJ', 'Linet MS', 'Sigel BS', 'Lam CJK', 'Tucker MA', 'Curtis RE']",,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Human Genetics Program, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261201000140C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003862/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6439835,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2718413 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.5625 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2019 Mar 1;5(3):318-325. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.5625.,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2019 Mar 1;5(3):303-304.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of TPE in 29 recipients with major ABOi HSCT based on the following: (1) requirement of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during 100 days, (2) erythrocyte engraftment by reticulocyte count at 3 months, and (3) erythropoiesis recovery by bone marrow examination at 1 month and 3 months after ABOi HSCT. RESULTS: IgM and IgG donor-specific isoagglutinins (DSIs) of 31 cases of TPE were significantly decreased after three consecutive TPEs (IgM median, 1:32 to 1:2, P < .0001; IgG median, 1:256 to 1:8, P < .0001). We divided a total of 31 TPEs into two groups depending on their final DSI titers after TPE (group F, DSI > 1:16; group S, DSI </= 1:16). RBC transfusions were required more by group F (median, 12 units) than those by group S (median, 2 units, P = .001). Relative frequencies of erythrocyte engraftment and normal erythropoiesis after ABOi HSCT showed higher tendencies in group S than those in group F. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that three consecutive TPEs were effective in reducing DSI titer in major ABOi HSCT. Reduction of pretransplant DSI in recipients could decrease requirement for RBC transfusion. Three consecutive TPEs are necessary for successful erythrocyte engraftment and normal erythropoiesis in this setting.","['Choi, Seung Jun', 'Kim, Hoon Seok', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Lim, Jihyang']","['Choi SJ', 'Kim HS', 'Kim Y', 'Lee JW', 'Lim J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1459-8843'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Agglutinins)']",IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adult', 'Agglutinins/*isolation & purification', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*prevention & control', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Exchange/methods/*standards', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21680 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2019 Aug;34(4):367-372. doi: 10.1002/jca.21680.

Phosphorylation of eIF4E by MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks) is essential for the eIF4E-mediated oncogenic activity. As such, the pharmacological inhibition of Mnks can be an effective strategy for the treatment of cancer. METHODS: A series of N-phenyl-4-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine derivatives was designed and synthesised. The Mnk inhibitory activity of these derivatives as well as their anti-proliferative activity against MV4-11 AML cells was determined. RESULTS: These compounds were identified as potent Mnk2 inhibitors. Most of them demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activity against MV4-11 AML cells. The cellular mechanistic studies of the representative inhibitors revealed that they reduced the level of phosphorylated eIF4E and induced apoptosis by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1) and by cleaving poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). The lead compound 7k possessed desirable pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. CONCLUSION: This work proposes that exploration of the structural diversity in the context of Nphenyl- 4-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine would offer potent and selective Mnk inhibitors.","['Abdelaziz, Ahmed M', 'Diab, Sarah', 'Islam, Saiful', 'Basnet, Sunita K C', 'Noll, Benjamin', 'Li, Peng', 'Mekonnen, Laychiluh B', 'Lu, Jingfeng', 'Albrecht, Hugo', 'Milne, Robert W', 'Gerber, Cobus', 'Yu, Mingfeng', 'Wang, Shudong']","['Abdelaziz AM', 'Diab S', 'Islam S', 'Basnet SKC', 'Noll B', 'Li P', 'Mekonnen LB', 'Lu J', 'Albrecht H', 'Milne RW', 'Gerber C', 'Yu M', 'Wang S']",,"['Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (MKNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-95315 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406415666181219111511 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2019;15(6):602-623. doi: 10.2174/1573406415666181219111511.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mnk', 'N-Phenyl-4-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine', 'antileukaemia', 'eIF4E', 'inhibitor', 'structure-activity relationship.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miconidin acetate (MA) is a hydroquinone derivative isolated from E. hiemalis. In this study we demonstrated that MA was cytotoxic against acute leukemia (AL), solid tumor cells and cancer stem cells, with the strongest effect exhibited against AL. Furthermore, it was non-cytotoxic against non-tumor cells and did not cause significant hemolysis. MA blocks the G2/M phase and causes cytostatic effects, acting in a similar way to dexamethasone by increasing PML expression. The compound also triggered intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by modulating Bax, FasR and survivin expression. This led to an extensive mitochondrial damage that resulted in AIF, cytochrome c and endonuclease G release, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. We have further demonstrated that MA was strongly cytotoxic against neoplastic cells collected from patients with different AL subtypes.

This abberation deregulates numerous molecular pathways including the ERK signalling pathway among others. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the gene expression patterns following siRNAmediated suppression of RUNX1RUNX1T1 and MAPK1 in Kasumi1 and SKNO1 cells and to determine the differentially expressed genes in enriched biological pathways. BeadChip microarray and gene ontology analysis revealed that RUNX1RUNX1T1 and MAPK1 suppression reduced the proliferation rate of the t(8;21) cells with deregulated expression of several classical positive regulator genes that are otherwise known to enhance cell proliferation. RUNX1RUNX1T1 suppression exerted an antiapoptotic effect through the overexpression of BCL2, BIRC3 and CFLAR genes, while MAPK1 suppression induced apopotosis in t(8;21) cells by the apoptotic mitochondrial changes stimulated by the activity of upregulated TP53 and TNFSF10, and downregulated JUN gene. RUNX1RUNX1T1 suppression supported myeloid differentiation by the differential expression of CEBPA, CEBPE, ID2, JMJD6, IKZF1, CBFB, KIT and CDK6, while MAPK1 depletion inhibited the differentiation of t(8;21) cells by elevated expression of ADA and downregulation of JUN. RUNX1RUNX1T1 and MAPK1 depletion induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Accumulation of cells in the G1 phase was largely the result of downregulated expression of TBRG4, CCNE2, FOXO4, CDK6, ING4, IL8, MAD2L1 and CCNG2 in the case of RUNX1RUNX1T1 depletion and increased expression of RASSF1, FBXO6, DADD45A and P53 in the case of MAPK1 depletion. Taken together, the current results demonstrate that MAPK1 promotes myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation simultaneously by cell cycle progression while suppresing apoptosis.","['Bashanfer, Salem Ali Al-Salem', 'Saleem, Mohamed', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Moses, Emmanuel Jairaj', 'Yusoff, Narazah Mohd']","['Bashanfer SAA', 'Saleem M', 'Heidenreich O', 'Moses EJ', 'Yusoff NM']",,"['Hematology Department, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Hodiedah, Hodiedah 3730, Yemen.', 'Advanced Genomics Lab Sdn Bhd, Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan 47810, Malaysia.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bertam, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang 13200, Malaysia.', 'Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bertam, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang 13200, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2018.6926 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2019 Mar;41(3):2027-2040. doi: 10.3892/or.2018.6926.

However, the possible anticancer effects of imatinib in gastric cancer have not yet been explored. The present study evaluated the in vitro effects of imatinib on gastric cancer cells and determined the molecular mechanism underlying these effects. We determined that imatinib induced mitochondriamediated apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressassociated activation of cJun NH2terminal kinase (JNK). We also found that imatinib suppressed cell proliferation in a time and dosedependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinibtreated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinibtreated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stressassociated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth, compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone. These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stressassociated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting plateletderived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.","['Kim, Jung Lim', 'Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Jeong, Soyeon', 'Kim, Bo Ram', 'Na, Yoo Jin', 'Park, Seong Hye', 'Jo, Min Jee', 'Jeong, Yoon A', 'Oh, Sang Cheul']","['Kim JL', 'Lee DH', 'Jeong S', 'Kim BR', 'Na YJ', 'Park SH', 'Jo MJ', 'Jeong YA', 'Oh SC']",,"['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul 08308, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ERN1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Irinotecan/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",PMC6365688,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2018.6945 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2019 Mar;41(3):1616-1626. doi: 10.3892/or.2018.6945.

The HLEB3 human lens epithelial cell line was transfected with miR15a3p mimic. Expression of the miR15a3p mimic was measured by fluorescencebased reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration were investigated using MTT and plate clone formation assays, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and flow cytometry, and a wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The protein expression levels of Bcell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) were also compared between transfected and wildtype HLEB3 cells by western blot analysis. The results showed that transfection with the miR15a3p mimic significantly suppressed the proliferation of HLEB3 cells, induced cell apoptosis and increased the proportion of early apoptotic cells. The migration of HLEB3 cells was significantly inhibited following transfection with miR15a3p mimic (P<0.01), whereas cell invasion was unaffected (P>0.05). In addition, reduced protein levels of BCL2 and MCL1 were observed in the miR15a3p mimictransfected HLEB3 cells (P<0.01). In conclusion, miR15a3p may suppress cell proliferation and migration, and induce cell apoptosis in lens epithelial cells through inhibiting the expression of BCL2 and MCL1, which contributes to the onset of ARCs.","['Liu, Shu-Jun', 'Wang, Wen-Ting', 'Zhang, Feng-Lan', 'Yu, Yong-Hong', 'Yu, Hua-Jun', 'Liang, Yan', 'Li, Ning', 'Li, Yuan-Bin']","['Liu SJ', 'Wang WT', 'Zhang FL', 'Yu YH', 'Yu HJ', 'Liang Y', 'Li N', 'Li YB']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, Shandong 264000, P.R.

In this study, the effects of two newly synthesized of colchicine derivatives were investigated on cell viability of cancerous and normal lymphocytes. The viability test was carried out by MTT assay. Apoptosis vs. necrosis was measured by double staining with annexin V/PI, and caspase-3 as the ultimate mediator of apoptotic measured through the colorimetric assay. Parameters of mitochondrial damage (ROS formation, MMP (Mitochondrial Membrane Potential) decline, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release following treatment by colchicine derivatives. By focusing on mitochondrial parameters, we showed that following treatment by two newly synthesized colchicine derivatives, apoptosis is triggered in cancerous B-lymphocytes. We demonstrated these compounds could activate apoptosis in cancerous lymphocytes by augmentation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial swelling, release of cytochrome c, and also caspase-3 activation.

In summary, these results indicate that ORY-1001 could inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells via regulating the Warburg effect by controlling HK2.","['Lu, Zhaoliang', 'Guo, Yanke', 'Zhang, Xiaoya', 'Li, Jing', 'Li, Leilei', 'Zhang, Shuai', 'Shan, Changliang']","['Lu Z', 'Guo Y', 'Zhang X', 'Li J', 'Li L', 'Zhang S', 'Shan C']",,"['The First Affiliated Hospital, Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6290890,,2018/12/21 06:00,2018/12/21 06:01,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.01411 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Dec 4;9:1411. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.01411. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hexokinases 2', 'Warburg effect', 'cell proliferation', 'lung cancer', 'lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A']",,,20181204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limitations in a number of prior studies on the topic casted doubts on their conclusion that it was safe to play sports on such pitches. Rubber granulate samples from 100 Dutch synthetic turf pitches were analysed for 45 (all samples) or 79 substances (a subset). A subset of samples was additionally analysed for migration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates and metals into sweat and the gastrointestinal tract, and for evaporation of volatile substances into air. Exposure scenarios were developed to estimate the exposure of amateur football players via the oral, dermal and inhalation route to the most hazardous substances in rubber granulate. Risks to human health were assessed by comparing toxicological reference values for these substances with the exposure estimates. A number of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances were present in rubber granulate used on Dutch pitches. No concern was, however, identified for phthalates, benzothiazoles, bisphenol A and the metals cadmium, cobalt and lead, as their exposures were below the levels associated with adverse effects on health. PAHs appeared to be the substances of highest concern, but even they present no appreciable health risk with exposures resulting in additional cancer risks at or below the negligible risk level of one in a million. Our findings for a representative number of Dutch pitches are consistent with those of prior and contemporary studies observing no elevated health risk from playing sports on synthetic turf pitches with recycled rubber granulate. Based on current evidence, there is no reason to advise people against playing sports on such pitches.","['Pronk, Marja E J', 'Woutersen, Marjolijn', 'Herremans, Joke M M']","['Pronk MEJ', 'Woutersen M', 'Herremans JMM']",,"['National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands. marjolijn.woutersen@rivm.nl.', 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,101262796,"['0 (Hazardous Substances)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons)', '6O7F7IX66E (phthalic acid)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)']",IM,"['Environmental Exposure/analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hazardous Substances/analysis', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Metals', 'Phthalic Acids', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/analysis', 'Recycling', 'Risk Assessment', '*Rubber', 'Sports']",PMC7181390,,2018/12/21 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41370-018-0106-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41370-018-0106-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol. 2020 May;30(3):567-584. doi: 10.1038/s41370-018-0106-1.

Preclinical investigations and a complementary safety profile were in support of testing their combined use. The exploratory CLL2-BIG-trial evaluated a sequential combination therapy following a recently proposed strategy. Two courses of bendamustine were used for debulking in patients with a high tumor load, followed by six courses of induction therapy with ibrutinib and GA101, followed by an MRD-triggered maintenance phase. The results of a pre-planned analysis at the end of the induction phase are presented. 61 patients were included, 30 previously untreated and 31 with relapsed/refractory CLL. 44 patients received bendamustine. During induction, neutropenia (14.8%) and thrombocytopenia (13.1%) were the most common CTC grade 3 and 4 events. One fatality (duodenitis) occurred. The overall response rate was 100%. 54.1% of patients achieved a partial remission, 41% a clinical complete remission (cCR) without confirmation by CT scan or bone marrow (BM) biopsy according to protocol and 4.9% a cCR with incomplete recovery of the BM. 29 patients (47.5%) had no detectable (<10(-4)) minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood.

To identify novel effective therapies for this AML subtype, we screened patient cells and engineered cell models with over 300 compounds. We found that mouse hematopoietic progenitors co-expressing NUP98-NSD1 and FLT3-ITD had significantly increased sensitivity to FLT3 and MEK-inhibitors compared to cells expressing either aberration alone (P < 0.001). The cells expressing NUP98-NSD1 alone had significantly increased sensitivity to BCL2-inhibitors (P = 0.029). Furthermore, NUP98-NSD1(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) patient cells were also very sensitive to BCL2-inhibitor navitoclax, although the highest select sensitivity was found to SRC/ABL-inhibitor dasatinib (mean IC50 = 2.2 nM). Topoisomerase inhibitor mitoxantrone was the least effective drug against NUP98-NSD1(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells. Of the 25 significant hits, four remained significant also compared to NUP98-NSD1(-)/FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients. We found that SRC/ABL-inhibitor dasatinib is highly synergistic with BCL2-inhibitor navitoclax in NUP98-NSD1(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) cells. Gene expression analysis supported the potential relevance of dasatinib and navitoclax by revealing significantly higher expression of BCL2A1, FGR, and LCK in NUP98-NSD1(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) patients compared to healthy CD34+ cells. Our data suggest that dasatinib-navitoclax combination may offer a clinically relevant treatment strategy for AML with NUP98-NSD1 and concomitant FLT3-ITD.","['Kivioja, Jarno L', 'Thanasopoulou, Angeliki', 'Kumar, Ashwini', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Yadav, Bhagwan', 'Majumder, Muntasir M', 'Javarappa, Komal K', 'Eldfors, Samuli', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Heckman, Caroline A']","['Kivioja JL', 'Thanasopoulou A', 'Kumar A', 'Kontro M', 'Yadav B', 'Majumder MM', 'Javarappa KK', 'Eldfors S', 'Schwaller J', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman CA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5550-2951', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5056-4750']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. caroline.heckman@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (NUP98-NSD1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage', '*Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0327-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0327-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1360-1372. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0327-2.

Ten cases of NPM1c mutant AML were screened for 111 mutations that are recurrent in AML and cancer. Clonal architectures were relatively simple with one to six sub-clones and were branching in some, but not all, patients. NPM1 mutations were secondary or sub-clonal to other driver mutations (DNM3TA, TET2, WT1 and IDH2) in all cases. In three of the ten cases, single cell analysis of enriched CD34(+)/CD33(-) cells revealed a putative pre-leukaemic sub-clone, undetectable in the bulk CD33(+) population that had one or more driver mutations but lacked NPM1c. Cells from all cases were transplanted into NSG mice and in most (8/10), more than one sub-clone (#2-5 sub-clones) transplanted. However, the dominant regenerating sub-clone in 9/10 cases was NPM1(+) and this sub-clone was either dominant or minor in the diagnostic sample from which it was derived.

The aim of the current study is to assess the progress made for the Dutch pAML population (0-17 years) during 1990-2015, based on trends in incidence, survival and mortality. Data from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry were merged with leukemia-related characteristics and treatment specifics from the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group (Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) from 2002 onwards). Mortality data (1980-2016) were obtained from the cause of death registry of Statistics Netherlands. Trend analyses were performed over time and by treatment protocol. Between 1990 and 2015, a total of 635 children aged 0-17 years were diagnosed with AML for an average of 25 patients (range 18-36) per year. There was a slight increase in the incidence at age 1-4 years (average annual percentage change (AAPC) of +2.2% per year (95% CI 0.8-3.5, p < 0.01)). Overall, the 5-year survival significantly improved over the past 26 years and nearly doubled from 40% in the early 1990s to 74% in 2010-2015. Multivariable analysis showed a 49% reduction in risk of death for pAML patients treated according to the latest DB-AML 01 protocol (p = 0.03). The continuing decrease of mortality (AAPC -2.8% per year (95% CI -4.1 to -1.5)) supports the conclusion of true progress against pAML in the Netherlands.","['Reedijk, A M J', 'Klein, K', 'Coebergh, J W W', 'Kremer, L C', 'Dinmohamed, A G', 'de Haas, V', 'Versluijs, A B', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Beverloo, H B', 'Pieters, R', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Karim-Kos, H E']","['Reedijk AMJ', 'Klein K', 'Coebergh JWW', 'Kremer LC', 'Dinmohamed AG', 'de Haas V', 'Versluijs AB', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Beverloo HB', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Karim-Kos HE']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9794-1071', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4767-6716']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.m.j.reedijk@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center/Dutch Working Group Hemato-oncological Genome Diagnostics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0314-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0314-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1349-1359. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0314-7.

Such migration requires structured cytoskeletal-actin polymerization, which may involve the protein cortactin. We discovered that treatment of CLL cells with Wnt5a causes Receptor tyosin kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) to bind cortactin, which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at Y421, recruits ARHGEF1, and activates RhoA, thereby enhancing leukemia-cell migration; such effects could be inhibited by cirmtuzumab, a humanized mAb specific for ROR1. We transfected the CLL-cell-line MEC1 with either full-length ROR1 or various mutant forms of ROR1 to examine the structural features required for binding cortactin. We found that the proline-rich domain (PRD) was necessary for ROR1 to recruit cortactin. We generated MEC1 cells that each expressed a mutant form of ROR1 with a single amino-acid substitution of alanine (A) for proline (P) in potential SH3-binding sites in the ROR1-PRD at positions 784, 808, 826, 841, or 850. In contrast to wild-type ROR1, or other ROR1(P=>A) mutants, ROR1(P(841)A) failed to complex with cortactin or ARHGEF1 in response to Wnt5a. Moreover, Wnt5a could not induce MEC1-ROR1(P(841)A) to phosphorylate cortactin or enhance CLL-cell F-actin polymerization. Taken together, these studies show that cortactin plays an important role in ROR1-dependent Wnt5a-enhanced CLL-cell migration.","['Hasan, Md Kamrul', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Yu, Jian', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Hasan MK', 'Rassenti L', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Yu J', 'Kipps TJ']",,"['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. tkipps@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA236361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CTTN protein, human)', '0 (Cortactin)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution/drug effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cortactin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",PMC6462876,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0306-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0306-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Mar;33(3):653-661. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0306-7.

Here, we show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SRPK1 leads to cell cycle arrest, leukemic cell differentiation and prolonged survival of mice transplanted with MLL-rearranged AML. RNA-seq analysis demonstrates that SRPK1 inhibition leads to altered isoform levels of many genes including several with established roles in leukemogenesis such as MYB, BRD4 and MED24. We focus on BRD4 as its main isoforms have distinct molecular properties and find that SRPK1 inhibition produces a significant switch from the short to the long isoform at the mRNA and protein levels. This was associated with BRD4 eviction from genomic loci involved in leukemogenesis including BCL2 and MYC. We go on to show that this switch mediates at least part of the anti-leukemic effects of SRPK1 inhibition. Our findings reveal that SRPK1 represents a plausible new therapeutic target against AML.","['Tzelepis, Konstantinos', 'De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Aspris, Demetrios', 'Barbieri, Isaia', 'Vijayabaskar,

DCs play critical roles in GVHD induction. Modulating autophagy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of immunological diseases. Complement receptors C3aR/C5aR expressed on DCs regulate immune responses by translating extracellular signals into intracellular activity. In the current study, we found that C3aR/C5aR deficiency enhanced ceramide-dependent lethal mitophagy (CDLM) in DCs. Cotransfer of host-type C3aR-/-/C5aR-/- DCs in the recipients significantly improved GVHD outcome after allogeneic HCT, primarily through enhancing CDLM in DCs. C3aR/C5aR deficiency in the host hematopoietic compartment significantly reduced GVHD severity via impairing Th1 differentiation and donor T cell glycolytic activity while enhancing Treg generation. Prophylactic treatment with C3aR/C5aR antagonists effectively alleviated GVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Altogether, we demonstrate that inhibiting C3aR/C5aR induces lethal mitophagy in DCs, which represents a potential therapeutic approach to control GVHD while preserving the GVL effect.","['Nguyen, Hung', 'Kuril, Sandeepkumar', 'Bastian, David', 'Kim, Jisun', 'Zhang, Mengmeng', 'Vaena, Silvia G', 'Dany, Mohammed', 'Dai, Min', 'Heinrichs, Jessica Lauren', 'Daenthanasanmak, Anusara', 'Iamsawat, Supinya', 'Schutt, Steven', 'Fu, Jianing', 'Wu, Yongxia', 'Fairlie, David P', 'Atkinson, Carl', 'Ogretmen, Besim', 'Tomlinson, Stephen', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Nguyen H', 'Kuril S', 'Bastian D', 'Kim J', 'Zhang M', 'Vaena SG', 'Dany M', 'Dai M', 'Heinrichs JL', 'Daenthanasanmak A', 'Iamsawat S', 'Schutt S', 'Fu J', 'Wu Y', 'Fairlie DP', 'Atkinson C', 'Ogretmen B', 'Tomlinson S', 'Yu XZ']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Surgery, Transplant Immunobiology Laboratory.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Research Service, Ralph H.

Maximum rates of opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of 14 different M types promoted by rabbit antiserum against the 30-valent M protein-based vaccine were comparable in whole-blood and HL-60 assays. Data are also presented showing OPK serum titers (opsonic index) of naturally acquired human antibodies present in IVIG [intravenous immune globulin (human)]. Results of the HL-60 assay performed on different days using 21 different M types of GAS and IVIG as the antibody source were significantly concordant. This report indicates that the OPK assay conditions may be optimized for the measurement of opsonic antibodies against a number of epidemiologically important M types of GAS and, once standardized, should facilitate the clinical development of effective vaccines to prevent these infections.IMPORTANCE Measuring functional opsonic antibodies against group A streptococci is an important component of the clinical development path for effective vaccines. Prior studies have used an assay developed over 60 years ago that relied on whole human blood as the source of phagocytes and complement, both of which are critical components of antibody-mediated killing assays. In this study, we adapted an assay that uses the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line as phagocytic cells and baby rabbit serum as a source of complement for detection of opsonic antibodies against group A streptococci. On the basis of some of the known biological characteristics of the bacteria, we modified the assay conditions to support the evaluation of 21 epidemiologically important M types and demonstrated the utility and reproducibility of the assay for measurement of functional opsonic antibody levels.","['Salehi, Sanaz', 'Hohn, Claudia M', 'Penfound, Thomas A', 'Dale, James B']","['Salehi S', 'Hohn CM', 'Penfound TA', 'Dale JB']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA jbdale@uthsc.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Biochemistry, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center Research Service, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI010085/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI132117/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,mSphere,mSphere,101674533,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Microbial Viability', 'Opsonin Proteins/*blood', '*Phagocytosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/*immunology']",PMC6300688,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['3/6/e00617-18 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00617-18 [doi]']",epublish,mSphere. 2018 Dec 19;3(6). pii: 3/6/e00617-18. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00617-18.,['Copyright (c) 2018 Salehi et al.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Streptococcus pyogenes', '*group A streptococcus', '*opsonic antibodies', '*vaccines']",,,20181219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that loss of PHF6 is an early mutational event in leukemia transformation. Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of Phf6 in the hematopoietic system enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) long-term self-renewal and hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy by rendering Phf6 knockout HSCs more quiescent and less prone to stress-induced activation. Consistent with a leukemia-initiating tumor suppressor role, inactivation of Phf6 in hematopoietic progenitors lowers the threshold for the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Moreover, loss of Phf6 in leukemia lymphoblasts activates a leukemia stem cell transcriptional program and drives enhanced T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell activity. These results implicate Phf6 in the control of HSC homeostasis and long-term self-renewal and support a role for PHF6 loss as a driver of leukemia-initiating cell activity in T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Phf6 controls HSC homeostasis, leukemia initiation, and T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell self-renewal. These results substantiate a role for PHF6 mutations as early events and drivers of leukemia stem cell activity in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 305.","['Wendorff, Agnieszka A', 'Quinn, S Aidan', 'Rashkovan, Marissa', 'Madubata, Chioma J', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Wendorff AA', 'Quinn SA', 'Rashkovan M', 'Madubata CJ', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Litzow MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta E', 'Paganin M', 'Basso G', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Loh ML', 'Rabadan R', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Ferrando AA']",,"['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Onco-Hematology Division, Department, Salute della Donna e del Bambino (SDB), University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Onco-Hematology Division, Department, Salute della Donna e del Bambino (SDB), University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (HMG), Turin, Italy.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Department of Pathology, Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York. af2196@columbia.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['R35 CA210065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA017145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA193313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA185486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA209997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (Phf6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6425751,['NIHMS1517122'],2018/12/21 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-18-1005 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2019 Mar;9(3):436-451. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1005.

However, the signaling pathways underlying benzene-induced hematotoxicity remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the regulation of benzene-induced hematotoxicity in a murine model. Male mice with a hepatocyte-specific homozygous deletion of the Ppp2r1a gene (encoding PP2A Aalpha subunit) (HO) and matched wildtype (WT) mice were exposed to benzene via inhalation at doses of 1, 10, and 100 ppm for 28 days. Peripheral white blood cell counts and activation of bone marrow progenitors were attenuated in the HO mice, indicating that Ppp2r1a deletion protects against benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Moreover, elevation of urinary S-phenyl mercapturic acid, a benzene metabolite, was much greater in WT mice than in HO mice. Real-time exhalation analysis revealed more exhaled benzene but fewer benzene metabolites in HO mice than in WT mice, possibly because of the down-regulation of Cyp2e1, encoding cytochrome P4502E1, in hepatocytes of the HO mice. Loss-of-function screening disclosed that PP2A complexes containing the B56alpha subunit participate in regulating Cyp2e1 expression. Notably, PP2A-B56alpha suppression in HepG2 cells resulted in persistent beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser(33)-Ser(37)-Thr(41) in response to CYP2E1 agonists. In parallel, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was inhibited, concomitant with a remarkable decrease of Cyp2e1 expression. These findings support the notion that a regulatory cascade comprising PP2A-B56alpha, beta-catenin, and Cyp2e1 is involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity, providing critical insight into the role of PP2A in responses to the environmental chemicals.","['Chen, Liping', 'Guo, Ping', 'Zhang, Haiyan', 'Li, Wenxue', 'Gao, Chen', 'Huang, Zhenlie', 'Fan, Junling', 'Zhang, Yuling', 'Li, Xue', 'Liu,

This study was designed to explore the potential biomarker, especially regeneration of haematopoiesis, of treatment response and survival in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. METHOD: We analysed the clinical data of 117 elderly AML patients who were treated with a decitabine dose of 15 mg/m(2) for 5 days, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of 300 mug/d for priming, plus cytarabine 10 mg/m(2) q12h for 7 days and aclarubicin 10 mg/d for 4 days (D-CAG). RESULTS: After initial induction chemotherapy, the overall response rate and complete remission (CR) were 71.8% and 58.1%, respectively. Patients responding to the D-CAG regimen achieved higher platelet counts on day 14 after initial treatment (p < 0.001). Median counts were 59.5 x 10(9)/L in the CR group, 37 x 10(9)/L in the partial remission group and 28 x 10(9)/L in the non-responsive group. We then classified patients into those who achieved platelet counts>/=60 x 10(9)/L or 100 x 10(9)/L on day 14 after D-CAG vs. those who did not. Platelet counts>/=60 x 10(9)/L or 100 x 10(9)/L on day 14 were significantly associated with superior CR, overall survival and disease-free survival (80.9% vs. 45.3% p < 0.001,16.5 vs. 9.1 months p = 0.009 and 16.3 vs. 7.4 months p = 0.024; 85.2% vs. 50% p = 0.001, 31 vs. 10.1 months p = 0.003 and 16.9 vs. 8.9 months p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis confirmed that poor cytogenetics (p = 0.010) and FLT3-ITD mutation (p = 0.007) were identified as independent factors of OS, but not platelet count (p = 0.091).

Aiming to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity, this study examined the effect of AB23A on mast cells and allergic reaction. AB23A inhibited the degranulation of mast cells stimulated by immunoglobulin E/antigen (IgE/Ag), and also decreased the synthesis of leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)), production of interlukin-6 (IL-6), and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a concentration-dependent manner with no significant cytotoxicity in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). AB23A inhibited spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and the downstream signaling molecules including phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), serine-threonine protein kinase/inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase/nuclear factor kappa-B (Akt/IKK/NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases/cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (MAPK/cPLA(2)). Furthermore, AB23A blocked mobilization of Ca(2+). Similar results were obtained in other mast cell lines Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells and a human mast cell line (HMC-1). In addition, AB23A attenuated allergic responses in an acute allergy animal model, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA). Taken together, this study suggests that AB23A inhibits the activation of mast cells and ameliorates allergic reaction, and may become a lead compound for the treatment of mast cell-mediated allergic diseases.","['Shao, Chen', 'Fu, Bingjie', 'Ji, Ning', 'Pan, Shunli', 'Zhao, Xiaoxia', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Qiu, Yuling', 'Wang, Ran', 'Jin, Meihua', 'Wen, Ke', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Shao C', 'Fu B', 'Ji N', 'Pan S', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang Z', 'Qiu Y', 'Wang R', 'Jin M', 'Wen K', 'Kong D']",,"['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. 15840941135@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. 15840941135@163.com.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. fubingjie@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. ningji@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. panshunli@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. zhaoxiaoxia@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. zhangzhe@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. qiuyuling@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. wangran@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. jinmeihua@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. kewencn@163.com.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. kongdexin@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China. kongdexin@tmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['81672809, 81673464, 81373441/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016M601277/China Postdoctoral Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cholestenones)', '0 (alisol B 23-acetate)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cholestenones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukotriene C4/biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Rats', 'Spleen/drug effects/enzymology', 'Syk Kinase']",PMC6320761,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/03/30 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19124092 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19124092 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Dec 18;19(12). pii: ijms19124092. doi: 10.3390/ijms19124092.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AB23A', 'IgE', 'PCA', 'mast cell']",,,20181218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood differential revealed leucopaenia with absolute neutropaenia and a 5% abnormal promyelocytes but no blasts, suspicious for APML. Bone marrow biopsy was performed and fluorescence in situ hydridization (FISH), karyotype and PCR confirmed a t(15;17) translocation, establishing a diagnosis of APML.

There was no history of risk factors for liver disease, and a search for the underlying causes of hepatotoxicity was unremarkable. Imatinib was stopped and she was treated with steroids which resulted in dramatic improvement of liver function tests.

Population pharmacokinetics analyses were performed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling on pooled data from 3 clinical studies, and the impact of CPX-351 exposures on efficacy and safety was assessed. The pharmacokinetics of cytarabine and daunorubicin were described using 2-compartment models with linear elimination. None of the evaluated covariates had a clinically significant impact on plasma exposure to total cytarabine or daunorubicin, while bilirubin and formulation showed statistically significant effects on pharmacokinetic parameters of cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively. In patients with mild/moderate renal impairment or serum bilirubin </=3 mg/dL, plasma exposures to cytarabine and daunorubicin following CPX-351 were within the variability range for patients with normal kidney function or serum bilirubin levels. Exposure-response analysis demonstrated that better efficacy outcomes were associated with higher CPX-351 exposure quartiles. Early mortality rates in all CPX-351 exposure quartiles were lower vs the 7 + 3 control group, and lower mortality rates were associated with higher exposure quartiles. A trend toward greater frequency of grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (but not grade 4/5 events) was observed at higher CPX-351 exposure quartiles. Overall, the population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate no adjustments to the recommended dose and schedule of CPX-351 are warranted for patients with mild/moderate renal impairment or serum bilirubin </=3 mg/dL. Results from the exposure-response analyses suggest the current CPX-351 regimen provides a favorable risk-benefit profile.","['Wang, Qi', 'Banerjee, Kamalika', 'Vasilinin, Grygoriy', 'Marier, J F', 'Gibbons, Jacqueline A']","['Wang Q', 'Banerjee K', 'Vasilinin G', 'Marier JF', 'Gibbons JA']",,"['Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6590377,,2018/12/20 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1366 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 May;59(5):748-762. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1366.

Serine incorporator proteins 3 (SERINC3) and 5 (SERINC5) were recently identified as restriction factors that reduce HIV-1 infectivity. Here, we compared the antiviral activity of SERINC3 and SERINC5 among mice, rats and rabbits, and their susceptibility to viral counteraction to their human counterparts. In the absence of viral antagonists, rodent and lagomorph SERINC3 and SERINC5 displayed anti-HIV activity in a similar range to human controls. Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped virions were considerably less sensitive to restriction by all SERINC3/5 orthologs. Interestingly, HIV-1 Nef, murine leukemia virus (MLV) GlycoGag and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) S2 counteracted the antiviral activity of all SERINC3/5 orthologs with similar efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the antiviral activity of SERINC3/5 proteins is conserved in rodents and rabbits, and can be overcome by all three previously reported viral antagonists.","['de Sousa-Pereira, Patricia', 'Abrantes, Joana', 'Bauernfried, Stefan', 'Pierini, Virginia', 'Esteves, Pedro Jose', 'Keppler, Oliver T', 'Pizzato, Massimo', 'Hornung, Veit', 'Fackler, Oliver T', 'Baldauf, Hanna-Mari']","['de Sousa-Pereira P', 'Abrantes J', 'Bauernfried S', 'Pierini V', 'Esteves PJ', 'Keppler OT', 'Pizzato M', 'Hornung V', 'Fackler OT', 'Baldauf HM']",,"['3Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', '1CIBIO/InBIO- Research Network in Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Campus de Vairao, University of Porto, Vairao, Portugal.', '5Institute of Virology, Technische Universitat Munchen/Helmholtz Zentrum, Munich, Germany.', '4Max von Pettenkofer Institute & Gene Center, Virology, National Reference Center for Retroviruses, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany.', '2Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', '1CIBIO/InBIO- Research Network in Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Campus de Vairao, University of Porto, Vairao, Portugal.', '6Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry, LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany.', '7Department of Infectious Diseases, Integrative Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', '1CIBIO/InBIO- Research Network in Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Campus de Vairao, University of Porto, Vairao, Portugal.', '2Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', '8CITS - Centro de Investigacao em Tecnologias de Saude, CESPU, Gandra, Portugal.', '3Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', '4Max von Pettenkofer Institute & Gene Center, Virology, National Reference Center for Retroviruses, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany.', '5Institute of Virology, Technische Universitat Munchen/Helmholtz Zentrum, Munich, Germany.', '9University of Trento, Centre for Integrative Biology, Trento, Italy.', '6Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry, LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany.', '7Department of Infectious Diseases, Integrative Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', '5Institute of Virology, Technische Universitat Munchen/Helmholtz Zentrum, Munich, Germany.', '3Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', '4Max von Pettenkofer Institute & Gene Center, Virology, National Reference Center for Retroviruses, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (nef protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*growth & development/*immunology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Immunologic Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Vesiculovirus/genetics/growth & development', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.001201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2019 Feb;100(2):278-288. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001201.

Epidemiological study reporting the diagnostic-therapeutic approach and outcome in 89 cases.,252-260,10.1111/myc.12884 [doi],"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) of the Central Nervous System (IFI-CNS) and Paranasal Sinuses (IFI-PS) are rare, life-threatening infections in haematologic patients, and their management remains a challenge despite the availability of new diagnostic techniques and novel antifungal agents. In addition, analyses of large cohorts of patients focusing on these rare IFI are still lacking. Between January 2010 and December 2016, 89 consecutive cases of Proven (53) or Probable (36) IFI-CNS (71/89) and IFI-PS (18/89) were collected in 34 haematological centres. The median age was 40 years (range 5-79); acute leukaemia was the most common underlying disease (69%) and 29% of cases received a previous allogeneic stem cell transplant. Aspergillus spp. were the most common pathogens (69%), followed by mucormycetes (22%), Cryptococcus spp. (4%) and Fusarium spp. (2%). The lung was the primary focus of fungal infection (48% of cases). The nervous system biopsy was performed in 10% of IFI-CNS, and a sinus biopsy was performed in 56% of IFI-PS (P = 0.03). The Galactomannan test on cerebrospinal fluid has been performed in 42% of IFI-CNS (30/71), and it was positive in 67%. Eighty-four pts received a first-line antifungal therapy with Amphotericine B in 58% of cases, Voriconazole in 31% and both in 11%. Moreover, 58% of patients received 2 or more lines of therapy and 38% were treated with a combination of 2 or more antifungal drugs. The median duration of antifungal therapy was 60 days (range 5-835). A surgical intervention was performed in 26% of cases but only 10% of IFI-CNS underwent neurosurgical intervention. The overall response rate to antifungal therapy (complete or partial response) was 57%, and 1-year overall survival was 32% without significant differences between IFI-CNS and IFI-PS. The overall mortality was 69% but the IFI attributable mortality was 33%. Mortality of IFI-CNS/PS remains high but, compared to previous historical data, it seems to be reduced probably due to the availability of newer antifungal drugs. The results arising from this large contemporary cohort of cases may allow a more effective diagnostic and therapeutic management of these very rare IFI complications in haematologic patients.","['Candoni, A', 'Klimko, N', 'Busca, A', 'Di Blasi, R', 'Shadrivova, O', 'Cesaro, S', 'Zannier, M E', 'Verga, L', 'Forghieri, F', 'Calore, E', 'Nadali, G', 'Simonetti, E', 'Muggeo, P', 'Quinto, A M', 'Castagnola, C', 'Cellini, M', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Fracchiolla, N', 'Melillo, L', 'Piedimonte, M', 'Zama, D', 'Farina, F', 'Giusti, D', 'Mosna, F', 'Capelli, D', 'Delia, M', 'Picardi, M', 'Decembrino, N', 'Perruccio, K', 'Vallero, S', 'Aversa, F', 'Fanin, R', 'Pagano, L']","['Candoni A', 'Klimko N', 'Busca A', 'Di Blasi R', 'Shadrivova O', 'Cesaro S', 'Zannier ME', 'Verga L', 'Forghieri F', 'Calore E', 'Nadali G', 'Simonetti E', 'Muggeo P', 'Quinto AM', 'Castagnola C', 'Cellini M', 'Del Principe MI', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Melillo L', 'Piedimonte M', 'Zama D', 'Farina F', 'Giusti D', 'Mosna F', 'Capelli D', 'Delia M', 'Picardi M', 'Decembrino N', 'Perruccio K', 'Vallero S', 'Aversa F', 'Fanin R', 'Pagano L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4436-1310'],"['Clinica Ematologica, ASUI, Udine, Italy.', 'Metchnikov North-Western State Medical University, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'S.C.

METHODS: After the lentiviral CD47-siRNA was transfected into acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the proliferative status of acute myelogenous LSCs was detected by cell counting kit-8, and the apoptosis of stem cells of acute myeloid leukemia was detected by annexin/propidium iodide flow assays. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, MCL-1, PIK3p110beta, and interleukin (IL)-3 in acute myeloid LSCs was detected by Western blot analysis and the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the protein content of CD96 and CD90 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: After transfection of the lentivirus CD47-siRNA into acute myeloid LSCs, compared with the empty vector transfection group (control group), the cell viability of the CD47-siRNA transfection group was decreased, and the apoptosis rate was increased. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and MCL-1 and the content of IL-3 protein, CD96, and CD90 was decreased, whereas the activity of PIK3p110beta and PP2A protein was increased. CONCLUSION: Targeted inhibition of CD47 could inhibit the proliferation of myeloid LSCs, promote apoptosis, mobilize the cells into the cell cycle, and reduce the high expression of immune proteins on the cell surface, therefore providing a theoretical basis for the elimination and eradication of LSCs.","['Song, Guangle', 'Yang, Leiying']","['Song G', 'Yang L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8228-2424'],"['Morphological Laboratory, Taishan Medical College, Taian, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Taishan Medical College, Taian, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD47 Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28314 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Jun;120(6):10303-10309. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28314.

LIF inhibits the proliferation and survival of several myeloid leukemia cells but promotes tumor progression and metastasis in many solid tumors. However, the relationship between LIF and gastric cancer has not been well understood. LIF was downregulated in gastric cancer as detected by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Notably, LIF was downregulated in approximately 70% (56/80) of primary gastric cancers, in which it was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival (median 5-year survival = 26 vs. 43 months for patients with high LIF expression and low LIF expression gastric cancer, respectively). To study the potential function of LIF in the downregulation of gastric cancer, we monitored the behavior using proliferation, cell cycle, and flow cytometry analysis. Overexpression of LIF inhibited the gastric cancer cell cycle in the G1 phase. In our experiment, overexpression of LIF by lentivirus upregulated P21 and downregulated cyclin D1. Recombinant human LIF also downregulated P21 and cyclin D1 at various times. A further in vivo tumor formation study in nude mice indicated that overexpression of LIF in gastric cancer significantly delayed the progress of tumor formation. These findings indicate that LIF may serve as a negative regulator of gastric cancer.","['Xu, Guoxing', 'Wang, Haibin', 'Li, Weizheng', 'Xue, Zengfu', 'Luo, Qi']","['Xu G', 'Wang H', 'Li W', 'Xue Z', 'Luo Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0504-8789'],"['Department of Endoscopy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Xiamen Cancer Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment, Xiamen Cancer Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment, Xiamen Cancer Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, First Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, First Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Apr;234(4):3613-3620. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27083.

HTLV can be transmitted by whole-blood (WB) transfusion. The prevalence of HTLV among blood donor populations has not been characterized in Vietnam, although the screening has been partially implemented on voluntary basis since 2016. To determine the seroprevalence of HTLV-1/2 among blood donors, a total of 14,819 healthy blood donors in northern, central, and southern Vietnam and 1,003 samples from hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), anti-hepatitis C (anti-HCV), or HIV Ag/Ab reactive blood donors were screened for anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies by a chemiluminescence immunoassay using the Abbott ARCHITECT rHTLV-I/II assay. The anti-HTLV-1/2 repeat reactive (RR) samples were further tested by immunoblot (IB) method using MP Biomedicals HTLV Blot 2.4 for confirmation and differentiation of HTLV-1/2 infection. Proviral HTLV subgenomic amplification of the gag and tax regions was performed on the available WB RR samples (N = 11) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among 14,819 blood donors, 34 samples (0.23%) were RR for anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies, but only 1 case was confirmed HTLV-2 positive (0.0067%) and 5 cases were classified as indeterminate (0.034%) by IB. The RR rate was 0.39% among HBsAg/anti-HCV/HIV reactive sample groups, but none of them was confirmed by IB. Subgenomic PCR failed to amplify proviral DNA from WB samples of 11 RR samples. HTLV-1/2 prevalence was found to be low among blood donors in the study.

Primary immunodeficiencies affecting lymphocyte development or function therefore lead to severe infections and tumor susceptibility. Furthermore, the fact that autoimmunity is a frequent feature of primary immunodeficiencies reveals a third function of the adaptive immune system: its self-regulation. Indeed, the generation of a broad repertoire of antigen receptors (via a unique strategy of random somatic rearrangements of gene segments in T cell and B cell receptor loci) inevitably creates receptors with specificity for self-antigens and thus leads to the presence of autoreactive lymphocytes. There are many different mechanisms for controlling the emergence or action of autoreactive lymphocytes, including clonal deletion in the primary lymphoid organs, receptor editing, anergy, suppression of effector lymphocytes by regulatory lymphocytes, and programmed cell death. Here, we review the genetic defects affecting lymphocyte apoptosis and that are associated with lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity, together with the role of somatic mutations and their potential involvement in more common autoimmune diseases.","['Meynier, Sonia', 'Rieux-Laucat, Frederic']","['Meynier S', 'Rieux-Laucat F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7858-7866'],"['Laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Paris, France.', 'Imagine Institute, Paris Descartes-Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Paris, France.', 'Imagine Institute, Paris Descartes-Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/*genetics', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12720 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2019 Jan;287(1):50-61. doi: 10.1111/imr.12720.,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This engineered protein contains two parts, the immune part which is an antibody or cytokine, directed against the cancer cell receptor, and the toxin part consisting of a plant or bacterial toxin leading to apoptosis by protein synthesis inhibition. The knowledge of cell-surface receptor overexpression in cancer cells can help scientists to construct new anti-cancer agents. The granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor is expressed on the cell surface of some blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, this receptor can be used as an immunotoxin for treatment of some cancers. The aim of this work was to design and produce DT-GCSF immunotoxin using truncated DT fused to G-CSF. For fusion protein construction, DT389 and G-CSF fragments, were amplified by PCR using specific primers. A flexible linker SerGly4SerMet (SG4SM) was used to fuse the PCR products by SOEing PCR procedure to achieve an appropriate fusion protein, and the fused fragment was subcloned into pET21b. The new construction (pET-DT389GCSF) was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and the expression of the construction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting techniques. The data demonstrated the expression and purity rates of DT389GCSF about 25% and 90%, respectively.

Although the increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) makes appropriate antibiotic therapy difficult, clinical characteristics of enterococcal bacteremia and the impact of VRE infection on outcomes have rarely been reported in immunocompromised children. METHODS: We enrolled children and adolescents (< 19 years of age) with underlying malignancies who were diagnosed with enterococcal bacteremia during febrile neutropenia between 2010 and 2017. Medical records of the enrolled children were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of enterococcal bacteremia and impact of VRE infection on outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six episodes of enterococcal bacteremia were identified in 30 patients. VRE infection was identified in 11 episodes (30.6%); the 7- and 30-day mortalities were 27.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (50.0%) and acute myeloid leukemia (30.6%) were the most common underlying disorders. Three (8.3%) of the patients were in complete remission, and palliative and reinduction chemotherapies were administered in 47.2% and 36.1% of episodes, respectively. Empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriate in 64.0% of patients with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcal infection and in none of the VRE-infected patients (p = 0.001). However, the 30-day mortality was not significantly different between the two patient groups (44.0% vs. 45.5%, p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Most episodes of enterococcal bacteremia occurred in advanced stages of underlying malignancies, and still showed high mortality. The prognosis seemed to be related to the underlying disease condition rather than vancomycin resistance of the isolated enterococci, although the number of enrolled patients was small.","['Bae, Kil-Seong', 'Shin, Ju Ae', 'Kim, Seong Koo', 'Han, Seung Beom', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Jeong, Dae Chul', 'Kang, Jin Han']","['Bae KS', 'Shin JA', 'Kim SK', 'Han SB', 'Lee JW', 'Lee DG', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Jeong DC', 'Kang JH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1299-2137'],"[""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. beomsid@catholic.ac.kr."", 'The Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea. beomsid@catholic.ac.kr.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'The Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'The Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", 'The Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Neutropenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/*drug effects']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/08/31 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s15010-018-1260-z [doi]', '10.1007/s15010-018-1260-z [pii]']",ppublish,Infection. 2019 Jun;47(3):417-424. doi: 10.1007/s15010-018-1260-z.

Methods: Adult patients evaluated between January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2017, who presented with onset of LGS >/=10 years were identified. Data abstracted included age at seizure onset, seizure types, etiology, treatments, EEG and neuroimaging results, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and autoimmune evaluation. Results: Ten patients (8 females) were identified. The mean age at onset of seizures consistent with LGS was 16.5 years (range, 10-32 years). Seizure types included tonic, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures (all), myoclonic seizures (n = 3), and atypical absence seizures (n = 7). Five patients had normal intellectual function at onset. Prolonged video-EEG monitoring recorded seizures and generalized interictal epileptiform discharges in all. All patients had drug-resistant epilepsy (range of antiseizure drugs tried, 7-16). Two patients had a history of intrathecal methotrexate to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two patients had malformations of cortical development. CSF analysis (n = 5) showed a mild elevation in the protein level without other abnormalities. Autoantibody determinations in the serum (n = 4) or the CSF (n = 5) and genetic testing (n = 5) were negative. At final follow-up, all but 1 patient was disabled and required a caregiver, and none were driving. One patient died of probable sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conclusions: Late-onset LGS represents a rare, treatment-resistant generalized epilepsy that is disabling and may be associated with progressive cognitive impairment. The elevated CSF protein level in our cohort could have been due to high seizure burden but increases the possibility of an inflammatory component to the pathophysiology of this disorder.","['Smith, Kelsey M', 'Britton, Jeffrey W', 'Cascino, Gregory D']","['Smith KM', 'Britton JW', 'Cascino GD']",,"['Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Neurol Clin Pract,Neurology.

However, the clinical utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect MRD in AML remains unproven. We analysed the clinical significance of monitoring MRD using ultradeep NGS (NGS-MRD) and flow cytometry (FCM-MRD) in 137 samples obtained from 83 patients of NPM1 (mut) AML at the end of induction (PI) and consolidation (PC). We could monitor 12 different types of NPM1 mutations at a sensitivity of 0.001% using NGS-MRD. We demonstrated a significant correlation between NGS-MRD and real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Based upon a one log reduction between PI and PC time points we could classify patients as NGS-MRD positive (<1log reduction) or negative (>1log reduction). NGS-MRD, FCM-MRD as well as DNMT3A mutations were predictive of inferior overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS). On a multivariate analysis NGS-MRD emerged as an independent, most important prognostic factor predictive of inferior OS (hazard ratio, 3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58 to 8.37) and RFS (hazard ratio, 4.8; 95% CI:2.24 to 10.28).

Results: Eighty-four patients were included. The majority of patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 63). Sixty-one patients were in complete remission (AML n = 55). With a median follow up of 31 months (range: 5.7-74.1), 2-year overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survivals, relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/relapse free survival (GRFS) were 64.5% (53.8-75.2); 57.2% (46.2-68.2); 27.7% (18.2-37.9); 15.1% (8.2-23.9) and 43.6% (32.5-54.7), respectively. Considering AML in remission, 2-year OS, DFS, RI, NRM and GRFS were 74.2% (62-86.5); 66.8% (53.6-79.9); 23.4% (12.7-36); 9.8% (3.5-19.9) and 50.9% (36.9-64.9), respectively.

The multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MDR) has been widely applied to reduce multi-levels of genotypes into high or low risk groups. The Cox-MDR method has been proposed to detect gene-gene interactions associated with the survival phenotype by using the martingale residuals from a Cox model. However, this method requires a cross-validation procedure to find the best SNP pair among all possible pairs and the permutation procedure should be followed for the significance of gene-gene interactions. Recently, the unified model based multifactor dimensionality reduction method (UM-MDR) has been proposed to unify the significance testing with the MDR algorithm within the regression model framework, in which neither cross-validation nor permutation testing are needed. In this paper, we proposed a simple approach, called Cox UM-MDR, which combines Cox-MDR with the key procedure of UM-MDR to identify gene-gene interactions associated with the survival phenotype. Results: The simulation study was performed to compare Cox UM-MDR with Cox-MDR with and without the marginal effects of SNPs. We found that Cox UM-MDR has similar power to Cox-MDR without marginal effects, whereas it outperforms Cox-MDR with marginal effects and more robust to heavy censoring. We also applied Cox UM-MDR to a dataset of leukemia patients and detected gene-gene interactions with regard to the survival time. Conclusion: Cox UM-MDR is easily implemented by combining Cox-MDR with UM-MDR to detect the significant gene-gene interactions associated with the survival time without cross-validation and permutation testing. The simulation results are shown to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, which achieves at least the same power as Cox-MDR in most scenarios, and outperforms Cox-MDR when some SNPs having only marginal effects might mask the detection of the causal epistasis.","['Lee, Seungyeoun', 'Son, Donghee', 'Kim, Yongkang', 'Yu, Wenbao', 'Park, Taesung']","['Lee S', 'Son D', 'Kim Y', 'Yu W', 'Park T']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7941-8933'],"['1Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Sejong University, 209 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, 05006 South Korea.0000 0001 0727 6358grid.263333.4', '1Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Sejong University, 209 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, 05006 South Korea.0000 0001 0727 6358grid.263333.4', '2Department of Statistics, Seoul National University, Shilim-dong, Kwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-742 South Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', ""3Division of Oncology and Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.0000 0001 0680 8770grid.239552.a"", '2Department of Statistics, Seoul National University, Shilim-dong, Kwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-742 South Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BioData Min,BioData mining,101319161,,,,PMC6295107,,2018/12/20 06:00,2018/12/20 06:01,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13040-018-0189-1 [doi]', '189 [pii]']",epublish,BioData Min. 2018 Dec 14;11:27. doi: 10.1186/s13040-018-0189-1. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cox model', 'Gene-gene interaction', 'Multifactor dimensionality reduction method', 'Survival time', 'Unified model based method']",,,20181214,,"['Not applicableNot applicableThe authors declare that they have no competing', 'interestsSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in', 'published maps and institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of JAK/STAT signaling through mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL is central to myelofibrosis pathogenesis. JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, but are not curative and do not prevent leukemic transformation, defining a need to identify better therapeutic targets in myelofibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A short hairpin RNA library screening was performed on JAK2(V617F)-mutant HEL cells. Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (NCT) genes including RAN and RANBP2 were among top candidates. JAK2(V617F)-mutant cell lines, human primary myelofibrosis CD34(+) cells, and a retroviral JAK2(V617F)-driven myeloproliferative neoplasms mouse model were used to determine the effects of inhibiting NCT with selective inhibitors of nuclear export compounds KPT-330 (selinexor) or KPT-8602 (eltanexor). RESULTS: JAK2(V617F)-mutant HEL, SET-2, and HEL cells resistant to JAK inhibition are exquisitely sensitive to RAN knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition by KPT-330 or KPT-8602. Inhibition of NCT selectively decreased viable cells and colony formation by myelofibrosis compared with cord blood CD34(+) cells and enhanced ruxolitinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis, both in newly diagnosed and ruxolitinib-exposed myelofibrosis cells. Inhibition of NCT in myelofibrosis CD34(+) cells led to nuclear accumulation of p53. KPT-330 in combination with ruxolitinib-normalized white blood cells, hematocrit, spleen size, and architecture, and selectively reduced JAK2(V617F)-mutant cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate NCT as a potential therapeutic target in myelofibrosis and provide a rationale for clinical evaluation in ruxolitinib-exposed patients with myelofibrosis.","['Yan,

Here we used in vitro, in silico, and in vivo mouse xenograft model-based approaches to define the role of the Notch pathway in B-ALL chemosensitivity. We observed significant Notch receptor and ligand expression in B-ALL primary cells and cell lines. Primary leukemia cells from high-risk patients overexpressed Notch3, Notch4, and Jagged2 while displaying a reduction in expression levels of Notch1-4 following chemotherapy. We then analyzed in vitro cell survival of B-ALL cells treated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents alone or in combination with Notch signaling inhibitors. Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) and anti-Notch4 were all capable of potentiating drug-induced cell death in B-ALL cells by upregulating intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, which in turn modulated mTOR, NF-kappaB, and ERK expression. In NOG-mouse-based xenograft models of B-ALL, co-administration of the Notch inhibitor GSI-XII with the chemotherapeutic agent Ara-C lowered bone marrow leukemic burden compared with DMSO or Ara-C alone, thus prolonging mouse survival. Overall, our results support the potential effectiveness of Notch inhibitors in patients with B-ALL.Significance: Inhibition of Notch signaling enhances the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cells, suggesting Notch inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of patients with B-ALL.","['Takam Kamga, Paul', 'Dal Collo, Giada', 'Midolo, Martina', 'Adamo, Annalisa', 'Delfino, Pietro', 'Mercuri, Angela', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Mimiola, Elda', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Andreini, Angelo', 'Chilosi, Marco', 'Krampera, Mauro']","['Takam Kamga P', 'Dal Collo G', 'Midolo M', 'Adamo A', 'Delfino P', 'Mercuri A', 'Cesaro S', 'Mimiola E', 'Bonifacio M', 'Andreini A', 'Chilosi M', 'Krampera M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8586-1381', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0119-0830', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7280-2040']","['Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'EA4340-BCOH: Biomarker in Cancerology and Onco-Hematology, Universite de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Versailles, France.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Pathology, Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. mauro.krampera@univr.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-leucinal)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dipeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-1617 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1617 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Feb 1;79(3):639-649. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1617.

To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between HLA eplet-derived epitope mismatch (EM) and clinical outcome has not been examined in haplo-HCT. We retrospectively analyzed 148 patients who received a peripheral blood, T-cell-replete haplo-HCT with PTCy at a single center. HLA EM was quantified using an HLAMatchmaker-based method and was stratified by class and vector. The primary outcome was incidence of relapse. The total number of mismatched epitopes (MEs) per patient-donor pair in our patient population ranged from 0 to 51 (median, 24) in the graft-versus-host (GVH) direction and 0 to 47 (median, 24) in the host-versus-graft (HVG) direction. Higher HLA class II EM in the GVH direction was associated with a significantly reduced risk of relapse (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.952 per ME; P = .002) and improved relapse-free survival (adjusted HR, 0.974 per ME; P = .020). Higher HLA class II EM in the HVG direction was associated with longer time to neutrophil (adjusted HR, 0.974 per ME; P = .013) and platelet (adjusted HR, 0.961 per ME; P = .001) engraftment. In peripheral blood haplo-HCT patients, increased HLA EM was associated with a protective effect on the risk of relapse in the GVH direction but a negative effect on time to count recovery in the HVG direction. HLA EM based on the HLA Matchmaker represents a novel strategy to predict clinical outcome in haplo-HCT.","['Rimando, Joseph', 'Slade, Michael', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Gao, Feng', 'Liu, Chang', 'Romee, Rizwan']","['Rimando J', 'Slade M', 'DiPersio JF', 'Westervelt P', 'Gao F', 'Liu C', 'Romee R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4127-2091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1425-1623', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9077-4736']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO; and.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Transplantation, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['K12 HL087107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC6306877,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018025437 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025437 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Dec 26;2(24):3590-3601. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025437.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence indicates that dysregulation of the tumor suppressor tumor protein p53 (TP53) commonly occurs in the MPNs. The proteins MDM2 and MDM4 alter the cellular levels of TP53. We investigated in 1,294 patients whether abnormalities involving chromosomes 1 and 12, which harbor the genes for MDM4 and MDM2, respectively, and chromosome 17, where the gene for TP53 is located, are associated with MPN disease progression. Gain of 1q occurred not only in individuals with MPN-BP but also in patients with PV and ET, who, with further follow-up, eventually evolve to either MF and/or MPN-BP. These gains of 1q were most prevalent in patients with a history of PV and those who possessed the JAK2V617F driver mutation. The gains of 1q were accompanied by increased transcript levels of MDM4 In contrast, 12q chromosomal abnormalities were exclusively detected in patients who presented with MF or MPN-BP, but were not accompanied by further increases in MDM2/MDM4 transcript levels. Furthermore, all patients with a loss of 17p13, which leads to a deletion of TP53, had either MF or MPN-AP/BP. These findings suggest that gain of 1q, as well as deletions of 17p, are associated with perturbations of the TP53 pathway, which contribute to MPN disease progression.","['Marcellino, Bridget K', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Tripodi, Joseph', 'Lu, Min', 'Kosiorek, Heidi', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Rampal, Raajit K', 'Dueck, Amylou', 'Najfeld, Vesna']","['Marcellino BK', 'Hoffman R', 'Tripodi J', 'Lu M', 'Kosiorek H', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Rampal RK', 'Dueck A', 'Najfeld V']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8590-6175', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3033-1081', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8400-0483']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Division of Health Science Research, Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Health Science Research, Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6306879,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018024018 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024018 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Dec 26;2(24):3581-3589. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024018.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional antileukemia therapy has limited efficacy in this setting. Thus, MPN-AP/BP is an urgent unmet clinical need. Modest responses to hypomethylating agents and single-agent ruxolitinib have been reported. More recently, combination of ruxolitinib and decitabine has demonstrated synergistic in vitro activity in human and murine systems. These observations led us to conduct a phase 1 study to explore the safety of combined decitabine and dose-escalated ruxolitinib in patients with MPN-AP/BP. A total of 21 patients were accrued to this multicenter study. Ruxolitinib was administered at doses of 10, 15, 25, or 50 mg twice daily in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days) in 28-day cycles. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common reasons for study discontinuation were toxicity/adverse events (37%) and disease progression (21%). Fourteen patients died during study treatment period or follow-up. The median overall survival for patients on study was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval, 4.1-not reached). Among evaluable patients, the overall response rate by protocol-defined criteria (complete remission with incomplete count recovery + partial remission) was 9/17 (53%) and by intention-to-treat analysis was 9/21 (42.9%). The combination of decitabine and ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated by patients with MPN-AP/BP and demonstrates potentially promising clinical activity. A phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of this combination regimen is ongoing within the Myeloproliferative Disorder Research Consortium.","['Rampal, Raajit K', 'Mascarenhas, John O', 'Kosiorek, Heidi E', 'Price, Leah', 'Berenzon, Dmitriy', 'Hexner, Elizabeth', 'Abboud, Camille N', 'Kremyanskaya, Marina', 'Weinberg, Rona Singer', 'Salama, Mohamed E', 'Menghrajani, Kamal', 'Najfeld, Vesna', 'Sandy, Lonette', 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Dueck, Amylou C', 'Goldberg, Judith D', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Rampal RK', 'Mascarenhas JO', 'Kosiorek HE', 'Price L', 'Berenzon D', 'Hexner E', 'Abboud CN', 'Kremyanskaya M', 'Weinberg RS', 'Salama ME', 'Menghrajani K', 'Najfeld V', 'Sandy L', 'Heaney ML', 'Levine RL', 'Mesa RA', 'Dueck AC', 'Goldberg JD', 'Hoffman R']",,"['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'Division of Biostatistics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'New York Blood Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Mays Cancer Center, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX.', 'Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'Division of Biostatistics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA184746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Decitabine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitriles', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6306885,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018019661 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019661 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Dec 26;2(24):3572-3580. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019661.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase 2 hypothesis-generating trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) and single-agent maintenance therapy of 12 months is feasible and favorably influences event-free survival (EFS) compared with historical controls. Patients 18 to 70 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and centrally confirmed FLT3-ITD were eligible: 284 patients were treated, including 198 younger (18-60 years) and 86 older (61-70 years) patients. Complete remission (CR) rate, including CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi) after induction therapy, was 76.4% (younger, 75.8%; older, 77.9%). The majority of patients in CR/CRi proceeded to alloHCT (72.4%). Maintenance therapy was started in 97 patients (34%): 75 after alloHCT and 22 after consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC). Median time receiving maintenance therapy was 9 months after alloHCT and 10.5 months after HiDAC; premature termination was mainly a result of nonrelapse causes (gastrointestinal toxicity and infections). EFS and overall survival at 2 years were 39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%-47%) and 34% (95% CI, 24%-47%) and 53% (95% CI, 46%-61%) and 46% (95% CI, 35%-59%) in younger and older patients, respectively. EFS was evaluated in comparison with 415 historical controls treated within 5 prospective trials. Propensity score-weighted analysis revealed a significant improvement of EFS by midostaurin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.70; P < .001) overall and in older patients (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29-0.61).

We found, however, that FcepsilonRI signaling could occur in the presence or absence of receptor cross-linking. Using both cell and cell-free systems, we showed that FcepsilonRI signaling was stimulated by surface-associated monovalent ligands through the passive, size-dependent exclusion of the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase CD45 from plasma membrane regions of FcepsilonRI-ligand engagement. Similarly to the T cell receptor, FcepsilonRI signaling could also be initiated in a ligand-independent manner. These data suggest that a simple mechanism of CD45 exclusion-based receptor triggering could function together with cross-linking-based FcepsilonRI signaling, broadening mast cell and basophil reactivity by enabling these cells to respond to both multivalent and surface-presented monovalent antigens. These findings also strengthen the case that a size-dependent, phosphatase exclusion-based receptor triggering mechanism might serve generally to facilitate signaling by noncatalytic immune receptors.","['Felce, James H', 'Sezgin, Erdinc', 'Wane, Madina', 'Brouwer, Heather', 'Dustin, Michael L', 'Eggeling, Christian', 'Davis, Simon J']","['Felce JH', 'Sezgin E', 'Wane M', 'Brouwer H', 'Dustin ML', 'Eggeling C', 'Davis SJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5531-9244', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4915-388X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7647-0194', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3840-6834', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4983-6389', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3698-5599', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2280-1170']","['MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', 'Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7FY, UK.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', 'Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7FY, UK. simon.davis@imm.ox.ac.uk christian.eggeling@rdm.ox.ac.uk michael.dustin@kennedy.ox.ac.uk.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK. simon.davis@imm.ox.ac.uk christian.eggeling@rdm.ox.ac.uk michael.dustin@kennedy.ox.ac.uk.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK. simon.davis@imm.ox.ac.uk christian.eggeling@rdm.ox.ac.uk michael.dustin@kennedy.ox.ac.uk.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.']",['eng'],"['MC_UU_12010/4/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '098274/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00008/4/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12025/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '104924/14/Z/14/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '091911/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100262/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00008/9/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '107375/Z/15/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12010/9/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K01577X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (FCER1A protein, rat)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptprc protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['11/561/eaat0756 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.aat0756 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2018 Dec 18;11(561). pii: 11/561/eaat0756. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aat0756.,"['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Additional genomic aberrations are also crucial in both BCP-ALL leukemogenesis and treatment management. Herein, we report the phenotypic and molecular cytogenetic characterization of an extremely rare case of BCP-ALL harboring two concomitant leukemia-associated chromosome translocations: t(1;19)(q23;q13.3) and t(9;17)(p13;q11.2). Of note, we described a new rearrangement between exon 6 of PAX5 and a 17q11.2 region, where intron 3 of SPECC1 is located. This rearrangement seems to disrupt PAX5 similarly to a PAX5 deletion. Furthermore, a distinct karyotype between diagnosis and relapse samples was observed, disclosing a complex clonal evolution during leukemia progression. CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old boy was admitted febrile with abdominal and joint pain. At clinical investigation, he presented with anemia, splenomegaly, low white blood cell count and 92% lymphoblast. He was diagnosed with pre-B ALL and treated according to high risk GBTLI-ALL2009.

Loss of chromosomal regions carrying autophagy genes and decreased autophagy gene expression are characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Deficiency of autophagy proteins is also linked to an altered AML metabolic profile; altered metabolism has recently emerged as a potential druggable target in AML. Here, we sought to understand the mitochondria-specific changes that occur in leukemia cells after knockdown of BNIP3L/Nix or SQSTM1/p62, which are two autophagy genes involved in mitochondrial clearance and are downregulated in primary AML cells. Mitochondrial function, as measured by changes in endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential, was altered in leukemia cells deficient in these autophagy genes. Further, these AML cells were increasingly sensitive to mitochondria-targeting drugs while displaying little change in sensitivity to DNA-targeting agents. These findings suggest that BNIP3L or SQSTM1 may be useful prognostic markers to identify AML patients suitable for mitochondria-targeted therapies.

(MS), Mentha pulegium L. (MP) and Mentha rotundifolia (L.) Huds (MR)) with biochemical methods on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages (a transformed macrophage cell line isolated from ascites of BALB/c mice infected by the Abelson leukemia virus). The total phenolic, flavonoid and carotenoid contents were determined with spectrophotometric methods. The antioxidant activities were quantified with the Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL(TM)), the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. The MS extract showed the highest total phenolic content, and the highest antioxidant capacity, while the MR extract showed the lowest total phenolic content and the lowest antioxidant capacity. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were quantified on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7KC; 20 microg/mL: 50 microM) associated or not for 24 h and 48 h with ethanolic mint extracts used at different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 microg/mL). Under treatment with 7KC, an important inhibition of cell growth was revealed with the crystal violet test. This side effect was strongly attenuated in a dose dependent manner with the different ethanolic mint extracts, mainly at 48 h. The most important cytoprotective effect was observed with the MS extract. In addition, the effects of ethanolic mint extracts on cytokine secretion (Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP)-1, Interferon (IFN)-Upsilon, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) were determined at 24 h on lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.2 microg/mL)-, 7KC (20 microg/mL)- and (7KC + LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Complex effects of mint extracts were observed on cytokine secretion. However, comparatively to LPS-treated cells, all the extracts strongly reduce IL-6 secretion and two of them (MP and MR) also decrease MCP-1 and TNF-alpha secretion. However, no anti-inflammatory effects were observed on 7KC- and (7KC + LPS)-treated cells. Altogether, these data bring new evidences on the potential benefits (especially antioxidant and cytoprotective properties) of Algerian mint on human health.","['Brahmi, Fatiha', 'Nury, Thomas', 'Debbabi, Meryam', 'Hadj-Ahmed, Samia', 'Zarrouk, Amira', 'Prost, Michel', 'Madani, Khodir', 'Boulekbache-Makhlouf, Lila', 'Lizard, Gerard']","['Brahmi F', 'Nury T', 'Debbabi M', 'Hadj-Ahmed S', 'Zarrouk A', 'Prost M', 'Madani K', 'Boulekbache-Makhlouf L', 'Lizard G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9332-4976', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6330-0172']","['Laboratoire de Biomathematique, Biochimie, Biophysique et Scientometrie, Faculte des Sciences de la Nature et de la Vie, Universite de Bejaia, Bejaia 06000, Algerie. fatiha.brahmi@univ-bejaia.dz.', ""Laboratoire Bio-peroxIL 'Biochimie du Peroxysome, Inflammation et Metabolisme Lipidique' EA 7270/Inserm, Faculte des Sciences Gabriel, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 6 Bd Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France. fatiha.brahmi@univ-bejaia.dz."", ""Laboratoire Bio-peroxIL 'Biochimie du Peroxysome, Inflammation et Metabolisme Lipidique' EA 7270/Inserm, Faculte des Sciences Gabriel, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 6 Bd Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France. thomas.nury@u-bourgogne.fr."", ""Laboratoire Bio-peroxIL 'Biochimie du Peroxysome, Inflammation et Metabolisme Lipidique' EA 7270/Inserm, Faculte des Sciences Gabriel, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 6 Bd Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France. debbabi.meryam55@gmail.com."", ""Lab-NAFS 'Nutrition-Alimentation Fonctionnelle & Sante Vasculaire', Universite Monastir, LR12ES05, Monastir 4000, Tunisie. debbabi.meryam55@gmail.com."", ""Laboratoire Bio-peroxIL 'Biochimie du Peroxysome, Inflammation et Metabolisme Lipidique' EA 7270/Inserm, Faculte des Sciences Gabriel, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 6 Bd Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France. hjsamia@yahoo.fr."", ""Lab-NAFS 'Nutrition-Alimentation Fonctionnelle & Sante Vasculaire', Universite Monastir, LR12ES05, Monastir 4000, Tunisie. hjsamia@yahoo.fr."", 'Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Sousse, Sousse 4000, Tunisie. zarroukamira@gmail.com.', 'Kirial International/Laboratoires Spiral, 21560 Couternon, France. michelprost.spiral@wanadoo.fr.', 'Laboratoire de Biomathematique, Biochimie, Biophysique et Scientometrie, Faculte des Sciences de la Nature et de la Vie, Universite de Bejaia, Bejaia 06000, Algerie. khodir.madani@univ-bejaia.dz.', 'Laboratoire de Biomathematique, Biochimie, Biophysique et Scientometrie, Faculte des Sciences de la Nature et de la Vie, Universite de Bejaia, Bejaia 06000, Algerie. lila.boulekbache@univ-bejaia.dz.', ""Laboratoire Bio-peroxIL 'Biochimie du Peroxysome, Inflammation et Metabolisme Lipidique' EA 7270/Inserm, Faculte des Sciences Gabriel, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 6 Bd Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France. gerard.lizard@u-bourgogne.fr.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,PMC6315783,,2018/12/20 06:00,2018/12/20 06:01,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/20 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox7120184 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox7120184 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2018 Dec 6;7(12). pii: antiox7120184. doi: 10.3390/antiox7120184.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['7-ketocholesterol', 'Mentha sp. ethanolic extracts', 'anti-inflammatory activity', 'antioxidant activity', 'carotenoids', 'cytoprotection', 'flavonoids', 'phenolic compounds']",,,20181206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human patients with advanced B-cell leukemia or lymphoma, infusions with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-lymphocytes have shown promising responses. However, the scientific and clinical development of cell-based therapies for dogs, who get cancer of similar types as humans, is lagging behind. One reason is that immune cells and their functionality in dogs are less well characterized, largely due a lack of canine-specific reagents to detect surface markers, and specific cytokines to isolate and expand their immune cells. This review summarizes the current status of canine cancer immunotherapies, with focus on autologous and allogeneic T-lymphocytes, as well as NK cells, and discusses potential initiatives that would allow therapies with canine immune cells to ""catch up"" with the advances in humans.","['Addissie, Selamawit', 'Klingemann, Hans']","['Addissie S', 'Klingemann H']",,"['Nantkwest Inc., Culver City, CA 99232, USA.

The mechanisms through which the HTLV-1 induces these diseases are still unclear, but they might rely on immune alterations. HAM/TSP is associated with an impaired production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, or CXCL10. ATLL is associated with high levels of IL-10 and TGF-beta. These immunosuppressive cytokines could promote a protumoral micro-environment. Moreover, HTLV-1 infection impairs the IFN-I production and signaling, and favors the IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 expression. This contributes both to immune escape and to infected cells proliferation. Here, we review the landscape of cytokine dysregulations induced by HTLV-1 infection and the role of these cytokines in the HTLV-1-associated diseases progression.","['Futsch, Nicolas', 'Prates, Gabriela', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Casseb, Jorge', 'Dutartre, Helene']","['Futsch N', 'Prates G', 'Mahieux R', 'Casseb J', 'Dutartre H']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3728-9621', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5129-6804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4553-2559', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2682-4302']","['Equipe Oncogenese Retrovirale, Equipe Labellisee <<FRM>>, CIRI-Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm U1111, CNRS UMR5308, Labex Ecofect, ENS Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. nicolas.futsch@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 05403-000, Brazil. gabrielaprates12@hotmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Dermatology and Immunodeficiencies, Department of Dermatology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, SP 01246-100, Brazil. gabrielaprates12@hotmail.com.', 'Equipe Oncogenese Retrovirale, Equipe Labellisee <<FRM>>, CIRI-Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm U1111, CNRS UMR5308, Labex Ecofect, ENS Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. renaud.mahieux@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 05403-000, Brazil. jcasseb10@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Dermatology and Immunodeficiencies, Department of Dermatology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, SP 01246-100, Brazil. jcasseb10@gmail.com.', 'Equipe Oncogenese Retrovirale, Equipe Labellisee <<FRM>>, CIRI-Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm U1111, CNRS UMR5308, Labex Ecofect, ENS Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France. helene.dutartre@ens-lyon.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (CXCL9 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL9/immunology', 'Chemokines/immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology/virology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",PMC6315340,,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['v10120691 [pii]', '10.3390/v10120691 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2018 Dec 5;10(12). pii: v10120691. doi: 10.3390/v10120691.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATLL', '*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*cytokines', '*immune system']",,,20181205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was diagnosed as gout due to acute arthritis of bilateral feet dorsum 2 years ago,but he didn't receive any standard treatment. 1 year ago,there were more and more joints evolved during the gout attack, and many subcutaneous nodules occurred. When he presented to our clinic 1 month ago,the urate acid level was as high as 715 mumol/L. Moreover, we could find bone erosion in the X rays of his hand and foot,as well as synovitis,double contour sign and tophus on the ultrasound examination. The diagnosis of gout was clearly and definitely. However, he had leukocytosis and thrombocytosis for 4 years in the past history, and the urate acid level was only 400 mumol/L at that time. He also had well-controlled hypertension. The family history was unremarkable. Furthermore, we found megalosplenia on his physical examination. The bone marrow examination showed myelofibrosis and JAK2 V617F gene was positive. He was diagnosed as primary myelofibrosis and treated with interferon-alpha, together with urate acid-lowing therapy (febuxostat 60 mg once daily). Following-up for 1 year,the dosage of febuxostat decreased to 40 mg once daily, and the patient didn't have gout attack again, some of the tophus diminished, and the urate acid level ranged from 400 to 500 mumol/L. Gout is a common disease in clinical practice,usually combined with metabolic syndrome,chronic renal failure and specific drugs using (diuretic and calcineurin inhibitors). However,it is relatively rare to see gout associated with myeloproliferative diseases, including polycythemia vera, primary thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelocytic leukemia. In these diseases, the turnover of nucleic acids is greatly augmented, and an excess of purine metabolites, including uric acid, is released. In the natural course of gout, the appearance of tophus from the first onset of arthritis usually takes several years. This patient only had one traditional risk factor, but his urate acid level was remarkably high and he developed tophus in a short term. After treatment of primary myelofibrosis, the symptom of gout partially alleviated. Careful physical examination and medical history taking lead to the diagnosis of secondary gout, which should be reminded in the daily practice.","['Ji, L L', 'Hao, Y J', 'Zhang, Z L']","['Ji LL', 'Hao YJ', 'Zhang ZL']",,"['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.']",['chi'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Previous studies showed that Leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16) reduced insulin stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes by impairing the IRS-1 signaling pathway. We explored the mechanism by which LRP16 promotes the inflammatory response. METHODS: We screened LRP16 induced proteins in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory response using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and analyzed the potential biological functions of these proteins using online bioinformatics tools. mRNA expression and protein expression of target genes were measured by real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 390 differentially expressed proteins were identified. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was the primary activated pathway in LRP16-expressing cells. Overexpression of LRP16 activated ERK1/2 and Rac1, which are two key players related to the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, knock down of endogenous LRP16 by RNA interference (RNAi) reduced Rac1 expression, ERK activation, and inflammatory cytokine expression in human adipocytes stimulated by LPS. The stimulatory effect of LRP16 was diminished by suppressing Rac1 expression and treating the cells with the ERK specific inhibitor, PD98059. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed the functions of LRP16 in promoting the inflammatory response through activating the Rac1-MAPK1/ERK pathway in human adipocytes.","['Zang, Li', 'Hong, Quan', 'Yang, Guoqing', 'Gu, Weijun', 'Wang, Anping', 'Dou, Jingtao', 'Mu, Yiming', 'Wu, Di', 'Lyu, Zhaohui']","['Zang L', 'Hong Q', 'Yang G', 'Gu W', 'Wang A', 'Dou J', 'Mu Y', 'Wu D', 'Lyu Z']",,"['Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Kidney, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Kidney, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, Chinametabolism301@126.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adipocytes', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cell Line', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*immunology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*immunology']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000495931 [pii]', '10.1159/000495931 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2018;51(6):2591-2603. doi: 10.1159/000495931.

These structures have been shown to transport protons through lipid membranes and mitochondria. Conjugation of carboranes to various organic moieties is aimed at obtaining biologically active compounds with novel properties. Taking advantage of 1,2,3-triazoles as the scaffolds valuable in medicinal chemistry, we synthesized 1-(o-carboranylmethyl)-4-pentyl-1,2,3-triazole (c-triazole) and 1-(o-carboranylmethyl)-4-pentyl-1,2,3-triazolium iodide (c-triazolium). Both compounds interacted with model lipid membranes and exhibited a proton carrying activity in planar bilayers and liposomes in a concentration- and pH-dependent manner. Importantly, mechanisms of the protonophoric activity differed; namely, protonation-deprotonation reactions of the triazole and the o-carborane moieties were involved in the transport cycles of c-triazole and c-triazolium, respectively. At micromolar concentrations, c-triazole and c-triazolium stimulated respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria and depolarized their membrane potential, with c-triazole being more potent. In living K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) cells, both c-triazolium and c-triazole altered the mitochondrial membrane potential as determined by a decreased intracellular accumulation of the potential-dependent dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. Finally, cell viability testing demonstrated a cytotoxic potency of c-triazolium and, to a lesser extent, of c-triazole against K562 cells, whereas non-malignant fibroblasts were much less sensitive. In all tests, the reference boron-free benzyl-4-pentyl-1,2,3-triazole showed little-to-no effects. These results demonstrated that carboranyltriazoles carry protons across biological membranes, a property potentially important in anticancer drug design.","['Rokitskaya, Tatyana I', 'Khailova, Ljudmila S', 'Makarenkov, Anton V', 'Shunaev, Alexei V', 'Tatarskiy, Victor V', 'Shtil, Alexander A', ""Ol'shevskaya, Valentina A"", 'Antonenko, Yuri N']","['Rokitskaya TI', 'Khailova LS', 'Makarenkov AV', 'Shunaev AV', 'Tatarskiy VV', 'Shtil AA', ""Ol'shevskaya VA"", 'Antonenko YN']",,"['Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation.

Studies show its potent anti-neoplastic effects against leukemia cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential therapeutic effect of Fur A against colorectal cancer (CRC), and elucidate the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine cell, and TUNEL and Annexin-V/PI staining was used to detect apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution. The expression levels of specific proteins in the CRC cells were analyzed by Western blotting. A xenograft model was also established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Fur A in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: Fur A suppressed proliferation, blocked cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis and promoted autophagy in CRC cells. Interestingly, Fur A-induced autophagy functioned not only as a survival mechanism against apoptosis but also intensified the cell cycle arrest in CRC cells. In addition, Fur A mediated its effects via the inactivation of the STAT3/Mcl-1 axis. SIGNIFICANCE: Fur A is a promising drug candidate for the treatment and prevention of CRC.","['Ma, Zhao', 'Bao, Xuebin', 'Gu, Junbao']","['Ma Z', 'Bao X', 'Gu J']",,"[""Gastrointestinal Surgery Department, The People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University (People's Hospital of Henan Province), Zhengzhou, China."", ""Gastrointestinal Surgery Department, The People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University (People's Hospital of Henan Province), Zhengzhou, China.

METHODS: Twenty-three CSF cytospin specimens from 13 pediatric patients with ALL were included. iFISH probes detecting BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, and KMT2A rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion, which were present at initial diagnosis, were used on follow-up CSF cytospin specimens and were compared with cytology. RESULTS: Seventeen (73.9%) follow-up specimens showed concordant results between iFISH and cytology. Two (8.7%) samples with discordant results were positive by iFISH but not by cytology; one (4.3%) was positive only by cytology. In the remaining three (13.0%) specimens, too few cells were available for cytology, whereas iFISH interpretation was possible. CONCLUSIONS: iFISH of CSF cytospin preparations improves malignant cell detection in pediatric ALL.","['Hwang, Sang Mee', 'Park, Hee Sue', 'Park, Seungman', 'Kim, Sung-Min', 'Hong, Kyung Taek', 'Chang, Yoon Hwan', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Hwang SM', 'Park HS', 'Park S', 'Kim SM', 'Hong KT', 'Chang YH', 'Lee DS']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Korea.', 'Green Cross Reference Laboratory, Yong-In, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/pathology']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['5250888 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqy160 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Mar 1;151(4):416-423. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy160.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2018.

A vaccination campaign was instituted during 2003-2007 and no additional cases were recorded until 2010. During 2010-2016, six additional FeLV cases were documented. We characterized FeLV genomes isolated from Florida panthers from both outbreaks and compared them with full-length genomes of FeLVs isolated from contemporary Florida domestic cats. Phylogenetic analyses identified at least 2 circulating FeLV strains in panthers, which represent separate introductions from domestic cats. The original FeLV virus outbreak strain is either still circulating or another domestic cat transmission event has occurred with a closely related variant. We also report a case of a cross-species transmission event of an oncogenic FeLV recombinant (FeLV-B). Evidence of multiple FeLV strains and detection of FeLV-B indicate Florida panthers are at high risk for FeLV infection.","['Chiu, Elliott S', 'Kraberger, Simona', 'Cunningham, Mark', 'Cusack, Lara', 'Roelke, Melody', 'VandeWoude, Sue']","['Chiu ES', 'Kraberger S', 'Cunningham M', 'Cusack L', 'Roelke M', 'VandeWoude S']",,,['eng'],"['F30 OD023386/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 OD012201/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Emerg Infect Dis,Emerging infectious diseases,9508155,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary', 'Endangered Species', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Phylogeny', 'Puma/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology']",PMC6302599,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3201/eid2501.181347 [doi]'],ppublish,Emerg Infect Dis. 2019 Jan;25(1):92-101. doi: 10.3201/eid2501.181347.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*FeLV-B', '*Florida panther', '*Puma concolor coryi', '*domestic cats', '*endangered species', '*feline leukemia virus', '*outbreak', '*viruses', '*zoonoses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the potential priming effects of preconception exposure of PM 2.5 on cardiac function in adult offspring. Methods and Results Male and female friend leukemia virus b (FVB) mice were exposed to either filtered air ( FA ) or PM 2.5 at an average concentration of 38.58 mug/m(3) for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 months. Mice were then crossbred into 2 groups: (1) FA malex FA female (both parents were exposed to FA preconception) and, (2) PM 2.5malex PM 2.5female (both parents were exposed to PM 2.5 preconception). Male offspring were divided: (1) preconception FA (offspring born to FA exposed parents) and, (2) preconception PM 2.5 (offspring born to PM 2.5 exposed parents) and analyzed at 3 months of age. Echocardiography identified increased left ventricular end systolic volume and reduced posterior wall thickness, reduced %fractional shortening and %ejection fraction in preconception PM 2.5 offspring. Cardiomyocytes isolated from preconception PM 2.5 offspring showed reduced %peak shortening, -dL/dT, TPS 90 and slower calcium reuptake (tau). Gene and protein expression revealed modifications in markers of inflammation ( IL -6, IL -15, TNF alpha, NF B, CRP , CD 26E, CD 26P, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) profibrosis (collagen type III alpha 1 chain), oxidative stress ( NOS 2), antioxidants (Nrf2, SOD , catalase), Ca(2+) regulatory proteins ( SERCA 2a, p- PLN , NCX ), and epigenetic regulators (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Sirt1, and Sirt2) in preconception PM 2.5 offspring. Conclusions Preconception exposure to PM 2.5 results in global cardiac dysfunction in adult offspring, suggesting that abnormalities during development are not limited to the prenatal or postnatal periods but can also be determined before conception.","['Tanwar, Vineeta', 'Adelstein, Jeremy M', 'Grimmer, Jacob A', 'Youtz, Dane J', 'Katapadi, Aashish', 'Sugar, Benjamin P', 'Falvo, Michael J', 'Baer, Lisa A', 'Stanford, Kristin I', 'Wold, Loren E']","['Tanwar V', 'Adelstein JM', 'Grimmer JA', 'Youtz DJ', 'Katapadi A', 'Sugar BP', 'Falvo MJ', 'Baer LA', 'Stanford KI', 'Wold LE']",,"['1 Dorothy M.

Utilizing peripheral blood (PB) instead of BM might be favorable, but data on its usefulness are scarce. PROCEDURE: We investigated 1303 PB samples (days 0, 8, 15, 33, and 52) and 285 BMs (day 15) from 288 pediatric ALL patients treated in trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000. MRD was assessed by four-color flow cytometry and evaluated as relative, absolute, and kinetic result. RESULTS: In B-ALL only, PB measures from early time points correlated with relapse incidence (CIR). Best separation occurred at threshold <1 blast/muL at day 8 (5-year CIR 0.02 +/- 0.02 vs 0.12 +/- 0.03; P = 0.044). Patients with highest relapse risk were not distinguishable, but PB-MRD at days 33 and 52 correlated with prednisone response and postinduction BM-MRD by PCR (P < 0.001). Kinetic assessment did not convey any advantage. In multivariate analysis including day 15 BM-MRD, PB-MRD measures lost statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, PB-MRD in pediatric B-ALL correlates with outcome and risk parameters, but its prognostic significance is not strong enough to substitute for BM assessment in AIEOP-BFM trials. It might, however, be valuable in treatment environments not using multifaceted risk stratification with other MRD measures.","['Schumich, Angela', 'Maurer-Granofszky, Margarita', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Printz, Dieter', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Mann, Georg', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Dworzak, Michael N']","['Schumich A', 'Maurer-Granofszky M', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Potschger U', 'Buldini B', 'Gaipa G', 'Karawajew L', 'Printz D', 'Ratei R', 'Conter V', 'Schrappe M', 'Mann G', 'Basso G', 'Dworzak MN']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3519-9972', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9285-6898', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8175-1097']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tettamanti Research Center, University of Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Roessle-Clinic at the HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Hemato-Oncology, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27590 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 May;66(5):e27590. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27590.

However, high treatment adherence is necessary for successful treatment with BCR-ABL inhibitors. Therefore, an adequate understanding of the adverse event profiles of BCR-ABL inhibitors is essential. Although many adverse events are observed in trials, an accurate identification of adverse events based only on clinical trial results is difficult because of strict entry criteria or limited follow-up durations. In particular, BCR-ABL inhibitor-induced impaired glucose metabolism remains controversial. Pharmacovigilance evaluations using spontaneous reporting systems are useful for analyzing drug-related adverse events in clinical settings. Therefore, we conducted signal detection analyses for BCR-ABL inhibitor-induced impaired glucose metabolism by using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Signals for an increased reporting rate of impaired glucose metabolism were detected only for nilotinib use, whereas these signals were not detected for other BCR-ABL inhibitors. Subgroup analyses showed a clearly increased nilotinib-associated reporting rate of impaired glucose metabolism in male and younger patients. Although FAERS- and JADER-based signal detection analyses cannot determine causality perfectly, our study suggests the effects on glucose metabolism are different between BCR-ABL inhibitors and provides useful information for the selection of appropriate BCR-ABL inhibitors.","['Okada, Naoto', 'Niimura, Takahiro', 'Zamami, Yoshito', 'Hamano, Hirofumi', 'Ishida, Shunsuke', 'Goda, Mitsuhiro', 'Takechi, Kenshi', 'Chuma, Masayuki', 'Imanishi, Masaki', 'Ishizawa, Keisuke']","['Okada N', 'Niimura T', 'Zamami Y', 'Hamano H', 'Ishida S', 'Goda M', 'Takechi K', 'Chuma M', 'Imanishi M', 'Ishizawa K']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2476-9191'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Tokushima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Tokushima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Clinical Trial Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Clinical Trial Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Tokushima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC6346261,,2018/12/19 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1920 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Jan;8(1):174-181. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1920.

METHODS: Inclusion criteria consisted of >/=18 years of age, sAML, first CBT between 2002 and 2016, and either first complete remission (CR) or active disease at CBT. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six patients met the study inclusion criteria. Status at transplantation was first CR (n = 97), primary refractory sAML (n = 30) or relapsed (n = 19) sAML. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 118 patients while the remaining 25 patients (17%) failed to engraft. This includes 13% of patients transplanted in first CR versus 30% of those transplanted with active disease (P = 0.008). Two-year incidences of relapse were 25% in first CR patients versus 36% in those with advanced disease (P = 0.06) while 2-year incidences of nonrelapse mortality were 35% and 49% (P = 0.03), respectively.

Initial clinical findings included ionized hypercalcemia with an apparent marked increase in parathyroid hormone, thrombocytopenia, and nonregenerative anemia. Low numbers of circulating atypical cells were noted on blood film evaluation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging identified an extra-axial contrast enhancing subtentorial lesion, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis documented a marked atypical lymphocytic pleocytosis. Flow cytometry performed on the CSF demonstrated expression of only CD45, CD90, and MHC class II, with Pax5 positivity on subsequent immunohistochemistry. The final diagnosis was of B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma or acute leukemia, given the distribution of disease and the presence of significant bone marrow infiltration alongside an aggressive clinical course. The unusual immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells and hypercalcemia presented antemortem diagnostic challenges, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach and caution in the interpretation of clinical abnormalities in cases with multiple comorbidities.","['Hare, Cassia H Z', 'Archer, Joy', 'Cloup, Emilie', 'Genain, Marie-Aude', 'Hughes, Katherine', 'McCallum, Katie E', 'Alves, Lisa']","['Hare CHZ', 'Archer J', 'Cloup E', 'Genain MA', 'Hughes K', 'McCallum KE', 'Alves L']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9306-4796', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3331-1249', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6153-0687']","[""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Hypercalcemia/*veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocytosis/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/*veterinary', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography/veterinary', 'Myoclonus/*veterinary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*veterinary']",PMC6430899,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jvim.15398 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2019 Mar;33(2):856-861. doi: 10.1111/jvim.15398.

Here we investigate how mesoderm specifies into blood-fated cells. We document temporally restricted co-expression of blood (Scl/Tal1), cardiac (Mesp1) and paraxial (Tbx6) lineage-affiliated transcription factors in single cells, at the onset of blood specification, supporting the existence of common progenitors. At the same time-restricted stage, absence of SCL results in expansion of cardiac/paraxial cell populations and increased cardiac/paraxial gene expression, suggesting active suppression of alternative fates. Indeed, SCL normally activates expression of co-repressor ETO2 and Polycomb-PRC1 subunits (RYBP, PCGF5) and maintains levels of Polycomb-associated histone marks (H2AK119ub/H3K27me3). Genome-wide analyses reveal ETO2 and RYBP co-occupy most SCL target genes, including cardiac/paraxial loci. Reduction of Eto2 or Rybp expression mimics Scl-null cardiac phenotype. Therefore, SCL-mediated transcriptional repression prevents mis-specification of blood-fated cells, establishing active repression as central to fate determination processes.","['Chagraoui, Hedia',

This raised the question as to whether cell phenotypes also differed among MT-2 cell lines. The influence of two different MT-2 cell lines (MT-2J and MT-2B) on the growth of the promonocytic leukemia cell line, U937, was investigated. Protein levels and mRNA expression of cytokines were also investigated. In addition, Western blot analysis of HTLV-1 regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ, was also performed. Culture supernatant from MT-2B, but not MT-2J, cells showed marked suppressive effects on U937 cell growth. MT-2B showed high tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-beta, and interferon (IFN)-gamma both in protein levels of the culture supernatant and mRNA levels of the cells. Analysis using recombinant cytokines indicated that the suppressive effects of MT-2B were due, at least in part, to high levels of TNF-beta and its synergic effects with IFN-gamma in the culture supernatant. Protein levels of HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ were higher in MT-2B than those in MT-2J cells. These molecules have been reported to affect the cytokine production of HTLV-1 infected cells; therefore, the difference in these molecules may have accounted for the differences in cytokine production between MT-2J and MT-2B cells. Furthermore, because MT-2 cells showed a large variation of integrated HTLV-1 proviruses as well as cell phenotypes, it is important to exercise caution in the assessment and interpretation of experimental data from MT-2 cells.","['Nomura, Hajime', 'Umekita, Kunihiko', 'Hashikura, Yuuki', 'Umeki, Kazumi', 'Yamamoto, Ikuo', 'Aratake, Yatsuki', 'Saito, Mineki', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Okayama, Akihiko']","['Nomura H', 'Umekita K', 'Hashikura Y', 'Umeki K', 'Yamamoto I', 'Aratake Y', 'Saito M', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Okayama A']",,"['Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. kunihiko_umekita@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Life Medical, Kyushu University of Health and Welfare, 1714-1 Yoshino, Nobeoka, Miyazaki, 882-8508, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13577-018-00231-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13577-018-00231-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2019 Apr;32(2):185-192. doi: 10.1007/s13577-018-00231-3.

Axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel are the first-in-class anti-CD19 CAR-T currently available for relapsed/refractory adult large B-cell lymphoma. Tisagenlecleucel is also available for pediatric and young adult (up to age 25 years) patients with relapsed/refractory B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and CAR-T-associated encephalopathy syndrome (neurotoxicity) are the most common adverse effects associated with CAR-T therapy. They can lead to significant morbidity and preclude widespread use of this treatment modality. Treatment-related deaths from severe CRS and cerebral edema have been reported. There is a significant heterogeneity in the side-effect profile of different CAR-T products under investigation and there is a need to develop standardized guidelines for toxicity grading and management. Here, we summarize the current literature on pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of CRS and neurotoxicity. The different grading systems of CRS and management protocols used in different trials have made it difficult to compare the outcomes of different CAR-T therapies. Several prevention strategies such as predictive biomarkers of CRS and neurotoxicity and modified CAR-T with 'built-in' safety mechanisms are being studied, with the potential to greatly expand the safety and applicability of CAR-T treatment across various malignancies.","['Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai R', 'Bachmeier, Christina A', 'Locke, Frederick']","['Dholaria BR', 'Bachmeier CA', 'Locke F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-6691'],"['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, FOB-3, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, FOB-3, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA. frederick.Locke@moffitt.org.']",['eng'],"['K23 CA201594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA201594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA076292-18S4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'I031V2H011 (tocilizumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC6733400,['NIHMS1516882'],2018/12/19 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40259-018-0324-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40259-018-0324-z [pii]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2019 Feb;33(1):45-60. doi: 10.1007/s40259-018-0324-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study describes the proportion of survivors seen for an initial survivor clinic visit within a large pediatric oncology program. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with non-central nervous system childhood malignancies from 2007 to 2012 were followed from the time of survivor clinic eligibility (2 years following completion of therapy) through their initial survivor clinic visit or end of study. Demographic, cancer-related, and logistical factors related to clinic attendance were examined using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional regressions. RESULTS: Eligible survivors were 53.0% male, 51.5% non-Hispanic white, and 30.9% survivors of leukemia. Among the 866 eligible survivors for this study, 610 (70.4%) completed their initial visit. After controlling for sex and time eligible, survivors who received surgery only (aHR 0.04 (0.02, 0.08)) or radiation only (0.24 (0.15, 0.39)) and who had Medicaid (0.77 (0.64, 0.92)) were significantly less likely to have an initial visit as were those of black or other/mixed race and those who lived > 25 mi from the clinic (p < 0.01). Survivors aged 6-11 years or 12-17 years at eligibility were significantly more likely to complete an initial visit as compared to those aged 2-5 years (1.55 (1.24, 1.93) and 1.44 (1.14, 1.83), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a third of survivors were not seen in a pediatric survivor clinic despite the importance of survivor care. These results identify populations at risk for not pursuing long-term survivorship care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Failure to transition to pediatric survivor care may lead to lifelong non-engagement and incorrect perceptions about future health.","['Daly, Ashley', 'Lewis, Rebecca Williamson', 'Vangile, Kristen', 'Masker, Karen Wasilewski', 'Effinger, Karen E', 'Meacham, Lillian R', 'Mertens, Ann C']","['Daly A', 'Lewis RW', 'Vangile K', 'Masker KW', 'Effinger KE', 'Meacham LR', 'Mertens AC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0989-0962'],"['Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Behavioral Health, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Boise, ID, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, 2015 Uppergate Dr, 4th Floor, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, 2015 Uppergate Dr, 4th Floor, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, 2015 Uppergate Dr, 4th Floor, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA. amerten@emory.edu.', ""Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. amerten@emory.edu."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, 2015 Uppergate Dr, 4th Floor, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA. amerten@emory.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Ambulatory Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cancer Survivors/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Long-Term Care/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Patient Participation/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivorship', 'Transition to Adult Care/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11764-018-0727-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-018-0727-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2019 Feb;13(1):56-65. doi: 10.1007/s11764-018-0727-3.

JAK3 associates with the common gamma chain (gammac) receptor and functions in a heteromeric signaling pair with JAK1. In IL-2 signaling JAK1 is the effector kinase for STAT5 phosphorylation but the precise molecular regulatory mechanisms of JAK1 and JAK3 and their individual domains are not known. The pseudokinase domain (JAK homology 2, JH2) of JAK3 is of particular interest as approximately half of clinical JAK3 mutations cluster into it. In this study, we investigated the role of JH2s of JAK1 and JAK3 in IL-2R signaling and show that STAT5 activation requires both JH1 and JH2 of JAK1, while both JH1 and JH2 in JAK3 are specifically required for the cytokine-induction of cellular signaling. Characterization of recombinant JAK3 JH2 in thermal shift assay shows an unstable protein domain, which is strongly stabilized by ATP binding. Unexpectedly, nucleotide binding to JAK3 JH2 was found to be cation-independent. JAK3 JH2 showed higher nucleotide binding affinity in MANT-ATP and fluorescent polarization competition assays compared to the other JAK JH2s. Analysis of the functional role of ATP binding in JAK3 JH2 in cells and in zebrafish showed that disruption of ATP binding suppresses ligand-independent activation of clinical JAK3 gain-of-function mutations residing in either JH2 or JH1 but does not inhibit constitutive activation of oncogenic JAK1. ATP-binding site mutations in JAK3 JH2 do not, however, abrogate normal IL-2 signaling making them distinct from JH2 deletion or kinase-deficient JAK3. These findings underline the importance of JAK3 JH2 for cellular signaling in both ligand-dependent and in gain-of-function mutation-induced activation. Furthermore, they identify the JH2 ATP-binding site as a key regulatory region for oncogenic JAK3 signaling, and thus a potential target for therapeutic modulation.","['Raivola, Juuli', 'Hammaren, Henrik M', 'Virtanen, Anniina T', 'Bulleeraz, Vilasha', 'Ward, Alister C', 'Silvennoinen, Olli']","['Raivola J', 'Hammaren HM', 'Virtanen AT', 'Bulleeraz V', 'Ward AC', 'Silvennoinen O']",,"['Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Molecular and Medical Research, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Molecular and Medical Research, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Fimlab Laboratories, Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6287396,,2018/12/19 06:00,2018/12/19 06:01,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00560 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Dec 3;8:560. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00560. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK kinase', 'cytokine', 'leukemia', 'nucleotide binding', 'pseudokinase']",,,20181203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First case of Mycobacterium abscessus presenting as retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with severe hypercalcemia: a case report and literature review.,331-338,10.1080/20009666.2018.1539057 [doi],"Background: Nontuberculous mycobacterium is a recognized cause of hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Here we describe a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) in a patient with AIDS. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report describing a case of M. abscessus presenting as retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and severe hypercalcemia. Case description: A 56-year-old man with AIDS presented with altered mental status and somnolence for four days. Laboratory investigations were significant for calcium 16.49 mg/dL (RI 8.9-10.3 mg/dL), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level 44.1 pg/ml (RI 19.9-79.3 pg/ml) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 4 pg/mL (RI 15-65 pg/mL). CT scan of Abdomen and Pelvis showed hepatosplenomegaly with large retroperitoneal, retrocrural, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy which had an intense focal uptake on Gallium scan. Bone marrow biopsy revealed mild plasmacytosis (5%) with no evidence of myelodysplasia, acute leukemia or lymphoma. A subsequent lymph node biopsy showed fragments of fibrous tissue with lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and many acid-fast bacilli. Pre-antibiotic blood cultures grew Mycobacterium which was identified later as M. abscessus at four weeks. Conclusion: hypercalcemia in HIV-infected patients may suggest malignancy or infectious etiology, among other causes. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of hypercalcemia with nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection, whether as first manifestation or a late presenter in the disease course after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). We suggest careful monitoring of serum calcium level upon diagnosis of NTM infection and after initiation of ART, NTM therapy or vitamin D supplementation.","['Abdulfattah, Omar', 'Rahman, Ebad Ur', 'Shweta, Fnu', 'Datar, Praveen', 'Alnafoosi, Zainab', 'Trauber, David', 'Sam, Mirela', 'Enriquez, Danilo', 'Schmidt, Frances']","['Abdulfattah O', 'Rahman EU', 'Shweta F', 'Datar P', 'Alnafoosi Z', 'Trauber D', 'Sam M', 'Enriquez D', 'Schmidt F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7092-3631', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6634-6272', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2913-9706', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7511-5203']","['Medicine Department, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Hematology/Oncology Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Infection disease Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Medicine Department, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Interfaith Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Community Hosp Intern Med Perspect,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,101601396,,,,PMC6292348,,2018/12/19 06:00,2018/12/19 06:01,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/20009666.2018.1539057 [doi]', '1539057 [pii]']",epublish,J Community Hosp Intern Med Perspect. 2018 Dec 11;8(6):331-338. doi: 10.1080/20009666.2018.1539057. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Nontuberculous mycobacterium', 'hypercalcemia', 'immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome', 'retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy']",,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous miRNAs promote tumorigenesis, while others have a tumour suppressive effects. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of genetically diverse hematopoietic malignancies with variable response to treatment. AIM: Our study aimed to investigate the possible role of miR-150 in de novo adult AML and the impact of its level on survival, and we used in the silicon analysis to predict the main target genes involved in miR-150 mediated cancer pathway. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated miR-150 expression profiling assay using TaqMan primer probes RT-PCR in the plasma of 50 adult AML patients, before the start of treatment and at day 28 of treatment, along with 20 normal adult control samples. miR-16 was used as an endogenous reference for standardisation. Follow-up of patients during treatment at day 28 of induction chemotherapy and after one year was done. RESULTS: In this study, we found a significantly lower level of miR-150 in AML patients when compared to controls (p = 0.005) with 0.62 fold change than in healthy controls. Patients were divided into two groups: the low miR-150 group (miR-150 < 1) and the high miR-150 group (miR-150 > 1). A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding initial total leukocytic count and initial PB blast count while for the TLC, HB and PLT count at follow up. No difference in the overall survival between the low and the high miR-150 groups could be demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-150 functions as a tumour suppressor and gatekeeper in inhibiting cell transformation and that its downregulation is required for leukemogenesis.","['Abdelhalim, Dalia A', 'Elgamal, Basma M', 'ElKafoury, Mona R', 'Hassan, Naglaa M', 'Hussein, Marwa M', 'Elhefnawi, Mahmoud M', 'Elfiky, Asmaa M', 'Nabil, Mohamed']","['Abdelhalim DA', 'Elgamal BM', 'ElKafoury MR', 'Hassan NM', 'Hussein MM', 'Elhefnawi MM', 'Elfiky AM', 'Nabil M']",,"['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Medical Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Medical Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Informatics and System Department, Engineering Research Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Environmental and Occupational Medicine Department, Environmental Research Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Medical Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC6290449,,2018/12/19 06:00,2018/12/19 06:01,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2018.420 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-6-1993 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2018 Nov 19;6(11):1993-2000. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.420. eCollection 2018 Nov 25.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'biomarkers', 'leukemogenesis', 'miR-150', 'microRNA']",,,20181119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As former work indicated the possible presence of the aGPCR GPR97 in granulocytes, we studied its cellular distribution, molecular structure, signal transduction, and biological function in PMNs. RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry revealed abundant RNA and protein expression of ADGRG3/GPR97 in granulocyte precursors and terminally differentiated neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic granulocytes. Using a newly generated GPR97-specific monoclonal antibody, we confirmed that endogenous GPR97 is a proteolytically processed, dichotomous, N-glycosylated receptor. GPR97 was detected in tissue-infiltrating PMNs and upregulated during systemic inflammation. Antibody ligation of GPR97 increased neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and proteolytic enzyme activity, which is accompanied by an increase in mitogen-activated protein kinases and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. In-depth analysis of the GPR97 signaling cascade revealed a possible switch from basal Galphas/cAMP-mediated signal transduction to a Galphai-induced reduction in cAMP levels upon mutation-induced activation of the receptor, in combination with an increase in downstream effectors of Gbetagamma, such as SRE and NF-kappaB. Finally, ligation of GPR97 increased the bacteria uptake and killing activity of neutrophils. We conclude that the specific presence of GPR97 regulates antimicrobial activity in human granulocytes.","['Hsiao, Cheng-Chih', 'Chu, Tai-Ying', 'Wu, Chia-Jung', 'van den Biggelaar, Maartje', 'Pabst, Caroline', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Kuijpers, Taco W', 'Scicluna, Brendon P', 'I, Kuan-Yu', 'Chen, Tse-Ching', 'Liebscher, Ines', 'Hamann, Jorg', 'Lin, Hsi-Hsien']","['Hsiao CC', 'Chu TY', 'Wu CJ', 'van den Biggelaar M', 'Pabst C', 'Hebert J', 'Kuijpers TW', 'Scicluna BP', 'I KY', 'Chen TC', 'Liebscher I', 'Hamann J', 'Lin HH']",,"['Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Department of Plasma Proteins, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Leukemia Cell Bank of Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Department of Blood Cell Research, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Center for Experimental Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Rudolf Schonheimer Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (ADGRG3 protein, human)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",PMC6287011,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02830 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 3;9:2830. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02830. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*G-protein signaling', '*adhesion GPCR', '*antimicrobial activity', '*granulocytes', '*inflammation', '*monoclonal antibody']",,,20181203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.","['Long, Kristen B', 'Young, Regina M', 'Boesteanu, Alina C', 'Davis, Megan M', 'Melenhorst, J Joseph', 'Lacey, Simon F', 'DeGaramo, David A', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'Fraietta, Joseph A']","['Long KB', 'Young RM', 'Boesteanu AC', 'Davis MM', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Lacey SF', 'DeGaramo DA', 'Levine BL', 'Fraietta JA']",,"['Department of Biology, Mansfield University, Mansfield, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Mansfield University, Mansfield, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",PMC6287001,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02740 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Dec 3;9:2740. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02740. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cell', '*adoptive cell therapy', '*cancer', '*immunotherapy', '*microenvironment', '*non-hematopoietic malignancy', '*solid tumor']",,,20181203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, original numerical data are not available for the majority of the graphs presented in the paper. Although original data were available for most EMSA and immunoblot experiments, those corresponding to the published EMSA data of Supplementary Fig. 8a, the independent replicate immunoblots of Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 1e, and the independent replicate EMSA data of Supplementary Figs 6e, 8b, 8c and 8d, are unavailable.

High expression of Mcl-1 causes tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies highlighting the potential of Mcl-1 inhibitors as anticancer drugs. Here, we describe AZD5991, a rationally designed macrocyclic molecule with high selectivity and affinity for Mcl-1 currently in clinical development. Our studies demonstrate that AZD5991 binds directly to Mcl-1 and induces rapid apoptosis in cancer cells, most notably myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia, by activating the Bak-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. AZD5991 shows potent antitumor activity in vivo with complete tumor regression in several models of multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia after a single tolerated dose as monotherapy or in combination with bortezomib or venetoclax. Based on these promising data, a Phase I clinical trial has been launched for evaluation of AZD5991 in patients with hematological malignancies (NCT03218683).","['Tron, Adriana E', 'Belmonte, Matthew

CD19-specific CARs that comprise CD28 and CD3zeta signaling motifs(2) have induced remarkable responses in patients with refractory leukemia(3-5) and lymphoma(6) and were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration(7). These CARs program highly performing effector functions that mediate potent tumor elimination(4,8) despite the limited persistence they confer on T cells(3-6,8). Extending their functional persistence without compromising their potency should improve current CAR therapies. Strong T cell activation drives exhaustion(9,10), which may be accentuated by the redundancy of CD28 and CD3zeta signaling(11,12) as well as the spatiotemporal constraints imparted by the structure of second-generation CARs(2). Thus, we hypothesized that calibrating the activation potential of CD28-based CARs would differentially reprogram T cell function and differentiation. Here, we show that CARs encoding a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif direct T cells to different fates by balancing effector and memory programs, thereby yielding CAR designs with enhanced therapeutic profiles.","['Feucht, Judith', 'Sun, Jie', 'Eyquem, Justin', 'Ho, Yu-Jui', 'Zhao, Zeguo', 'Leibold, Josef', 'Dobrin, Anton', 'Cabriolu, Annalisa', 'Hamieh, Mohamad', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Feucht J', 'Sun J', 'Eyquem J', 'Ho YJ', 'Zhao Z', 'Leibold J', 'Dobrin A', 'Cabriolu A', 'Hamieh M', 'Sadelain M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9031-8025'],"['Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University & Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Zhejing, China.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. m-sadelain@ski.mskcc.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calibration', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Lineage', '*Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Domains', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC6532069,['NIHMS1007041'],2018/12/19 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-018-0290-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-018-0290-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2019 Jan;25(1):82-88. doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0290-5.

Because DNA repair is the major molecular shift that alters sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, we explored whether activation of the NF-kappaB pathway promotes AML cell survival by regulating DNA repair after chemotherapy. Our results showed that RELA, an important subunit of NF-kappaB, regulated DNA repair by binding to the promoter region of the PARP1 gene and affecting PARP1 gene transcription. Conversely, PARP1 knockdown reduced NF-kappaB activity, indicating that NF-kappaB and PARP1 create a positive feedback loop in DNA repair. Simultaneous treatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor BMS-345541 and the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib resulted in robust killing of AML cells. This dual inhibition significantly suppressed tumor growth and extended survival times in xenograft tumor models. IMPLICATIONS: RELA and PARP1 form a positive feedback loop to regulate DNA damage repair, simultaneous inhibition of NF-kappaB and PARP1 increases the antileukemic efficacy of daunorubicin in vitro and in vivo, broadening the use of PARP1 inhibitors.","['Li, Ding', 'Luo, Yufei', 'Chen, Xianling', 'Zhang, LingYu', 'Wang, Tingting', 'Zhuang, Yingting', 'Fan, Yingjuan', 'Xu, Jianhua', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Wu, Lixian']","['Li D', 'Luo Y', 'Chen X', 'Zhang L', 'Wang T', 'Zhuang Y', 'Fan Y', 'Xu J', 'Chen Y', 'Wu L']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, P.R.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Stratification of mTOR activity was carried out in patients with primary CLL samples and an aggressive CLL-like mouse model. The potency of dual mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells was assessed in the presence/absence of B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation. Furthermore, we addressed the molecular and functional impact of dual mTOR inhibition in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. RESULTS: Differential regulation of basal mTORC1 activity was observed in poor prognostic CLL samples, with elevated p4EBP1(T37/46) and decreased p70S6 kinase activity, suggesting that dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors may exhibit improved response in poor prognostic CLL compared with rapalogs. AZD8055 treatment of primary CLL cells significantly reduced CLL survival in vitro compared with rapamycin, preferentially targeting poor prognostic subsets and overcoming BCR-mediated survival advantages. Furthermore, AZD8055, and clinical analog AZD2014, significantly reduced CLL tumor load in mice. AKT substrate FOXO1, while overexpressed in CLL cells of poor prognostic patients in LN biopsies, peripheral CLL cells, and mouse-derived CLL-like cells, appeared to be inactive. AZD8055 treatment partially reversed FOXO1 inactivation downstream of BCR crosslinking, significantly inhibiting FOXO1(T24) phosphorylation in an mTORC2-AKT-dependent manner, to promote FOXO1 nuclear localization, activity, and FOXO1-mediated gene regulation. FOXO1 activity was further significantly enhanced on combining AZD8055 with ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that dual mTOR inhibitors show promise as future CLL therapies, particularly in combination with ibrutinib.","['Cosimo, Emilio', 'Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Moles, Michael W', 'Holroyd, Ailsa K', 'Malik, Natasha', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Hay, Jodie', 'Dunn, Karen M', 'Macdonald, Alan M', 'Guichard, Sylvie M', ""O'Rourke, Declan"", 'Leach, Michael T', 'Sansom, Owen J', 'Cosulich, Sabina C', 'McCaig, Alison M', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Cosimo E', 'Tarafdar A', 'Moles MW', 'Holroyd AK', 'Malik N', 'Catherwood MA', 'Hay J', 'Dunn KM', 'Macdonald AM', 'Guichard SM', ""O'Rourke D"", 'Leach MT', 'Sansom OJ', 'Cosulich SC', 'McCaig AM', 'Michie AM']",,"['Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Forma Therapeutics, Watertown, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Histopathology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Bioscience, Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

A hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is the intranuclear accumulation of mutant, misfolded ataxin-7 (polyQ-ATXN7). Here, we show that endogenous ATXN7 is modified by SUMO proteins, thus also suggesting a physiological role for this modification under conditions of proteotoxic stress caused by the accumulation of polyQ-ATXN7. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, immunofluorescence microscopy and proximity ligation assays confirmed the colocalization and interaction of polyQ-ATXN7 with SUMO2 in cells. Moreover, upon inhibition of the proteasome, both endogenous SUMO2/3 and the RNF4 ubiquitin ligase surround large polyQ-ATXN7 intranuclear inclusions. Overexpression of RNF4 and/or SUMO2 significantly decreased levels of polyQ-ATXN7 and, upon proteasomal inhibition, led to a marked increase in the polyubiquitination of polyQ-ATXN7. This provides a mechanism for the clearance of polyQ-ATXN7 from affected cells that involves the recruitment of RNF4 by SUMO2/3-modified polyQ-ATXN7, thus leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In a SCA7 knock-in mouse model, we similarly observed colocalization of SUMO2/3 with polyQ-ATXN7 inclusions in the cerebellum and retina. Furthermore, we detected accumulation of SUMO2/3 high-molecular-mass species in the cerebellum of SCA7 knock-in mice, compared with their wild-type littermates, and changes in SUMO-related transcripts. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the accumulation of SUMO proteins and RNF4 in the cerebellum of SCA7 patients. Taken together, our results show that the SUMO pathway contributes to the clearance of aggregated ATXN7 and suggest that its deregulation might be associated with SCA7 disease progression.","['Marinello, Martina', 'Werner, Andreas', 'Giannone, Mariagiovanna', 'Tahiri, Khadija', 'Alves, Sandro', 'Tesson, Christelle', 'den Dunnen, Wilfred', 'Seeler, Jacob-S', 'Brice, Alexis', 'Sittler, Annie']","['Marinello M', 'Werner A', 'Giannone M', 'Tahiri K', 'Alves S', 'Tesson C', 'den Dunnen W', 'Seeler JS', 'Brice A', 'Sittler A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9059-3310', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9760-6935']","['Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE), Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, Neurogenetics Group, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Zentrum fur Molekulare Biologie der Universitat Heidelberg, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE), Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, Neurogenetics Group, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE), Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University, Neurogenetics Group, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Nuclear Organization and Oncogenesis Unit, INSERM U.993, Department of Cell Biology and Infection, Institut Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, Genetic Department, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC, Univ Paris 06 UMRS 1127, INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013 Paris, France annie.sittler@college-de-france.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (Ataxin-7)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Aggregates)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,"['Animals', 'Ataxin-7/*metabolism', 'Cerebellum/metabolism', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Aggregates/drug effects', '*Protein Folding/drug effects', '*Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias/*metabolism/pathology', '*Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",PMC6361149,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmm.036145 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.036145 [doi]']",epublish,Dis Model Mech. 2019 Jan 11;12(1). pii: dmm.036145. doi: 10.1242/dmm.036145.,['(c) 2019.

Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to derive a more precise estimation of the association between MTR A2756G polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to pediatric ALL. The PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wanfang Databases and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched to identify all the previous published studies exploring the relationship between MTR A2756G polymorphism and pediatric ALL risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the strength of association. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also systematically assessed. This meta-analysis finally included ten available studies with 3224 ALL cases and 4077 matched controls. The results showed that there was significant association between MTR A2756G polymorphism and risk of pediatric ALL in overall population (AG vs. AA: OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.02-1.26, P = 0.02; AG+GG vs. AA: OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.02-1.25, P = 0.01; G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 1.01-1.20, P = 0.03). In the stratification analyses by ethnicity, quality score and control source, significant association was found in Caucasians, population-based designed studies and studies assigned as high quality. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that MTR A2756G polymorphism may influence the development risk of pediatric ALL in Caucasians. Future large scale and well-designed studies are required to validate our findings.","['Ma, Li-Min', 'Yang, Hai-Ping', 'Yang, Xue-Wen', 'Ruan, Lin-Hai']","['Ma LM', 'Yang HP', 'Yang XW', 'Ruan LH']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4113-8965'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, Henan Province, China (yfyyanghaiping@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, Henan Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.13.

Although thoracic complications are frequent in CLL, only limited data exists regarding these complications. Pleural, parenchymal, and airway disease may occur owing to CLL itself, treatment-related adverse events, typical or opportunistic infections, or from preexisting comorbidities. The etiology of parenchymal infiltrates is often attributed to pneumonia and can be difficult to properly identify without a diagnostic procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients admitted from 2000 through 2016 with a diagnosis of CLL and abnormal radiography that underwent a bronchoscopy with biopsy, surgical lung biopsy, or transthoracic biopsies for nonresolving infiltrates after a course of antibiotics. We described the incidence of bronchopulmonary leukemic infiltrates (BPLI), describe other diagnosis achieved by the biopsy, and also describe the pathologic findings associated with BPLI in these patients. RESULTS: There were 111 procedures performed on 98 patients that yielded a diagnosis in 82 patients. In 16 patients, no histologic or pathologic diagnosis was identified after the biopsy. BPLI was diagnosed in 32 (39%) cases. In 27 (85%) of 32 cases, the biopsies returned with only BPLI owing to CLL (without inflammation), whereas 5 (15%) of 32 cases showed concomitant acute or chronic inflammation.

We hypothesised that dual B-cell receptor pathway blockade would be tolerable and efficacious. We investigated a next-generation phosphoinositide-3-kinase-delta inhibitor (PI3K-deltai), umbralisib, plus a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), ibrutinib, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma. METHODS: We did an investigator-initiated, multicentre, phase 1-1b study of patients from five sites in the USA (academic and community sites). Patients were 18 years and older with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or mantle cell lymphoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and were given umbralisib orally once daily (400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg) and ibrutinib orally once daily (420 mg for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or 560 mg for mantle cell lymphoma) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts for each histology escalated independently in a standard 3 x 3 design. The primary endpoints were intention-to-treat assessment of maximum-tolerated dose, safety, and dose-limiting toxicities. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02268851. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2014, and March 7, 2018, we enrolled 44 patients, of which 42 were given at least one dose of study drug (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, n=21; mantle cell lymphoma, n=21). Patients had a median age of 68 years (range 48-85) and had a median of two (IQR 1-3) previous therapies. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and the maximum-tolerated dose of umbralisib was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib when given in combination with ibrutinib was 800 mg once daily. The most frequent adverse events included diarrhoea (22 [52%] patients, 10% of whom had grade 3), infection (21 [50%], 17% grade 3-4), and transaminitis (ten [24%], 2% grade 3). Serious adverse events occurred in 12 (29%) patients and included lipase elevation, atrial fibrillation, hypophosphataemia, adrenal insufficiency, transaminitis, and infections. INTERPRETATION: Umbralisib plus ibrutinib is well tolerated and active in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma, with a recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib 800 mg once daily. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first clinical data on a BTKi and PI3K-deltai doublet in B-cell malignancies, and the results suggest that this approach is feasible and worthy of further study.

Activation of cytokine independent signalling through the JAK/STAT cascade is a feature of these disorders. A point mutation in exon 14 of the JAK2 gene resulting in the formation of the JAK2 V617F transcript occurs in 95% of PV patients and around 50% of ET and PMF patients driving constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in CALR or MPL are present as driving mutations in the majority of remaining ET and PMF patients. Ruxolitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits JAK1 and JAK2. It is approved for use in intermediate and high risk PMF, and in PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxycarbamide. In randomised controlled trials it has demonstrated efficacy in spleen volume reduction and symptom burden reduction with a moderate improvement in overall survival in PMF. In PV, there is demonstrated benefit in haematocrit control and spleen volume. Despite these benefits, there is limited impact to induce complete haematological remission with normalisation of blood counts, reduce the mutant allele burden or reverse bone marrow fibrosis. Clonal evolution has been observed on ruxolitinib therapy and transformation to acute leukaemia can still occur. This review will concentrate on understanding the clinical and molecular effects of ruxolitinib in MPN. We will focus on understanding the limitations of JAK inhibition and the challenges to improving therapeutic efficacy in these disorders. We will explore the demonstrated benefits and disadvantages of ruxolitinib in the clinic, the role of genomic and clonal variability in pathogenesis and response to JAK inhibition, epigenetic changes which impact on response to therapy, the role of DNA damage and the role of inflammation in these disorders. Finally, we will summarise the future prospects for improving therapy in MPN in the JAK inhibition era.","['Greenfield, Graeme', 'McPherson, Suzanne', 'Mills, Ken', 'McMullin, Mary Frances']","['Greenfield G', 'McPherson S', 'Mills K', 'McMullin MF']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2333-1374'],"[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK. g.greenfield@qub.ac.uk."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", ""Centre for Medical Education, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clonal Evolution', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Nitriles', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6296062,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-018-1729-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-018-1729-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2018 Dec 17;16(1):360. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1729-7.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetics', '*Essential thrombocythemia', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*Polycythaemia vera', '*Primary myelofibrosis', '*Ruxolitinib']",,,20181217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that feature covalently closed continuous loops, suggesting their potential as micro RNA (miRNA) ""sponges"" that can participate in biological processes and pathogenesis. However, investigations on circRNAs in EMI were conducted rarely. In this study, the overall alterations of circRNAs and their regulatory network between EMI and non-EMI AML were delineated. METHODS: CircRNA and whole genome microarrays derived from EMI and non-EMI AML bone marrow mononuclear cells were carried out. Functional analysis was performed via Gene Ontology and KEGG test methods. The speculated functional roles of circRNAs were based on mRNAs and predicted miRNAs that played intermediate roles. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was conducted to further characterize the circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network and identify the functions of distinct circRNAs. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were acquired to evaluate the poor prognosis of distinct target genes of circRNAs. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to identify the expression of has_circRNA_0004520. Connectivity map (CMap) analysis was further performed to predict potential therapeutic agents for EMI. RESULTS: 253 circRNAs and 663 genes were upregulated and 259 circRNAs and 838 genes were downregulated in EMI compared to non-EMI AML samples. GO pathways were enriched in progress including cell adhesion (GO:0030155; GO:0007155), migration (GO:0016477; GO:0030334), signal transduction (GO:0009966; GO:0007165) and cell-cell communication. Overlapping circRNAs envolved in pathways related to regulate cell-cell crosstalk, 17 circRNAs were chosen based on their putative roles. 7 target genes of 17 circRNAs (LRRK1, PLXNB2, OLFML2A, LYPD5, APOL3, ZNF511, and ASB2) indicated a poor prognosis, while overexpression of PAPLN and NRXN3 indicated a better one based on data from TCGA. LY-294002, trichostatin A and SB-202190 were identified as therapeutic candidates for EMI by the CMap analysis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study reveals the overall alterations of circRNA and mRNA involved in EMI and suggests potential circRNAs may act as biomarkers and targets for early diagnosis and treatment of EMI.","['Lv, Chengfang', 'Sun, Lili', 'Guo, Zhibo', 'Li, Huibo', 'Kong, Desheng', 'Xu, Bingqi', 'Lin, Leilei', 'Liu, Tianjiao', 'Guo, Dan', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Li, Yinghua']","['Lv C', 'Sun L', 'Guo Z', 'Li H', 'Kong D', 'Xu B', 'Lin L', 'Liu T', 'Guo D', 'Zhou J', 'Li Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8060-8221'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China. zhoujin_hmu@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, China. yinghualihmu@126.com.']",['eng'],"['LCO7C22/Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Heilongjiang', 'Province/International', '1153h12/Overseas Scholars Education Department of Heilongjiang', 'Province/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/*genetics', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",PMC6297994,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-018-1726-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-018-1726-x [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2018 Dec 17;16(1):361. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1726-x.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CMap', '*Cell-cell crosstalk', '*Circular RNAs/circRNAs', '*Extramedullary infiltration', '*Regulatory network']",,,20181217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this non-interventional study, patients were observed for up to 3 years from initiation of deferasirox treatment both prospectively and retrospectively for up to 1 year prior to enrollment. The primary end points were the proportion of patients with >/=1 notable increase in serum creatinine (SCr), and >/=1 notable increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). RESULTS: Overall, 120 patients were enrolled and 51 completed the study, with a limited 3-year dropout rate of 12.5% due to adverse events (AEs). Increase in SCr > 33% above baseline and the age-adjusted ULN (upper limit of normal) was observed in 14 patients (95%CI, 7.1-19.2). The ALT levels >5 x ULN was observed in 1 patient. Most frequent AEs reported during treatment with deferasirox include gastrointestinal disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term treatment with deferasirox was manageable in most transfusion-dependent patients with no unexpected safety findings. Regular monitoring and an adjusted deferasirox dosing strategy per local labels allowed continued iron chelation treatment and control of transfusional iron in the majority of patients on study.","['El-Beshlawy, Amal', 'Inusa, Baba', 'Beneitez Pastor, David', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Soledada Duran Nieto, Maria', 'Bruederle, Andreas', 'Azmon, Amin', 'Gilotti, Geralyn', 'Elalfy, Mohsen']","['El-Beshlawy A', 'Inusa B', 'Beneitez Pastor D', 'Xicoy B', 'Soledada Duran Nieto M', 'Bruederle A', 'Azmon A', 'Gilotti G', 'Elalfy M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6541-6600'],"['a Cairo University , Cairo , Egypt.', ""b Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Trust , London , UK."", ""c Hematology Department , Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron , Barcelona , Spain."", 'd ICO-Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute , Barcelona , Spain.', 'e Departamento de Hematologica , Hospital Materno Infantil de Jaen , Jaen , Spain.', 'f Novartis Pharma AG , Basel , Switzerland.', 'f Novartis Pharma AG , Basel , Switzerland.', 'g Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.', 'h Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Deferasirox/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemosiderosis/blood/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/blood/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transfusion Reaction/blood/*drug therapy']",,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2018.1558758 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):238-246. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2018.1558758.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Deferasirox', 'iron chelation therapy', 'iron overload', 'safety']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The supportive tumor cell-microenvironment interactions and the resulting cellular processes require adaptations and modulations of the cytoskeleton. The Rac subfamily of the Rho family GTPases includes key regulators of the cytoskeleton, with essential functions in both normal and transformed leukocytes. Rac proteins function downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, chemokine receptors, and integrins, orchestrating a multitude of signals arising from the microenvironment. As such, it is not surprising that deregulation of Rac expression and activation plays a role in the development and progression of hematological malignancies. In this review, we will give an overview of the specific contribution of the deregulation of Rac GTPases in hematologic malignancies.","['Durand-Onayli, Valerie', 'Haslauer, Theresa', 'Harzschel, Andrea', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole']","['Durand-Onayli V', 'Haslauer T', 'Harzschel A', 'Hartmann TN']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0377-7179'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. v.durand-onayli@salk.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. th.haslauer@salk.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. a.haerzschel@salk.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Salzburg Cancer Research Institute-Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. tanja.hartmann@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. tanja.hartmann@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['W1213/Austrian Science Fund', 'PMU FFF E-17-25-130-HAH/Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC6321480,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19124041 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19124041 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Dec 14;19(12). pii: ijms19124041. doi: 10.3390/ijms19124041.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Rac GTPases', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'microenvironment', 'migration', 'proliferation', 'survival']",,,20181214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major route of virus transmission is believed to be iatrogenic through the transfer of blood containing infected lymphocytes. In addition, BLV proviral DNA has been identified in nasal secretions, saliva, milk, colostrum, semen and smegma; however, natural transmission of BLV through these secretions has not been clearly demonstrated. The use of bulls for natural breeding has been identified as a risk factor in BLV infected dairy herds. However, the risk of BLV-infected bulls transmitting the virus is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for BLV transmission during natural breeding between a BLV-infected bull and uninfected heifers. Forty healthy, BLV seronegative, and proviral-negative beef heifers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control heifers (n=20) exposed to a BLV seronegative and proviral negative bull and challenged heifers (n=20) exposed to a BLV seropositive and proviral-positive bull. Each group was housed with the bull for a period of 38 days in a 5-acre pasture to replicate the housing of commercial beef cattle during the breeding season. Blood samples were collected from heifers at -60, -30 and 0 days prior to breeding and day 30, 60 and 90 after the breeding period ended. Blood samples were tested for BLV antibodies by ELISA and BLV proviral DNA by CoCoMo-qPCR. New infection was not detected by ELISA or CoCoMo-qPCR in any of the challenge or control heifers at any time point during the study. Based on these results, BLV infected bulls that are healthy and aleukemic may not be a significant risk of BLV transmission during a defined breeding season.","['Benitez, Oscar J', 'Roberts, Jennifer N', 'Norby, Bo', 'Bartlett, Paul C', 'Maeroff, Jacqueline E', 'Grooms, Daniel L']","['Benitez OJ', 'Roberts JN', 'Norby B', 'Bartlett PC', 'Maeroff JE', 'Grooms DL']",,"['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, 736 Wilson Rd, East Lansing, MI, 48895, USA.

In the present study, we examined the effects of DHA on the proliferation and ferroptosis of AML cells as well as to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that DHA strongly inhibited the viability of AML cell lines and arrest cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Further studies found that DHA effectively induced AML cells ferroptosis, which was iron-dependent and accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, DHA induced autophagy by regulating the activity of AMPK/mTOR/p70S6k signaling pathway, which accelerated the degradation of ferritin, increased the labile iron pool, promoted the accumulation of cellular ROS and eventually led to ferroptotic cell death. Over expression of ISCU (Iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme, a mitochondrial protein) significantly attenuated DHA induced ferroptosis by regulating iron metabolism, rescuing the mitochondrial function and increasing the level of GSH. Meanwhile, FTH reconstituted AML cells also exhibited the reduced lipid peroxides content and restored the DHA-induced ferroptosis. In summary, these results provide experimental evidences on the detailed mechanism of DHA-induced ferroptosis and reveal that DHA might represent a promising therapeutic agent to preferentially target AML cells.","['Du, Jing', 'Wang, Tongtong', 'Li, Yanchun', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Wang, Xin', 'Yu, Xingxing', 'Ren, Xueying', 'An, Yihan', 'Wu, Yi', 'Sun, Weidong', 'Fan, Weimin', 'Zhu, Qiaojuan', 'Wang, Ying', 'Tong, Xiangmin']","['Du J', 'Wang T', 'Li Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang X', 'Yu X', 'Ren X', 'An Y', 'Wu Y', 'Sun W', 'Fan W', 'Zhu Q', 'Wang Y', 'Tong X']",,"[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Wangjiangshan Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China; The Second Clinical Medical School of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China; The Second Clinical Medical School of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310005, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China; Department of Haematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China; The Second Clinical Medical School of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China; Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China.

As the T-cell-mediated immunity involves antigen presentation on HLA class I molecules, we hypothesized that individuals with suitable HLA type could be less prone to develop NPMc+ AML. We compared HLA class I distribution in NPMc+ AML patient cohort (398 patients from 5 centers) with the HLA allele frequencies of the healthy population and found HLA-A*02, B*07, B*40 and C*07 underrepresented in the NPMc+ AML group. Presence of B*07 or C*07:01 antigen was associated with better survival in patients without concomitant FLT3 internal tandem duplication. Candidate NPM-derived immunopeptides were found for B*40 and B*07 using prediction software tools. Our findings suggest that a T-cell-mediated immune response could actually explain better prognosis of NPMc+ patients and provide a rationale for attempts to explore the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms in this AML subgroup.","['Kuzelova, Katerina', 'Brodska, Barbora', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Walz, Juliane Stickel', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Fuchs, Ota', 'Vrana, Milena', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Mayer, Jiri']","['Kuzelova K', 'Brodska B', 'Schetelig J', 'Rollig C', 'Racil Z', 'Walz JS', 'Helbig G', 'Fuchs O', 'Vrana M', 'Pecherkova P', 'Salek C', 'Mayer J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9628-6255'],"['Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Genomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'HLA department, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Clinical Department, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prevalence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC6296532,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0204290 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-25565 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Dec 17;13(12):e0204290. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204290. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181217,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we discuss the potential involvement of MMPs and their inhibitors in the pathogenesis and progression of leukemia by examining their role in the prognosis of leukemia. Inducing leukemic cell growth, migration, invasiveness, and angiogenesis are the main roles of MMPs in leukemia progression mediated by their degradative activity. Given the important role of MMPs in leukemia progression, further clinical trials are needed to confirm the link between MMPs' expressions and leukemia prognosis. It is hoped to use MMPs as therapeutic targets to improve patients' health by recognizing the prognostic value of MMPs in leukemia and their effect on the progression of these malignancies and their response to treatment.","['Amin Asnafi, Ali', 'Bagheri, Marziye', 'Zibara, Kazem', 'Maleki Behzad, Masumeh', 'Shahrabi, Saeid']","['Amin Asnafi A', 'Bagheri M', 'Zibara K', 'Maleki Behzad M', 'Shahrabi S']",,"['Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz.', 'ER045, PRASE, Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)']",IM,"['Gelatinases/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/enzymology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001386 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Mar;41(2):87-95. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic hypermutation of the BCR heavy chains (IGVH) defines a subgroup of patients with a better prognosis. In up to 10% of CLL cases, a transformation to an aggressive B cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome) with a dismal prognosis can be observed over time. NFAT proteins are transcription factors originally identified in T cells, which also play an important role in B cells. The TCL1 transgenic mouse is a well-accepted model of CLL. Upon B cell-specific deletion of NFAT2, TCL1 transgenic mice develop a disease resembling human Richter's syndrome. Whereas TCL1 B cells exhibit tonic anergic BCR signaling characteristic of human CLL, loss of NFAT2 expression leads to readily activated BCRs indicating different BCR usage with altered downstream signaling. Here, we analyzed BCR usage in wild-type and TCL1 transgenic mice with and without NFAT2 deletion employing conventional molecular biology techniques and next-generation sequencing (NGS). We demonstrate that the loss of NFAT2 in CLL precipitates the selection of unmutated BCRs and the preferential usage of certain VDJ recombinations, which subsequently results in the accelerated development of oligoclonal disease.","['Muller, David J', 'Wirths, Stefan', 'Fuchs, Alexander R', 'Marklin, Melanie', 'Heitmann, Jonas S', 'Sturm, Marc', 'Haap, Michael', 'Kirschniak, Andreas', 'Sasaki, Yoshiteru', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Kopp, Hans-Georg', 'Muller, Martin R']","['Muller DJ', 'Wirths S', 'Fuchs AR', 'Marklin M', 'Heitmann JS', 'Sturm M', 'Haap M', 'Kirschniak A', 'Sasaki Y', 'Kanz L', 'Kopp HG', 'Muller MR']",,"['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology, Clinical Pathology and Metabolism, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'V(D)J Recombination/genetics']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/10/19 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.2AB0218-076RR [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 Mar;105(3):531-538. doi: 10.1002/JLB.2AB0218-076RR.

Despite rapid hydration, leucovorin rescue, and routine therapeutic drug monitoring, severe toxicity is not uncommon. This study aimed at developing population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models of high-dose methotrexate for ALL and osteosarcoma and demonstrating the possibility and convenience of popPK model-based individual dose optimization using R and shiny, which is more accessible, efficient, and clinician-friendly than NONMEM. The final data set consists of 36 ALL (354 observations) and 16 osteosarcoma (585 observations) patients. Covariate model building and parameter estimations were done using NONMEM and Perl-speaks-NONMEM. Diagnostic Plots and bootstrapping validated the models' performance and stability. The dose optimizer developed based on the validated models can obtain identical individual parameter estimates as NONMEM. Compared to calling a NONMEM execution and reading its output, estimating individual parameters within R reduces the execution time from 8.7-12.8 seconds to 0.4-1.0 second. For each subject, the dose optimizer can recommend (1) an individualized optimal dose and (2) an individualized range of doses. For osteosarcoma, recommended optimal doses by the optimizer resemble the final doses at which the subjects were eventually stabilized. The dose optimizers developed demonstrated the potential to inform dose adjustments using a model-based, convenient, and efficient tool for high-dose methotrexate. Although the dose optimizer is not meant to replace clinical judgment, it provides the clinician with the individual pharmacokinetics perspective by recommending the (range of) optimal dose.","['Hui, Ka Ho', 'Chu, Ho Man', 'Fong, Pui Shan', 'Cheng, Wai Tsoi Frankie', 'Lam, Tai Ning']","['Hui KH', 'Chu HM', 'Fong PS', 'Cheng WTF', 'Lam TN']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0950-8524', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7259-4050']","['School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Division of Haematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Asians', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1349 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Apr;59(4):566-577. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1349.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured the expression level of miR-212-5p in 35 AML patients and 20 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as control cases. Besides, the miR-212-5p expression at cellular level was checked as well. In order to screen the functional targets of miR-212-5p, online prediction software was used and gene frizzled class receptor 5 (FZD5) attracted our attention. The effects of miR-212-5p on biological functions of AML cell line (Kasumi-1) were analyzed by subsequent experiments. The mRNA and protein expressions of FZD5 were detected by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) analysis, respectively. Cell proliferation was tested by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were measured by fl ow cytometry. Finally, protein expression of beta-catenin was analyzed by WB assay. RESULTS: In AML cases and cells, miR-212-5p was found to be lowly expressed. The potential target of miR-212-5p was predicated in three public databases. Through a series of experiments including qRT-PCR, WB and luciferase assay, we identified FZD5 as a functional target of miR-212-5p. In further cellular functional experiments on Kasumi-1, we found overexpression of miR-212-5p in Kasumi-1 cells greatly inhibited the cell viability and proliferation. The ratio of cells in G0/G1 phase and the proportion of apoptotic cells increased after miR-212-5p overexpression. Furthermore, Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway was the most apparent pathway that was regulated by miR-212-5p according to WB results. However, the effects of miR-212-5p were suppressed after restoring the expression of FZD5. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of miR-212-5p was significantly lower in AML patients and cell lines, indicating that miR-212-5p served as a tumor-suppressor gene in AML. According to our in vitro experiments, miR-212-5p/FZD5 was likely to become a new therapeutic target for AML.","['Lin, J-F', 'Zeng, H', 'Zhao, J-Q']","['Lin JF', 'Zeng H', 'Zhao JQ']",,"['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China. zhaojianqiang@xiyi.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (FZD5 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (MIRN212 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Frizzled Receptors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/11/21 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201812_16540 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Dec;22(23):8415-8422. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201812_16540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although recent studies have reported that exposure to Cu-NPs leads to organ accumulation and obvious toxicity, it remains unclear whether Cu-NPs can be translocated to and cause damage in the uterus. In this study, we investigated the potential for uterine injury and gene expression patterns in female rats exposed to 3.12, 6.25, or 12.5 mg/kg/d Cu-NPs via intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days. The results indicated that exposure to Cu-NPs led to significant decreases in the relative uterine weight coefficients and increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, mitochondrial swelling and vacuolization, shortened and reduced endometrial epithelial cell microvilli, and apoptosis. Furthermore, exposure to Cu-NPs increased malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Signal transduction mechanism studies indicated that exposure to Cu-NPs activated caspases 3, 8, and 9 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (tBid), reduced B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, and increased the expression of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and cytochrome c. A microarray analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of 963 genes; of these, 622 were upregulated and 341 were downregulated. The results of further evaluations of some altered genes, including matrix metallopeptidase 12 (Mmp12), using quantitative RT-PCR agreed with the microarray findings. These results provide strong evidence that Cu-NPs can trigger both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways to mediate uterine injury, resulting in oxidative stress-related changes in gene expression.","['Hu, Shifu', 'Yang, Jing', 'Rao, Meng', 'Wang, Yingying', 'Zhou, Fang', 'Cheng, Guiping', 'Xia, Wei', 'Zhu, Changhong']","['Hu S', 'Yang J', 'Rao M', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou F', 'Cheng G', 'Xia W', 'Zhu C']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6918-095X'],"['Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Reproduction and Genetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['no. 81671507/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'HUST; grant no. 2015ZDTD050/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central', 'Universities', 'no. 2016YFC1000903/National Key Research and Development Program']",['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,"['4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Copper/*toxicity', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Uterus/*drug effects/*injuries/metabolism']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.22680 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2019 Mar;34(3):252-261. doi: 10.1002/tox.22680.

We previously identified v-Erb A related-2 (EAR-2, NR2F6) as a gene involved in control of growth ability. Methods: Bone marrow obtained from C57BL/6 mice was transfected with a retrovirus containing EAR-2-IRES-GFP. Ex vivo transduced cells were flow sorted. In some experiments cells were cultured in vitro, in other experiments cells were injected into lethally irradiated recipients, along with non-transduced bone marrow cells. Short-hairpin RNA silencing EAR-2 was also introduced into bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo. Results: Here, we show that EAR-2 inhibits maturation of normal BM in vitro and in vivo and that EAR-2 transplant chimeras demonstrate key features of MDS. Competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated murine hosts with EAR-2-transduced BM cells resulted in increased engraftment and increased colony formation in serial replating experiments. Recipients of EAR-2-transduced grafts had hypercellular BM, erythroid dysplasia, abnormal localization of immature precursors and increased blasts; secondary transplantation resulted in acute leukemia. Animals were cytopenic, having reduced numbers of erythrocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Suspension culture confirmed that EAR-2 inhibits granulocytic and monocytic differentiation, while knockdown induced granulocytic differentiation. We observed a reduction in the number of BFU-E and CFU-GM colonies and the size of erythroid and myeloid colonies. Serial replating of transduced hematopoietic colonies revealed extended replating potential in EAR-2-overexpressing BM, while knockdown reduced re-plating ability. EAR-2 functions by recruitment of histone deacetylases, and inhibition of differentiation in 32D cells is dependent on the DNA binding domain. Conclusions: This data suggest that NR2F6 inhibits maturation of normal BM in vitro and in vivo and that the NR2F6 transplant chimera system demonstrates key features of MDS, and could provide a mouse model for MDS.","['Ichim, Christine V', 'Dervovic, Dzana D', 'Chan, Lap Shu Alan', 'Robertson, Claire J', 'Chesney, Alden', 'Reis, Marciano D', 'Wells, Richard A']","['Ichim CV', 'Dervovic DD', 'Chan LSA', 'Robertson CJ', 'Chesney A', 'Reis MD', 'Wells RA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8945-4006'],"['Nuclear Exploration Inc., Palo Alto, California 94301 USA.', '3Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '4Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '4Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '5Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '3Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '4Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '1Materials Engineering Division, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA USA.0000 0001 2160 9702grid.250008.f', '6VCU Medical Centre, Department of Pathology, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.0000 0004 0458 8737grid.224260.0', '9Department of Laboratory Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4 Canada.0000 0004 0474 0428grid.231844.8', '3Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '4Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '6VCU Medical Centre, Department of Pathology, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.0000 0004 0458 8737grid.224260.0', '7Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4 Canada.0000 0001 2157 2938grid.17063.33', '8Department of Medical Oncology, Myelodysplastic Syndromes Program, Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5 Canada.0000 0000 9743 1587grid.413104.3']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC6286615,,2018/12/18 06:00,2018/12/18 06:01,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-018-0149-4 [doi]', '149 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2018 Dec 7;6:36. doi: 10.1186/s40364-018-0149-4. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplant', 'Clonogenicity', 'Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Mouse model', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Nuclear receptor', 'Progenitor cell', 'Stem cell']",,,20181207,,"['Not applicableNot applicableCVI is a former employee of Regen BioPharma Inc.

Glasdegib 100 mg (oral, QD) was administered continuously in 28-day cycles; LDAC 20 mg (subcutaneous, BID) was administered for 10 per 28 days. Patients (stratified by cytogenetic risk) were randomized (2:1) to receive glasdegib/LDAC or LDAC. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Eighty-eight and 44 patients were randomized to glasdegib/LDAC and LDAC, respectively. Median (80% confidence interval [CI]) overall survival was 8.8 (6.9-9.9) months with glasdegib/LDAC and 4.9 (3.5-6.0) months with LDAC (hazard ratio, 0.51; 80% CI, 0.39-0.67, P = 0.0004). Fifteen (17.0%) and 1 (2.3%) patients in the glasdegib/LDAC and LDAC arms, respectively, achieved complete remission (P < 0.05). Nonhematologic grade 3/4 all-causality adverse events included pneumonia (16.7%) and fatigue (14.3%) with glasdegib/LDAC and pneumonia (14.6%) with LDAC. Clinical efficacy was evident across patients with diverse mutational profiles.

Herein, we report that an HMGCLL1 genetic variant located in 6p12.1 can be used as a predictive genetic biomarker for intrinsic sensitivity to imatinib (IM) therapy. We measured DMR rate according to HMGCLL1 variant in a discovery set of CML patients (n = 201) and successfully replicated it in a validation set (n = 270). We also investigated the functional relevance of HMGCLL1 blockade with respect to response to TKI therapy and showed that small interfering RNA mediated blockade of HMGCLL1 isoform 3 results in significant decrease in viability of BCR-ABL1-positive cells including K562, CML-T1 or BaF3 cell lines with or without ABL1 kinase domain mutations such as T315I mutation. Decreased cell viability was also demonstrated in murine CML stem cells and human hematopoietic progenitor cells. RNA sequencing showed that blockade of HMGCLL1 was associated with G0/G1 arrest and the cell cycle. In summary, the HMGCLL1 gene polymorphism is a novel genetic biomarker for intrinsic sensitivity to IM therapy in CML patients that predicts DMR in this setting.","['Park, Jong-Ho', 'Woo, Young Min', 'Youm, Emilia Moonkyung', 'Hamad, Nada', 'Won, Hong-Hee', 'Naka, Kazuhito', 'Park, Eun-Ju', 'Park, June-Hee', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Ahn, Jae Sook', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Park, Silvia', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Kim, Jong-Won', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Park JH', 'Woo YM', 'Youm EM', 'Hamad N', 'Won HH', 'Naka K', 'Park EJ', 'Park JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Ahn JS', 'Sohn SK', 'Moon JH', 'Jung CW', 'Park S', 'Lipton JH', 'Kimura S', 'Kim JW', 'Kim DDH']",,"['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Future Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Research Institute for Future Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea. kimjw@skku.edu.', 'Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. kimjw@skku.edu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. kimjw@skku.edu.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 4.1.3.- (Oxo-Acid-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.3.4 (HMGCLL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival', 'Cohort Studies', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Oxo-Acid-Lyases/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",PMC6756062,,2018/12/18 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0321-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0321-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1439-1450. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0321-8.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) arises from mature B cells, expressing functional BCRs, mainly of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgD isotypes. Importantly, 30% of CLL patients express quasi-identical BCRs, the so-called ""stereotyped"" receptors, indicating the existence of common antigenic determinants, which may drive disease initiation and favor its progression. Although the antigenic specificity of IgM and IgD receptors is identical, there are distinct isotype-specific responses after IgM and IgD triggering. Here, we discuss the most important steps of normal B cell development, and highlight the importance of BCR signaling for CLL pathogenesis, with a focus on differences between IgM and IgD isotype signaling. We also highlight the main characteristics of CLL patient subsets, based on BCR stereotypy, and describe subset-specific BCR function and antigen-binding characteristics. Finally, we outline the key biologic and clinical responses to kinase inhibitor therapy, targeting the BCR-associated Bruton's tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, and spleen tyrosine kinase in patients with CLL.","['Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Gounari, Maria', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Ten Hacken E', 'Gounari M', 'Ghia P', 'Burger JA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1573-8799', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3750-7342']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '9965/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Italian Association for', 'Cancer Research)/International', 'CA016672/UT | University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD', 'Anderson)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7182338,['NIHMS1575737'],2018/12/18 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0303-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0303-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):287-298. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0303-x.

However, it has not been fully analyzed in other hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, 304 adult patients with de novo MDS had the FLT3 sequence tested on their bone marrow sample. With 279 patients who had follow-up information, we also analyzed the impact of clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as FLT3 mutation status and treatment on prognosis. RESULTS: We found that the transformation rate was 3 (42.9%) of 7 patients in the FLT3-ITD-positive group, compared with 31 (10.4%) of 297 among FLT3-ITD-negative patients (P = .033). The median progression-free survival of the FLT3-ITD mutated and wild-type groups were 43 days and 363.5 days, respectively (P < .0001). The median overall survival (OS) of the 2 groups were 218 days and 410.5 days, respectively (P < .0001). We also found that 5 factors had independent prognostic impact on OS: white blood cell counts, bone marrow blast percentage, cytogenetics, transplantation status, and FLT3-ITD mutation. Furthermore, compared with the transformation group, the non-progression group was younger (P = .034), with a lower platelet count (P = .022), a lower bone marrow blast percentage (P = .001), a lower FLT3-ITD incidence (P = .007), and a longer OS (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: When observed at the MDS stage, patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutations had higher AML transformation rate, quicker disease progression, and shorter survival than wild-type patients. Nevertheless, once the disease progressed to leukemia, the impact of FLT3-ITD mutations on prognosis was slight. In addition, the prognosis of secondary AML was very poor whether there was an FLT3-ITD mutation or not.","['Xu, Fei', 'Han, Rong', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Li, Zheng', 'Wang, Jun', 'Chu, Xiao-Ling', 'Yu, Jing-Qiu', 'Wang, Chao', 'Tao, Tao', 'Shen, Hong-Jie', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Liu, Song-Bai', 'Qiu, Qiao-Cheng', 'Xue, Sheng-Li']","['Xu F', 'Han R', 'Zhang J', 'Li Z', 'Wang J', 'Chu XL', 'Yu JQ', 'Wang C', 'Tao T', 'Shen HJ', 'Chen SN', 'Wu DP', 'Liu SB', 'Qiu QC', 'Xue SL']",,"['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanyang Medical College, Nanyang, China.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, the Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou, Suzhou, China."", 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Suzhou Key Laboratory for Medical Biotechnology, Suzhou Vocational Health College, Suzhou, China.

The World Health Organization classification coined this group designation in 2008 to include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomoncoytic leukemia, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis as a provisional entity, and MDS/MPN unclassified. In this review, we highlight the challenges in diagnosing this group of the diseases, summarize the updates in classification, and discuss recent evolving understanding of the genetic landscape. We review risk-stratification models and overview the current management largely adapted from current MDS or MPN therapies. We define clinical benefit of therapy based on new proposed response criteria developed specifically for these groups of neoplasms. Finally, we introduce future opportunities including the planned international ABN MARRO (A Novel therapy combinations in untreated MDS/MPN And Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) clinical study led by the MDS/MPN International Working Group.","['Smith, Brianna N', 'Savona, Michael', 'Komrokji, Rami S']","['Smith BN', 'Savona M', 'Komrokji RS']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'H.

Genetic alterations, fusions and mutations, may result in misexpression of key genes in AML. We aimed to investigate the expression patterns of 4 novel genes; FIS1, SPI1, PDCD7 and Ang2 to determine their potential prognostic role in AML patients. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed for of FIS1, SPI1, PDCD7 and Ang2 expression levels by real-time quantitative PCR as well as of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutations in 100 newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal (CN-AML) patients, and 100 non-malignant controls. RESULTS: FIS1, SPI1, PDCD7 and Ang2 were significantly overexpressed in CN-AML patients (p<0.001). Their high expression levels were significantly associated with lower complete remission (CR) rate, shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). On multivariate analysis, high FIS1 expression showed a significant impact on CR response after induction therapy (OR=88.777, 95% C.I: 2.85-2765.78, p=0.011) while high PDCD7 appeared to be an independent risk factor for RFS (HR=5.107, 95% C.I: 1.731-15.066, p=0.003) and OS (HR=7.353, 95% C.I: 1.859-29.079, p=0.004) in CN-AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: FIS1 and PDCD7 expression are considered independent risk factors and should be integrated into the current AML stratification system.","['Abo Elwafa, Reham', 'Gamaleldin, Marwa', 'Ghallab, Omar']","['Abo Elwafa R', 'Gamaleldin M', 'Ghallab O']",,"['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.

However, the pattern of SOX7 methylation and its clinical significance are less studied in hematological malignancies. Herein, we evaluated the methylation pattern of SOX7 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and determined its clinical implication in patients with MDS. METHODS: SOX7 methylation was determined by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) in 99 MDS patients. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was applied to confirm the results of RQ-MSP. RESULTS: SOX7 methylation was detected in 55.6% of 99 patients but not in healthy donors. No correlation was found between SOX7 methylation and clinical parameters including patient age, gender, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, patients with SOX7 methylation harbored more U2AF1 mutation than patients without SOX7 methylation (P = 0.015). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that the patients with SOX7 methylation presented reduced overall survival (OS) (P = 0.034). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that SOX7 methylation was associated with poor OS in male patients (P = 0.034) and in patients older than 60 years (P = 0.019). According to the multivariate analysis, SOX7 methylation remained as an independent prognosis factor in MDS patients both as dichotomous (HR = 2.14, P = 0.041) and as continuous (HR = 1.55, P = 0.042) variable. Importantly, SOX7 methylation was significantly increased during progression from MDS to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that SOX7 methylation conferred adverse prognosis in MDS patients and was associated with leukemia progression.","['Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Tang, Chun-Yan', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Leng, Jia-Yan', 'Qiu, Zhi-Yuan', 'Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang']","['Xu ZJ', 'Tang CY', 'Zhou JD', 'Ma JC', 'Wen XM', 'Deng ZQ', 'Leng JY', 'Qiu ZY', 'Qian J', 'Lin J']",,"[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212002, Jiangsu, PR China; Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang 212002, Jiangsu, P.R.

Approximately 80% of patients have a cytogenetic aberration. Interphase FISH panels have been the gold standard for cytogenetic evaluation, but conventional cytogenetics allows detection of additional abnormalities, including translocations, complex karyotypes and multiple clones. Whole genome copy number assessment, currently performed by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), is particularly relevant in CLL for the following reasons: (1) copy number alterations (CNAs) represent key events with biologic and prognostic significance; (2) DNA from fresh samples is generally available; and (3) the tumor burden tends to be relatively high in peripheral blood. CMA also identifies novel copy number variants and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH), and can refine deletion breakpoints. The Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC) Working Group for CLL has performed an extensive literature review to describe the evidence-based clinical utility of CMA in CLL. We provide suggestions for the integration of CMA into clinical use and list recurrent copy number alterations, regions of CN-LOH and mutated genes to aid in interpretation.","['Chun, Kathy', 'Wenger, Gail D', 'Chaubey, Alka', 'Dash, D P', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Kantarci, Sibel', 'Kolhe, Ravindra', 'Van Dyke, Daniel L', 'Wang, Lu', 'Wolff, Daynna J', 'Miron, Patricia M']","['Chun K', 'Wenger GD', 'Chaubey A', 'Dash DP', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Kantarci S', 'Kolhe R', 'Van Dyke DL', 'Wang L', 'Wolff DJ', 'Miron PM']",,"['Genetics Program, North York General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Therefore, this study measured feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) antibodies in retrovirus-infected cats within a period of 28 days after FPV vaccination, and compared the immune response to that of non-infected cats. METHODS: Eight asymptomatic retrovirus-infected cats (four FeLV, four FIV), and non-infected age-matched control cats (n = 67) were vaccinated with a commercial FPV modified live virus (MLV). Pre- and post-vaccination antibody titres were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) on days 0, 7 and 28. An HI titre 1:40 was defined as protective. An adequate response to vaccination was defined as a four-fold titre increase or higher. Comparison of the immune response of retrovirus-infected and non-infected cats was performed. RESULTS: Pre-vaccination FPV antibody titres 1:40 were present in 100% (n = 8/8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 62.8-100) of retrovirus-infected and in 77.6% (n = 52/67; 95% CI 66.2-86.0) of non-infected cats. An adequate response to vaccination (titre increase four-fold) was seen in 1/8 retrovirus-infected cats (12.5%; 95% CI 0.1-49.2) compared with 22/67 non-infected cats (32.8%; 95% CI 22.8-44.8). In cats with high pre-vaccination titres (1:160), a four-fold titre increase or higher was observed in 1/8 retrovirus infected cats (12.5%; 95% CI 0.1-49.2) compared with 4/42 non-infected cats (9.5%; 95% CI 3.2-22.6). None of the eight retrovirus-infected cats developed illness or vaccination side effects after vaccination with MLV against FPV within the 28 days. There were no significant differences between groups: for pre-vaccination titres; for at least four-fold titre increases following vaccination in either all cats or the cats with high pre-vaccination titres; and concerning adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: All retrovirus-infected asymptomatic cats had pre-vaccination FPV antibodies indicating protection against panleukopenia. Response of retrovirus-infected cats to vaccination was similar to the response of non-infected cats.","['Bergmann, Michele', 'Schwertler, Stephanie', 'Speck, Stephanie', 'Truyen, Uwe', 'Hartmann, Katrin']","['Bergmann M', 'Schwertler S', 'Speck S', 'Truyen U', 'Hartmann K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8856-3849'],"['Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, LMU, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, LMU, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, LMU, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', '*Antibody Formation', 'Asymptomatic Infections', 'Cats', 'Feline Panleukopenia/*prevention & control', 'Feline Panleukopenia Virus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests/veterinary', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology', 'Vaccination/*veterinary', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",,,2018/12/18 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2018/12/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X18816463 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2019 Dec;21(12):1094-1101. doi: 10.1177/1098612X18816463.

METHODS: Retrospective study of 262 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AML hospitalized for intensive induction. Hyperglycemia was assessed by mean blood glucose (BG) (mg/dL) during hospitalization and glycemic variability was determined by the standard deviation (SD) of mean BG. Outcomes were complete remission +/- incomplete count recovery (CR + CRi), and overall survival (OS). We used logistic regression to evaluate CR + CRi, and Cox proportional hazard models for OS, stratified by age (< 60 vs >/= 60 years). RESULTS: Older patients (N = 138, median age 70) had higher baseline comorbidity (CCI > 1 60.1% vs 25.8%) and prevalence of diabetes (20.3% vs 7.3%) compared to younger (N = 124, median age 47). The mean +/- SD number of BG values obtained per patient during hospitalization was 61 +/- 71. The mean (+/- SD) glucose (mg/dL) during hospitalization was 121.7 (25.9) in older patients (>/= 60 years) versus 111.6 (16.4) in younger. In older patients, higher mean glucose and greater glycemic variability were associated with lower odds of remission (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93 and OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88 respectively, per 10-unit increase) and higher mortality rates (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.21 and HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.26, respectively, per 10-unit increase) in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations that hyperglycemia and increased glycemic variability were associated with lower remission rates and increased mortality in older patients suggest glycemic control may be a potentially modifiable factor to improve AML outcomes.","['Kuhlman, Patrick', 'Isom, Scott', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Burns, Cynthia', 'Tawfik, Bernard', 'Lamar, Zanetta S', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Klepin, Heidi D']","['Kuhlman P', 'Isom S', 'Pardee TS', 'Burns C', 'Tawfik B', 'Lamar ZS', 'Powell BL', 'Klepin HD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6262-1123'],"['Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA. hklepin@wakehealth.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30CA012197/National Cancer Institute', 'K23 AG038361/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'K23AG038361/National Institute on Aging', 'P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA197991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose/*metabolism', 'Comorbidity', 'Diabetes Mellitus/blood', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6571065,['NIHMS1013835'],2018/12/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2018/12/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-018-4582-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-018-4582-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Aug;27(8):2877-2884. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4582-6.

Recent studies have demonstrated that HDAC and BRD4 participate in the regulation of some signal paths like PI3K-AKT. In this work, a series of indole derivatives that combine the inhibitory activities of BRD4 and HDAC into one molecule were designed and synthesized through the structure-based design method. Most compounds showed potent HDAC inhibitory activity and moderate BRD4 inhibitory activity. In vitro anti-proliferation activities of the synthesized compounds were also evaluated. Among them, 19f was the most potent inhibitor against HDAC3 with IC50 value of 5nM and BRD4 inhibition rate of 88% at 10muM. It was confirmed that 19f could up-regulate the expression of Ac-H3 and reduce the expression of c-Myc by western blot analysis. These results indicated that 19f was a potent dual HDAC/BRD4 inhibitor and deserved further investigation.","['Cheng, Gaoliang', 'Wang, Zhi', 'Yang, Jinyu', 'Bao, Yu', 'Xu, Qihao', 'Zhao, Linxiang', 'Liu, Dan']","['Cheng G', 'Wang Z', 'Yang J', 'Bao Y', 'Xu Q', 'Zhao L', 'Liu D']",,"['Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drugs Design & Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this prospective, multicenter study, patients undergoing ASCT for relapsed/refractory lymphoma received peritransplant IFRT to disease sites identified at study registration (SR) (before salvage chemotherapy [SC]). Radiation dose was adapted to SC response. Survival, relapse rates/pattern, toxicity, and prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled (23 with Hodgkin lymphoma, 22 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Three-year overall survival and cumulative incidence of posttransplant progression rates were 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59%-87%) and 42% (95% CI, 27%-57%), respectively. Stage (P = .03) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (P = .05) were significant risk factors for disease progression on multivariable analysis. Three-year actuarial in-field, marginal, and distant progression rates were 7% (95% CI, 0%-15%), 9% (95% CI, 0%-18%), and 36% (95% CI, 21%-51%), respectively. Progression occurred in 8 of 30 patients with all sites irradiated and in 13 of 15 patients without all sites irradiated. There were 117 disease sites at SR and 64 post-ASCT progression sites, of which 15 were involved at SR and 12 only at initial diagnosis. Posttransplant relapse occurred in 3 of 83 irradiated and 12 of 34 unirradiated involved sites. Of 28 sites in complete response to SC on computed tomography, there was no relapse in any of the 21 irradiated sites and in 1 of 7 unirradiated sites. Of 72 sites in complete response on positron emission tomography, relapse occurred in 1 of 50 irradiated and 10 of 22 unirradiated sites. No grade 4 nonhematologic radiation therapy toxicities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: IFRT was well tolerated and associated with a low rate of in-field progression. Progression rates were lower for patients with all disease sites irradiated. Response to SC on both computed tomography and positron emission tomography warrants further study to select sites for IFRT.","['Wirth, Andrew', 'Prince, H Miles', 'Roos, Daniel', 'Gibson, John', ""O'Brien, Peter"", 'Zannino, Diana', 'Khodr, Bereha', 'Stone, Janey M', 'Davis, Sidney', 'Hertzberg, Mark']","['Wirth A', 'Prince HM', 'Roos D', 'Gibson J', ""O'Brien P"", 'Zannino D', 'Khodr B', 'Stone JM', 'Davis S', 'Hertzberg M']",,"['Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Recurrent heterozygous mutations in SMC3 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies. In this study, we investigated whether the missense mutations in SMC3 might have dominant-negative effects or phenocopy loss-of-function effects by comparing the consequences of Smc3-deficient and -haploinsufficient mouse models. We found that homozygous deletion of Smc3 during embryogenesis or in adult mice led to hematopoietic failure, suggesting that SMC3 missense mutations are unlikely to be associated with simple dominant-negative phenotypes. In contrast, haploinsufficiency was tolerated during embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. Under steady-state conditions, Smc3 haploinsufficiency did not alter colony forming in methylcellulose, only modestly decreased mature myeloid cell populations, and led to limited expression changes and chromatin alteration in Lin(-)cKit(+) bone marrow cells. However, following transplantation, engraftment, and subsequent deletion, we observed a hematopoietic competitive disadvantage across myeloid and lymphoid lineages and within the stem/progenitor compartments. This disadvantage was not affected by hematopoietic stresses, but was partially abrogated by concurrent Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency, suggesting that antecedent mutations may be required to optimize the leukemogenic potential of Smc3 mutations.","['Wang, Tianjiao', 'Glover, Brandi', 'Hadwiger, Gayla', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'di Martino, Orsola', 'Welch, John S']","['Wang T', 'Glover B', 'Hadwiger G', 'Miller CA', 'di Martino O', 'Welch JS']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA; McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.

When exposed to high glucose (HG), retinal epithelial cells undergo profound alterations both morphologically and functionally in a well-conserved process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism governing HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells is not completely understood. Here we report that treatment with 25mM glucose led to EMT in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) characterized by a simultaneous down-regulation of E-Cadherin (encoded by CDH1) and up-regulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (encoded by ACTA2). HG-induced EMT in RPEs was accompanied by augmented expression and enhanced nuclear enrichment of MKL1, a transcriptional modulator. In contrast, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or inhibition by CCG-1423 abrogated HG-induced EMT in RPEs. Of interest, MKL1 mediated the transcriptional activation of LOX, a mesenchymal marker, in RPEs in response to HG stimulation. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited by AP-1 to the proximal LOX promoter to promote LOX trans-activation likely through altering the chromatin structure. Finally, LOX depletion by siRNA or inhibition by aminopropionitrile in RPEs abolished HG-induced EMT. In conclusion, our data support a role for MKL1 in mediating HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells via epigenetic activation of LOX transcription.","['Ding, Yuhua', 'Xu, Huihui', 'Li, Luyang', 'Yuan, Yibiao', 'Xu, Yong']","['Ding Y', 'Xu H', 'Li L', 'Yuan Y', 'Xu Y']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, The First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'The Laboratory Center for Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

In a previous multicenter study we developed protocols to accurately define leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) at diagnosis. It has, however, not been demonstrated whether the use of the defined LAIPs in the same multicenter setting results in a high concordance between centers in MRD assessment. In the present paper we evaluated whether interpretation of list-mode data (LMD) files, obtained from MRD assessment of previously determined LAIPs during and after treatment, could reliably be performed in a multicenter setting. The percentage of MRD positive cells was simultaneously determined in totally 173 LMD files from 77 AML patients by six participating centers. The quantitative concordance between the six participating centers was meanly 84%, with slight variation of 75%-89%. In addition our data showed that the type and number of LAIPs were of influence on the performance outcome. The highest concordance was observed for LAIPs with cross-lineage expression, followed by LAIPs with an asynchronous antigen expression. Our results imply that immunophenotypic MRD assessment in AML will only be feasible when fully standardized methods are used for reliable multicenter assessment.","['Brooimans, Rik A', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Boeckx, Nancy', 'Slomp, Jennita', 'Preijers, Frank', 'Te Marvelde, Jeroen G', 'Van, Ngoc M', 'Heijs, Antoinette', 'Huys, Erik', 'van der Holt, Bronno', 'de Greef, Georgine E', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan']","['Brooimans RA', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'Boeckx N', 'Slomp J', 'Preijers F', 'Te Marvelde JG', 'Van NM', 'Heijs A', 'Huys E', 'van der Holt B', 'de Greef GE', 'Kelder A', 'Schuurhuis GJ']",,"['Department of Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Laboratory of Clinical and Tumor Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

We studied its pharmacokinetic interactions with the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, using in vitro transport assays and knockout and transgenic mouse models. Quizartinib was transported by human ABCB1 in vitro, and by mouse (m)Abcb1 and mAbcg2 in vivo. Upon oral administration, the brain accumulation of quizartinib was 6-fold decreased by mAbcb1 and 2-fold by mAbcg2 (together: 12-fold). Unexpectedly, the absence of mAbcb1 resulted in a approximately 2-fold lower plasma exposure in Abcb1a/1b(-/-) and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice, suggesting that loss of mAbcb1 causes compensatory alterations in alternative quizartinib elimination or uptake systems. mAbcb1 and mAbcg2 themselves did not appear to restrict quizartinib oral availability. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of quizartinib were not substantially altered between wild-type, Cyp3a knockout and CYP3A4-humanized mice. All three strains showed relatively high (33-51%) oral bioavailability. If this also applies in humans, this would suggest a limited risk of CYP3A-related inter-individual variation in exposure for this drug. Our results provide a possible rationale for using pharmacological ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitors together with quizartinib when treating malignant lesions situated in part or in whole behind the blood-brain barrier.","['Wang, Jing', 'Gan, Changpei', 'Retmana, Irene A', 'Sparidans, Rolf W', 'Li, Wenlong', 'Lebre, Maria C', 'Beijnen, Jos H', 'Schinkel, Alfred H']","['Wang J', 'Gan C', 'Retmana IA', 'Sparidans RW', 'Li W', 'Lebre MC', 'Beijnen JH', 'Schinkel AH']",,"['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Utrecht University, Faculty of Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology & Clinical Pharmacology, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Utrecht University, Faculty of Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology & Clinical Pharmacology, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Utrecht University, Faculty of Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology & Clinical Pharmacology, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands; The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Slotervaart Hospital, Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Pharmacology, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Binding of its ligand, FLT3 ligand (FL), induces dimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This leads to autophosphorylation of FLT3 on several tyrosine residues which constitute high affinity binding sites for signal transduction molecules. Recruitment of these signal transduction molecules to FLT3 leads to the activation of several signal transduction pathways that regulate cell survival, cell proliferation and differentiation. Oncogenic, constitutively active mutants of FLT3 are known to be expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and to correlate with poor prognosis. Activation of the receptor mediates cell survival, cell proliferation and differentiation of cells. Several of the signal transduction pathways downstream of FLT3 have been shown to include various members of the SRC family of kinases (SFKs). They are involved in regulating the activity of RAS/ERK pathways through the scaffolding protein GAB2 and the adaptor protein SHC. They are also involved in negative regulation of signaling through phosphorylation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase CBL. Initially studied as the SFKs, as if they were a homogenous group of kinases, recent data suggest that each SFK has its own specific signaling capabilities where some are involved in positive signaling, while others are involved in negative signaling. This review discusses some recent insights into how SFKs are involved in FLT3 signaling.","['Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L']",,"['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Division of Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

SMFS approved the high selectivity of the sgc8c aptamers to the PTK7 receptors at the cell surface and allowed determining the binding probability of the aptamers to the PTK7 receptors at different cell lines.","['Poturnayova, Alexandra', 'Burikova, Monika', 'Bizik, Jozef', 'Hianik, Tibor']","['Poturnayova A', 'Burikova M', 'Bizik J', 'Hianik T']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5906-0548'],"['Department of Nuclear Physics and Biophysics Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius University Mlynska dolina F1, 842 48, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Center of Biosciences SAS Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center SAS, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center SAS, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Department of Nuclear Physics and Biophysics Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius University Mlynska dolina F1, 842 48, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['APVV-14-0267/Slovak Research and Development Agency/International', '1/0152/15/Science Grant Agency VEGA/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chemphyschem,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,100954211,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acoustics', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry']",,,2018/12/16 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/12/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cphc.201801126 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemphyschem. 2019 Feb 18;20(4):545-554. doi: 10.1002/cphc.201801126.

This protein can be targeted by JQ1, a selective small-molecule inhibitor. However, few studies have investigated whether BRD4 influenced acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and whether BRD4 had interaction with promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein to some extent. Results from cell viability assay, cell cycle analysis, and Annexin-V/PI analysis indicated that JQ1 inhibited the growth of NB4 cells, an APL-derived cell line, and induced NB4 cell cycle arrest at G1 and apoptosis. Then, we used co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay and immunoblot to demonstrate the endogenous interaction of BRD4 and PML/RARalpha in NB4 cells. Moreover, downregulation of PML/RARalpha at the mRNA and protein levels was observed upon JQ1 treatment. Furthermore, results from the RT-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR, and re-ChIP-qPCR assays showed that BRD4 and PML/RARalpha co-existed on the same regulatory regions of their target genes. Hence, we showed a new discovery of the interaction of BRD4 and PML/RARalpha, as well as the decline of PML/RARalpha expression, under JQ1 treatment.","['Luo, Qun', 'Deng, Wanglong', 'Wang, Haiwei', 'Fan, Huiyong', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Luo Q', 'Deng W', 'Wang H', 'Fan H', 'Zhang J']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Graduate School, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. jizhang@sibs.ac.cn.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Graduate School, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200025, China. jizhang@sibs.ac.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/12/16 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2018/12/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11684-017-0604-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-017-0604-x [pii]']",ppublish,Front Med. 2018 Dec;12(6):726-734. doi: 10.1007/s11684-017-0604-x.

Since 10% of patients have no suitable PCR-marker, we evaluated flowcytometry (FCM)-based MRD for risk stratification. We included 274 T-ALL patients treated in the NOPHO-ALL2008 protocol. MRD was measured by six-color FCM and real-time quantitative PCR. Day 29 PCR-MRD (cut-off 10(-3)) was used for risk stratification. At diagnosis, 93% had an FCM-marker for MRD monitoring, 84% a PCR-marker, and 99.3% (272/274) had a marker when combining the two. Adjusted for age and WBC, the hazard ratio for relapse was 3.55 (95% CI 1.4-9.0, p = 0.008) for day 29 FCM-MRD >/= 10(-3) and 5.6 (95% CI 2.0-16, p = 0.001) for PCR-MRD >/= 10(-3) compared with MRD < 10(-3). Patients stratified to intermediate-risk therapy on day 29 with MRD 10(-4)-<10(-3) had a 5-year event-free survival similar to intermediate-risk patients with MRD < 10(-4) or undetectable, regardless of method for monitoring. Patients with day 15 FCM-MRD < 10(-4) had a cumulative incidence of relapse of 2.3% (95% CI 0-6.8, n = 59). Thus, FCM-MRD allows early identification of patients eligible for reduced intensity therapy, but this needs further studies. In conclusion, FCM-MRD provides reliable risk prediction for T-ALL and can be used for stratification when no PCR-marker is available.","['Modvig, S', 'Madsen, H O', 'Siitonen, S M', 'Rosthoj, S', 'Tierens, A', 'Juvonen, V', 'Osnes, L T N', 'Valerhaugen, H', 'Hultdin, M', 'Thorn, I', 'Matuzeviciene, R', 'Stoskus, M', 'Marincevic, M', 'Fogelstrand, L', 'Lilleorg, A', 'Toft, N', 'Jonsson, O G', 'Pruunsild, K', 'Vaitkeviciene, G', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Lund, B', 'Abrahamsson, J', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Marquart, H V']","['Modvig S', 'Madsen HO', 'Siitonen SM', 'Rosthoj S', 'Tierens A', 'Juvonen V', 'Osnes LTN', 'Valerhaugen H', 'Hultdin M', 'Thorn I', 'Matuzeviciene R', 'Stoskus M', 'Marincevic M', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Lilleorg A', 'Toft N', 'Jonsson OG', 'Pruunsild K', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Vettenranta K', 'Lund B', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Marquart HV']",,"['Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Helsinki University Ctrl.

Whether optimal duration of venetoclax treatment can be guided by minimal residual disease (MRD) is currently unknown. To study whether TLS risk can be mitigated in an unfit population by introducing preinduction, and whether MRD-guided duration of venetoclax treatment is a feasible and efficacious approach, we performed the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hemato-oncology (HOVON) 139/GIVE trial. The study treatment consists of 4 treatment phases: preinduction (2 cycles obinutuzumab), induction I (6 cycles obinutuzumab and venetoclax), induction II (6 cycles venetoclax), and a randomization phase (group A: maintenance with 12 additional cycles of venetoclax irrespective of MRD; group B: MRD guided venetoclax maintenance with a maximum of 12 cycles). Here we report on a planned interim safety analysis as well as preliminary efficacy and MRD data of the first 30 patients enrolled. Downgrading of TLS risk after preinduction occurred in 25 patients: 3 from high to medium, 3 from high to low, and 19 from medium to low risk. No patient remained high risk. From these 30 patients, peripheral blood MRD data were obtained for 28 patients at the end of induction II (6 months after the last obinutuzumab dose), of whom 26 had undetectable MRD levels, and for 18 patients who reached the 3-month after-randomization point, of whom 16 had undetectable MRD levels. Obinutuzumab preinduction is tolerated well in these unfit patients and results in abrogating high TLS risk in all patients. Preliminary data indicate that efficacy is maintained with a high proportion of patients with undetectable MRD levels after combination treatment.","['Kater, Arnon P', 'Kersting, Sabina', 'van Norden, Yvette', 'Dubois, Julie', 'Dobber, Johan A', 'Mellink, Clemens H', 'Evers, Ludo M', 'Croon-de Boer, Fransien', 'Schreurs, John', 'van der Spek, Ellen', 'Visser, Hein', 'Idink, Cecile', 'Wittebol, Shulamiet', 'Hoogendoorn, Mels', 'Tonino, Sanne H', 'Mobasher, Mehrdad', 'Levin, Mark-David']","['Kater AP', 'Kersting S', 'van Norden Y', 'Dubois J', 'Dobber JA', 'Mellink CH', 'Evers LM', 'Croon-de Boer F', 'Schreurs J', 'van der Spek E', 'Visser H', 'Idink C', 'Wittebol S', 'Hoogendoorn M', 'Tonino SH', 'Mobasher M', 'Levin MD']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891'],"['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, HAGA Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Special Hematology and.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Special Hematology and.', 'Internal Medicine, Ikazia Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Martini Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Northwest Clinics, Alkmaar, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, ZorgSaam Hospital, Terneuzen, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Gelderland Valley Hospital, Ede, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Medical Center Leeuwarden, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA; and.', 'Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/etiology']",PMC6306887,,2018/12/16 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/12/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018019422 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Dec 26;2(24):3566-3571. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019422.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['HOVON CLL study group.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes our findings to date, including the frequency with which mutational testing led to precision-guided therapy and outcome for those patients. METHODS: Eligible patients presenting to Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cancer Institute were enrolled on the study. Patients with biopsy proven metastatic or locally advanced unresectable prostate cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia receiving standard of care therapy were eligible. Metastatic site biopsies were collected and analyzed using the Knight Diagnostic Lab GeneTrails comprehensive solid tumor panel (124 genes). CLIA certified genomic information was made available to the treating physician. RESULTS: Between 1/26/2017 and 5/30/2018, 38 patients were enrolled, with 28 successfully undergoing biopsy. Of these, 25 samples yielded sufficient tumor for analysis. The median biopsy cellularity and number of cores collected were 70% (15-90%) and 5 (2-20), respectively. No procedure-related complications occurred. GeneTrails analysis revealed that 22 of 25 (88%) tumor samples harbored at least one potentially actionable mutation, and 18 (72%) samples harbored 2 or more potentially actionable mutations. The most common genetic alterations identified involved: DNA damage repair genes, cell cycle regulating genes, PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR pathway, and FGF gene family.

Owing to variation in differential diagnosis, pathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical staining are essential for definitive diagnosis. Rarely, MS has been shown as an isolated extramedullary relapse (iEMR) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), which often does not necessarily result in bone marrow involvement. It seems that despite chemotherapy and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects on bone marrow, leukemic cells could remain alive in the extra-medullary region. However, in order to achieve longer survival, timely diagnosis as well as combined systemic, local, and cellular therapeutic modalities should be considered in any patient with iEMR after allo-SCT. We report a left lateral neck isolated MS presented as acute otitis externa in a patient with prior allo-SCT due to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, MS should be considered in patients with any history of acute leukemia even if the patient presents with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease.","['Mozafari, Rambod', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Sotoude, Hamed', 'Asadollahi-Amin, Ali']","['Mozafari R', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Sotoude H', 'Asadollahi-Amin A']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Iranian Research Center for HIV/AIDS (IRCHA), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neck/pathology', 'Otitis Externa/*etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2018/12/16 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/12/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['S1029-2977-21(11)544-0 [pii]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2018 Nov 1;21(11):544-546.,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

However, apoptotic effects and mechanisms of 23-HUA have not been well characterized yet. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of 23-HUA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. 23-HUA-treated HL-60 cells showed apoptotic features including internucleosomal DNA condensation and fragmentation as well as externalization of phosphatidylserine residues. 23-HUA induced a series of mitochondrial events including disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release and loss of balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in HL-60 cells. In addition, 23-HUA activated caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3. Pretreatment with a broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), a caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk), and a caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) significantly attenuated 23-HUA-induced DNA fragmentation. After 23-HUA-induced apoptosis, proteins expression levels of FasL, Fas and FADD constituting the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) were upregulated in HL-60 cells. Moreover, transfection with Fas or FADD siRNA significantly blocked 23-HUA-induced DNA fragmentation and caspases activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that 23-HUA induces apoptosis in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells through formation of DISC and caspase-8 activation leading to loss of DeltaPsim and caspase-3 activation.","['Won, Jong-Heon', 'Chung, Kyung-Sook', 'Park, Eun-Young', 'Lee, Jeong-Hun', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Tapondjou, Leon Azefack', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Nomura, Masaaki', 'Hassan, Ahmed H E', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Won JH', 'Chung KS', 'Park EY', 'Lee JH', 'Choi JH', 'Tapondjou LA', 'Park HJ', 'Nomura M', 'Hassan AHE', 'Lee KT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1048-6281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3141-3727']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ppoi788@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. adella76@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. evolutioner@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ztztzt08@hanmail.net.', 'Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ztztzt08@hanmail.net.', 'Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. jchoi@khu.ac.kr.', 'Oriental Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. jchoi@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Box 183, Dschang, Cameroon. tapondjou2001@yahoo.fr.', 'Division of Applied Plant Sciences, Sang-Ji University, Wonju 220-702, Korea. hjpark@sangji.ac.kr.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokuriku University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-1181, Japan. m-nomura@hokuriku-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ahmed_hassan@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt. ahmed_hassan@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ktlee@khu.ac.kr.', 'Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea. ktlee@khu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['NRF-2017R1A5A2014768/National Research Foundation of Korea'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1I1MDP27ZG (23-hydroxyursolic acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Araliaceae/*chemistry', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Plant Bark/*chemistry', 'Plant Stems/*chemistry', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",PMC6321063,,2018/12/16 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/12/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23123306 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23123306 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 Dec 13;23(12). pii: molecules23123306. doi: 10.3390/molecules23123306.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['23-hydroxyursolic acid', 'Bcl-2', 'apoptosis', 'caspase', 'death-inducing signaling complex', 'mitochondria']",,,20181213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in molecular diagnostics that can analyze the individual tumor's variability in genes have provided greater understanding and additional strategies to treat cancers. Although tumors can be tested by several molecular methods, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly facilitated our understanding of pediatric cancer and identified additional therapeutic opportunities. Pediatric tumors have a different genetic make-up, with a fewer number of actionable targets than adult tumors. Nevertheless, precision oncology in the pediatric population has greatly improved the survival of patients with leukemia and solid tumors.

High incidence of OS has gradually become a social problem. Recent years, numerous studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in the tumor progression. As a member of lncRNA family, MIR100HG has been reported to be an oncogene in breast cancer and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, the specific role of MIR100HG in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the biological function and molecular mechanism of MIR100HG in the progression of osteosarcoma. At first, we measured the high expression of MIR100HG in OS tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier method revealed that high expression of MIR100HG is a factor for the poor prognosis of OS patients (P = 0.004). To explore the effect of MIR100HG on the biological processes of OS, loss-of-function assays were conducted in OS cells. Functionally, MIR100HG knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, cell cycle progression while promoted cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, MIR100HG was upregulated by the transcription factor ELK1. The upregulation of MIR100HG led to the inactivation of Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we found that MIR100HG inactivated Hippo pathway in OS cells by epigenetically silencing LATS1 and LATS2. Rescue assays demonstrated that LATS1/2 involved in MIR100HG-mediated OS progression. In summary, our study indicated that ELK1-induced upregulation of MIR100HG promoted OS progression by epigenetically silencing LATS1 and LATS2 and inactivating Hippo pathway.","['Su, Xiaochuan', 'Teng, Junyan', 'Jin, Guoguo', 'Li, Jitian', 'Zhao, Zhenjiang', 'Cao, Xiangyang', 'Guo, Yanxing', 'Guo, Malong', 'Li, Xiaoling', 'Wu, Jun', 'Wang, Chuanzhen', 'Guo, Zhiping', 'Guo, Qing']","['Su X', 'Teng J', 'Jin G', 'Li J', 'Zhao Z', 'Cao X', 'Guo Y', 'Guo M', 'Li X', 'Wu J', 'Wang C', 'Guo Z', 'Guo Q']",,"['Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Laboratory of Bone Tumor, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Laboratory of Bone Tumor, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Department of Osteoarthrosis & Health Management Center, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, Henan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.', 'Laboratory of Bone Tumor, Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital, No.100, Yongping Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450046, China.

CD20 is involved in the regulation of trans-membrane Ca(2+) conductance and also play critical roles in cell-cycle progression during human B cell proliferation and activation. The appearance of monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology provided an effective field for targeted therapy in treatment of a variety of diseases such as cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Anti-CD20 is one of important antibodies which could be employed in treatment of several diseases. Increasing evidences revealed that efficacy of different anti-CD20 antibodies is implicated by their function. Hence, evaluation of anti-CD20 antibodies function could provide and introduce new anti-CD20 based therapies. In the present study, we summarized several applications of anti-CD20 antibodies in various immune related disorders including B-CLL (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS) and melanoma.","['Payandeh, Zahra', 'Bahrami, Armina Alagheband', 'Hoseinpoor, Reyhaneh', 'Mortazavi, Yousef', 'Rajabibazl, Masoumeh', 'Rahimpour, Azam', 'Taromchi, Amir Hossein', 'Khalil, Saeed']","['Payandeh Z', 'Bahrami AA', 'Hoseinpoor R', 'Mortazavi Y', 'Rajabibazl M', 'Rahimpour A', 'Taromchi AH', 'Khalil S']",,"['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.

However, the molecular function and the relationship of PHF6 mutation with glucocorticoid drug resistance during T-ALL treatment remains elusive. Here we report the influence of PHF6 expression on the drug response of T-ALL to prednisolone, and the underlying mechanism of this. Through sanger sequencing and western blotting assays, we identified two T-ALL cell lines with wild-type PHF6 expression, including SIL-ALL and CCRF-CEM, and two T-ALL cell lines without PHF6 expression, including TALL-1 and HPB-ALL, due to the nonsense and frameshift mutations in the coding region of PHF6. MTT assays showed that SIL-ALL and CCRF-CEM were much more sensitive to prednisolone. However, TALL-1 and HPB-ALL were much more resistance to prednisolone. Further knockout of PHF6 led to the resistant of both SIL-ALL and CCRF-CEM cells to prednisolone. On the contrary, the correction of the PHF6 point mutation in HPB-ALL cells with CRISPR-CAS9 method increased the sensibility of both cell lines to prednisolone. Then we found that PHF6 repress p21 expression through direct binding and recruiting RBPP4 to its promoter region. Finally, the co-treatment of p21 inhibitor increased the sensitivity of TALL-1 and HPB-ALL cells to prednisolone. Collectively, our findings not only enrich our understanding of the relationship between PHF6 mutation and drug resistance but also indicate a new therapeutic potential for those T-ALL patients containing the PHF6 mutation.","['Xiang, Jinfeng', 'Wang, Gang', 'Xia, Tian', 'Chen, Zhixin']","['Xiang J', 'Wang G', 'Xia T', 'Chen Z']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Nanyang City Center Hospital, Nanyang, 473000, HeNan, China.

BCRP mediates efflux of numerous xenobiotics, including various chemotherapeutic agents and photosensitizers. Hypericin (HY) is a naturally-occurring photosensitizer synthesized by plants of the genus Hypericum. Our recently published results indicate that accumulation of HY in cancer cells of different tissue origin can be affected mostly by BCRP. Considering all known facts, the main goal of this study was to verify whether not only HY accumulation but also toxicity of HY-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be affected by the presence of some ABC transporters. To specifically prove our hypothesis, we used an experimental model of human leukemia cell lines differing in the expression level of the main drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and BCRP. The lowest HY accumulation, and consequently the highest resistance to HY-PDT, was found in cells overexpressing BCRP. Moreover, pretreatment with BCRP inhibitor Ko143 significantly increased HY accumulation and sensitized cells to HY-PDT. Therefore, our findings represent direct evidence that BCRP is the nemesis of HY accumulation and toxicity of HY-PDT. Thus, we should emphasize that individualized screening for BCRP expression and activity may represent a useful tool for prediction of HY-mediated photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) or PDT effectiveness.","['Jendzelovsky, Rastislav', 'Jendzelovska, Zuzana', 'Kucharova, Barbora', 'Fedorocko, Peter']","['Jendzelovsky R', 'Jendzelovska Z', 'Kucharova B', 'Fedorocko P']",,"['Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Faculty of Science, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, Srobarova 2, 041 54 Kosice, Slovakia.

Formononetin (FM), one kind ingredient of Chinese herbal medicine, has been suggested to inhibit MCF-7 breast cancer cells. And recently metformin (MET) has gained more attention as a potential anti-cancer drug. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic effects of FM and MET on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells and to clarify the possible molecular mechanism involved. MCF-7 cells were treated with various concentrations of FM (40 and 80 muM) or FM (40 and 80 muM) combined with MET (150 muM) for 48 h. Cell proliferation was tested by an methyl tetrazolium (MTT) (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by flow cytometry. The expression level of b-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) mRNA was examined by RT-PCR, while the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK1/2) and bcl-2 protein were detected by Western blotting. Compared with untreated cells, 40 muM and 80 muM FM efficiently inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Additionally, 40 muM and 80 muM FM greatly downregulated bcl-2 mRNA expression when compared with untreated cells. Furthermore, the protein expression of bcl-2 and p-ERK1/2 was significantly reduced by 40 muM and 80 muM FM. The cytotoxic effect of FM was more remarkable when 150 muM MET was added. Taken together, the combinational use of FM and MET enhanced cell growth inhibition, and the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells mediated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.","['Xin, Min', 'Wang, Yong', 'Ren, Qianyao', 'Guo, Yanhong']","['Xin M', 'Wang Y', 'Ren Q', 'Guo Y']",,"['Department of Physiology, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 541004, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 541004, PR China; Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 541004, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 541004, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, Guilin Medical University, Guilin 541004, PR China.

In the present study, we investigate the functional role of TUG1 in Adriamycin (ADR) resistance of AML and discover the underlying molecular mechanism. Our study revealed that TUG1 was up-regulated in ADR-resistant AML tissues and cells. High TUG1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis of AML patients. TUG1 knockdown improved the sensitivity of HL60/ADR cells to ADR. Moreover, TUG1 could epigenetically suppress miR-34a expression via recruiting Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). miR-34a overexpression could mimic the functional role of down-regulated TUG1 in ADR resistance. miR-34a knockdown counteracted the inductive effect of TUG1 inhibition on ADR sensitivity of HL60/ADR cells. Furthermore, TUG1 knockdown facilitated ADR sensitivity of ADR-resistant AML cells in vivo. In summary, TUG1 knockdown overcame ADR resistance of AML by epigenetically enhancing miR-34a expression, providing a novel therapeutic target for AML.","['Li, Qun', 'Song, Wei', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Li Q', 'Song W', 'Wang J']",,"[""Pediatric Intensive Care Units, Shangqiu first People's Hospital, Shangqiu, 476100, China."", ""Pediatric Intensive Care Units, Shangqiu first People's Hospital, Shangqiu, 476100, China."", ""Pediatric Intensive Care Units, Shangqiu first People's Hospital, Shangqiu, 476100, China.

At first, we found that lncRNA HOXA-AS2 was highly expressed both in prednisone insensitive ALL cell lines and patient samples. Gain or loss-of-function assays revealed that HOXA-AS2 enhanced GC resistance via promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy among pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). METHODS: We built a microsimulation model for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL receiving either CAR-T therapy or standard of care. Outcomes included costs, quality of life (health utility), complications, and survival. We measured cost-effectiveness with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) considered cost effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test model uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared to standard of care, CAR-T therapy increased overall cost by $528 200 and improved effectiveness by 8.18 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $64 600/QALY. The model was sensitive to assumptions about long-term CAR-T survival, the complete remission rate of CAR-T patients, and the health utility of long-term survivors. The base model assumed a 76.0% one-year survival with CAR-T, although if this decreased to 57.8%, then CAR-T was no longer cost effective. If the complete remission rate of CAR-T recipients decreased from 81% to 56.2%, or if the health utility of disease-free survivors decreased from 0.94 to 0.66, then CAR-T was no longer cost effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that CAR-T was cost effective in 94.8% of iterations at a willingness to pay of $100 000/QALY. CONCLUSION: CAR-T therapy may represent a cost-effective option for pediatric relapsed/refractory B-ALL, although longer follow-up of CAR-T survivors is required to confirm validity of these findings.","['Sarkar, Reith R', 'Gloude, Nicholas J', 'Schiff, Deborah', 'Murphy, James D']","['Sarkar RR', 'Gloude NJ', 'Schiff D', 'Murphy JD']",,"['University of California San Diego School of Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'University of California San Diego School of Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA."", 'University of California San Diego School of Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA."", 'University of California San Diego School of Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*economics', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/economics/genetics/pathology', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",PMC6624167,,2018/12/15 06:00,2020/07/09 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['5240701 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djy193 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Jul 1;111(7):719-726. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djy193.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Melatonin has been proven to exert anti-tumor activity, but the effect of melatonin on MLL-r leukemia and the underlying mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, melatonin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by activating the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in MLL-r leukemia cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that melatonin suppressed the expression of hTERT by abrogating the binding activity of RBFOX3 to the hTERT promoter. Melatonin also blocked NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and suppressed NF-kappaB binding to the COX-2 promoter, thereby suppressing the expression of COX-2. In addition, clinical samples revealed that melatonin exerts anti-leukemic activity in primary MLL-r leukemia blasts ex vivo. In vivo, the mice treated with melatonin experienced a larger reduction in leukemic burden than the control group in a MLL-r leukemia xenograft mouse model. Collectively, these results suggest that melatonin inhibits MLL-rearranged leukemia through suppressing the RBFOX3/hTERT and NF-kappaB/COX-2 signaling pathways.

We reevaluated the relationship between CD25 expression and the leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) properties of AML using a patient-derived xenograft model. We divided lineage marker-negative (Lin-) CD34+CD38- or Lin-CD34+ cells from CD25-positive AML into CD25-positive and -negative populations, and then transplanted each population into NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/Sz mice. Leukemic engraftment was observed with both CD25-positive and -negative populations from three of nine CD25-positive AML patients. In two of those three patients, CD25-positive and -negative Lin-CD34+ cells engrafted at the primary transplantation led to leukemic engraftment at the secondary transplantation, in which engrafted cells contained both CD25-positive and -negative Lin-CD34+ AML cells. In an in vitro culture system, expression of CD25 was considerably induced in the CD25-negative population of Lin-CD34+ cells from two cases of CD25-positive AML. In one case, CD25-positive Lin-CD34+ cells gave rise to CD25-negative as well as -positive CD34+ cells. These observations suggest that there exist CD25-positive and -negative populations that can reconstitute CD25-positive AML in a patient-derived xenograft model, and that CD25 expression fluctuates in the LICs of AML.","['Kageyama, Yuki', 'Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Arakawa, Rino', 'Tawara, Isao', 'Ohishi, Kohshi', 'Masuya, Masahiro', 'Nakase, Kazunori', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Kageyama Y', 'Miwa H', 'Arakawa R', 'Tawara I', 'Ohishi K', 'Masuya M', 'Nakase K', 'Katayama N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0564-2227'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'School of Medicine, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Cancer Center, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC6294374,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0209295 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-26131 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Dec 14;13(12):e0209295. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0209295. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181214,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hearing loss has only sporadically been reported in survivors of childhood AML. We assessed hearing status in survivors of childhood AML treated with chemotherapy alone according to 3 consecutive NOPHO-AML trials. PROCEDURE: A population-based cohort of children treated according to the NOPHO-AML-84, NOPHO-AML-88, and NOPHO-AML-93 trials included 137 eligible survivors among whom 101 (74%) completed a questionnaire and 99 (72%) had otologic and audiologic examination performed including otoscopy (72%), pure tone audiometry (70%), and tympanometry (60%). Eighty-four of 93 (90%) eligible sibling controls completed a similar questionnaire. RESULTS: At a median of 11 years (range, 4 to 25) after diagnosis, hearing disorders were rare in survivors of childhood AML and in sibling controls, with no significant differences. None had severe or profound hearing loss diagnosed at audiometry. Audiometry detected a subclinical hearing loss ranging from slight to moderate in 19% of the survivors, 5% had low-frequency hearing loss, and 17% had high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of hearing disorders was low, and hearing thresholds in survivors of childhood AML were similar to background populations of comparable age.","['Skou, Anne-Sofie', 'Olsen, Steen O', 'Nielsen, Lars H', 'Glosli, Heidi', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jarfelt, Marianne', 'Jonmundsson, Guethmundur K', 'Malmros, Johan', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Skou AS', 'Olsen SO', 'Nielsen LH', 'Glosli H', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jarfelt M', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Malmros J', 'Nysom K', 'Hasle H']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus.', 'Departments of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, and Audiology.', 'Departments of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, and Audiology.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', ""Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Landspitalinn University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital.', ""Department of Women s and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hearing/*drug effects', '*Hearing Disorders/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001302 [doi]', '00043426-201901000-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jan;41(1):e12-e17. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001302.,,['Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, rutin and rosmarinic acid, have many protective roles, but there is no comparative study about these three polyphenolic compounds on ARH-77. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of resveratrol, rutin and rosmarinic acid on ARH-77. Toxic concentration ranges were determined by the brine shrimp lethality test on Artemia salina. In addition, for determination of their cytotoxic effects, MTT and NR methods were used for ARH-77. Resveratrol caused significant reduction in both mitochondrial and lysosomal activities compared with the control group. Maximum inhibition values were detected on mitochondrial and lysosomal activity with 200 pM concentrations after 48 hours. After a 24 hours incubation period, rutin showed cytotoxic effects, particularly with 50, 100 and 200 lM concentrations. Rosmarinic acid also decreased the mitochondrial activity with the same concentrations. Resveratrol showed higher cytotoxic effects than rutin and rosmarinic acid.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and their biosimilars are used to treat anaemia in MDS and, currently, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are commonly used and recommended by clinical guidelines. To better understand the evidence available on the use of ESAs for anaemia in lower-risk MDS, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies reporting on clinical efficacy/effectiveness, patient-reported quality of life (QoL), and safety. We extended our review to include retrospective studies for darbepoetin alfa specifically and to ascertain the feasibility of completing an indirect network meta-analysis comparing epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Overall, 53 articles reporting on 35 studies were included. The studies indicated a clinical benefit of ESAs, with benefits observed across key clinical outcomes. ESAs showed consistent improvement in erythroid response rates (ESA-naive, 45-73%; previous ESA exposure, 25-75%) and duration of response. Comparative studies demonstrated similar progression to acute myeloid leukaemia and several showed improved overall survival and QoL. Limited safety concerns were identified. This analysis confirmed ESA therapy should be the foremost first-line treatment of anaemia in most patients with lower-risk MDS who lack the 5q deletion.","['Park, Sophie', 'Greenberg, Peter', 'Yucel, Aylin', 'Farmer, Caroline', ""O'Neill, Frank"", 'De Oliveira Brandao, Cisio', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Park S', 'Greenberg P', 'Yucel A', 'Farmer C', ""O'Neill F"", 'De Oliveira Brandao C', 'Fenaux P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0514-5789', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0468-3553']","[""Clinique Universitaire d'Hematologie Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."", 'Stanford University Cancer Center, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Parametric Solutions Inc., London, UK.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital St. Louis and Paris 7 University, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '0 (Hematinics)', '15UQ94PT4P (Darbepoetin alfa)', '64FS3BFH5W (Epoetin Alfa)']",IM,"['Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/*therapeutic use', 'Darbepoetin alfa/*therapeutic use', 'Epoetin Alfa/*therapeutic use', 'Hematinics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15707 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Jan;184(2):134-160. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15707.

A case control study was carried out involving in a total of 131 patients with PTC and 144 healthy controls. Both cases and controls were genotyped for MDM2 309T>G and I/D polymorphisms. There was no significant difference regarding MDM2 309T>G and I/D genotypes between patients with PTC and controls in neither dominant nor recessive and allelic models. The frequency of G-D haplotype was higher in patients with PTC and this haplotype was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk of PTC. The MDM2 309T>G polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of III-IV stages in patients with PTC. The MDM2 ID genotype was significantly higher in patients with PTC less than 40 years and associated with larger tumor size (>/=1 cm). In conclusion, the G-D haplotype but not MDM2 309T>G and I/D polymorphisms were associated with higher risk of PTC. MDM2 309T>G polymorphism was associated with a higher incidence of III-IV stages, however, I/D polymorphism was associated with larger tumor size and a lower age of disease occurrence.","['Maruei-Milan, Rostam', 'Heidari, Zahra', 'Salimi, Saeedeh']","['Maruei-Milan R', 'Heidari Z', 'Salimi S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3987-0268'],"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/*genetics', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27960 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):12934-12940. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27960.

Due to the application of an eradication program, there were fewer reports related to myelocytomatosis or ALV-J in China after 2013. However, there was another breakout almost simultaneously in six provinces of China in February 2018. On-site, 15- to 20-week-old broiler breeder chickens showed depression, paralysis and weight loss. Mortality for certain flocks reached 15%. Sick chickens showed numerous yellow-white neoplasms growing in the sternum, rib and lumbar vertebra and had hepatic and renal metastasis. Histopathological observation showed all neoplasms were myelocytomas, and there were massive myelocyte-like tumour cells in the liver, kidney and bone marrow. To explore the aetiology of this re-outbreak of myelocytomatosis in China, we collected tumour-bearing chickens and isolated six strains of ALV-J (GM0209-1 to -6). Phylogenetic analysis of gp85 and gp37 showed GM0209 strains were clearly distinct from the prototype strain of ADOL-7501, HPRS-103 and NX0101, and there was a mutation, R176G, in the conserved region between hr1 and hr2 regions of gp85, which was not found in other 44 ALV-J strains. The 3'UTR nucleotide sequences of GM0209 isolates showed there was a signature deletion of 11 nt that was also present in 3'UTR sequences of SCDY1 and NHH, two isolates that have a reported association with haemangioma, indicating this deletion could not determine the tumour type induced by ALV-J. Although the eradication program of ALV-J has been successfully applied in China, the outbreak of ALV-J still occurred, and the virus strain spread quickly. Thus, the biocharacteristics and pathogenesis of mutational ALV-J should be further studied.","['Zhou, Defang', 'Xue, Jingwen', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Wang, Guihua', 'Feng, Yongsheng', 'Hu, Liping', 'Shang, Yingli', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Zhou D', 'Xue J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang G', 'Feng Y', 'Hu L', 'Shang Y', 'Cheng Z']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4323-2541'],"[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China."", 'Animal husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute of Qingdao, Qingdao, China.', 'Animal Epidemic Prevention and Control Center of Shandong Province, Jinan, China.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Fund of Shandong ""Double Tops"" Program (2017)', '31672521/Natural Science Foundation of China', 'SDAIT-11-04/Shandong Modern Agricultural Technology & Industry System', '31761133002/China-UK Partnership on Global Food Security: Combating Avian', 'Leukosis Virus Subgroup J for Sustainable Poultry Production', 'BB/R012865/1/China-UK Partnership on Global Food Security: Combating Avian', 'Leukosis Virus Subgroup J for Sustainable Poultry Production']",['Journal Article'],Germany,Transbound Emerg Dis,Transboundary and emerging diseases,101319538,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*physiology', '*Chickens', 'China/epidemiology', 'Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/virology']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tbed.13096 [doi]'],ppublish,Transbound Emerg Dis. 2019 Mar;66(2):622-626. doi: 10.1111/tbed.13096.

It plays an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of GCDA in hepatocarcinogenesis and chemotherapy resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and clonality by Ki-67 and colony-formation assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis were used to measure messenger RNA and protein levels, respectively. Short hairpin RNA was used to silence signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) expression. RESULTS: Bile salts (GCDA) promoted the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (HepG2 and QGY-7703), and GCDA treatment reduced the chemosensitivity of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in HepG2 and QGY-7703 cells. GCDA upregulated the expression of antiapoptosis proteins Mcl-1/Survivin/Bcl-2. GCDA had no discernible effect on basal protein level or subcellular localization of phosphorylated Stat3. 5FU increased the apoptosis of HepG2 cells with silenced Stat3 expression, but GCDA-induced chemoresistance was not reversed. CONCLUSIONS: GCDA-reduced HCC cell chemosensitivity may occur by upregulating antiapoptosis proteins Mcl-1/Survivin/Bcl-2. Stat3 may be a target for enhancing the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but GCDA-induced chemoresistance is independent of Stat3.","['Wang, Chengzhi', 'Yang, Manyi', 'Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Li, Xia', 'Xiao, Xiangcheng', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Jin, Xin', 'Liao, Mingmei']","['Wang C', 'Yang M', 'Zhao J', 'Li X', 'Xiao X', 'Zhang Y', 'Jin X', 'Liao M']",,"[""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Blood Purification Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Blood Purification Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Blood Purification Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hepatobiliary and Enteric Surgery Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '640-79-9 (Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid/*toxicity', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27905 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Jul;234(7):10899-10906. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27905.

Our results showed that dihydroevocarpine-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and G0/G1 arrest in AML cells, and inhibited the tumor growth in an AML xenograft model. Importantly, our study revealed that the dihydroevocarpine treatment inhibited the mTOR pathway via suppressing the mTORC1/2 activity, and thus overcame the protective effect of the BM microenvironment on AML cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that dihydroevocarpine could be used as a potential anti-AML agent alone or a therapeutic adjunct in AML therapy, particularly in the presence of the BM microenvironment.","['Zhang, Silin', 'Xiong, Yunhe', 'Zhang, Yixian', 'Zhao, Hongmei']","['Zhang S', 'Xiong Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6249-0365'],"['Reproductive Medicine Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Urology Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, The Second People's Hospital of Huai'an, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Huaiyin Hospital of Huai'an city, Huai'an, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Evodia/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27974 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):13032-13041. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27974.

Outcomes included timing/correlates of CD4+ recovery and risk of >/=grade 3 infections. Consecutively treated patients (1 April 2014 to 31 January 2017) were included (n = 295),with a median age of 65 years (range 33-92); 57% were 1st line treatments. Median cumulative bendamustine dose was 1080 mg/m(2) (range 140-1440 mg/m(2) ). CD4/CD8/CD19/NK subsets were available for 148 patients. Median follow-up was 24 months. Median times to lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery (>/=1 x 10(9) /l) and CD4+ recovery (>/=0.2 x 10(9) /l) were 26 and 24 months, respectively.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observation studies to summarize the evidence regarding the relation of fertility treatment with childhood cancer risk. A systematic literature search of several databases was conducted through April 2018 to identify relevant studies. The outcomes of interest included overall cancer, haematological malignancies, neural tumours, other solid tumours, and eight specific cancers. The overall risk estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Sixteen cohort and thirteen case-control studies were included. Results showed that children conceived by fertility treatment had significantly higher risk for developing overall cancer (relative risk [RR]: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.32), haematological malignancies (RR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.60) and other solid tumours (RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.16). For specific cancers, fertility treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of leukaemia (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.57) and hepatic tumours (RR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.32, 3.85). Sensitivity analysis validated evidence of the robustness of the findings. The results may demonstrate a possible association between fertility treatment and an increased risk of cancer among the offspring. However, the findings cannot say whether this increased risk is due to the subfertility itself or to the fertility treatment. Further research is needed to address the underlying mechanisms.","['Wang, Tingting', 'Chen, Lizhang', 'Yang, Tubao', 'Wang, Lesan', 'Zhao, Lijuan', 'Zhang, Senmao', 'Ye, Ziwei', 'Chen, Letao', 'Zheng, Zan', 'Qin, Jiabi']","['Wang T', 'Chen L', 'Yang T', 'Wang L', 'Zhao L', 'Zhang S', 'Ye Z', 'Chen L', 'Zheng Z', 'Qin J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9360-4991'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk']",PMC6590158,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32062 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Jun 15;144(12):3001-3013. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32062.

POS derived from AML patients at diagnosis (Dx), relapse (Rx) and remission (Rm) was compared to healthy donor MSCs in terms of their morphology, growth pattern, support of leukemia cell viability and cytokine profile. Compared to control MSCs, POS (Dx/Rx, Rm) demonstrated a reduced proliferation rate (35%), significantly slower expansion, enlarged cell area (3-4-fold) and provided preferential support to leukemic cells of the same individual. Cytokine profiling showed significantly higher secreted phosphoprotein-1 (SPP1) expression in Dx/Rx and Rm POS compared to healthy MSCs. Additionally, the angiopoietin-1 expression was elevated in Dx/Rx POS with a further increase in the AML cell presence.

The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between using a specific G-CSF agent and the risk of MDS/AML among older patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adults aged >65 years who were diagnosed with first primary NHL between 2001 and 2011. With data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the risk of MDS/AML associated with the receipt of G-CSF(filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) in Cox proportional-hazards models, which were stratified according to treatment accounting for confounding by indication. RESULTS: Among 18,245 patients with NHL patients who had a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 56% received chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, and G-CSF was most commonly used in those who received rituximab plus multiple chemotherapy regimens (77%). Subsequent MDS/AML diagnoses were identified in 666 patients (3.7%). A modest increased risk of MDS/AML was observed with the receipt of G-CSF (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.62) and a trend was observed with increasing doses (Ptrend < .01). When specific agents were analyzed, an increased risk of MDS/AML was consistently observed with filgrastim (>/=10 doses: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.25-2.23), but not with pegfilgrastim (>/=10 + doses: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.84-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: A higher of MDS/AML was observed in patients with NHL risk among those who received G-CSF that was specific to the use of filgrastim (>/=10 doses), but not pegfilgrastim. Neutropenia prophylaxis is an essential component of highly effective NHL treatment regimens. The differential risk related to the types of G-CSF agents used warrants further study given their increasing use and newly available, US Food and Drug Administration-approved, biosimilar products.","['Calip, Gregory S', 'Moran, Kellyn M', 'Sweiss, Karen I', 'Patel, Pritesh R', 'Wu, Zhaoju', 'Adimadhyam, Sruthi', 'Lee, Todd A', 'Ko, Naomi Y', 'Quigley, John G', 'Chiu, Brian C-H']","['Calip GS', 'Moran KM', 'Sweiss KI', 'Patel PR', 'Wu Z', 'Adimadhyam S', 'Lee TA', 'Ko NY', 'Quigley JG', 'Chiu BC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7744-3518', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9559-0282']","['Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Epidemiology Program, Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261201000035C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 MD011439/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002003/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000034C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000140C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002002/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003862/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR000048/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Hematologic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Filgrastim/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab/adverse effects', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC6420387,['NIHMS998120'],2018/12/15 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31914 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Apr 1;125(7):1143-1154. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31914.

However, some patients acquire resistance to TKI that is frequently associated with point mutations in BCR-ABL. We previously reported that a medium-chain fatty-acid derivative AIC-47 induced transcriptional suppression of BCR-ABL and perturbation of the Warburg effect, leading to growth inhibition in Ph-positive leukemia cells. Herein, we showed that AIC-47 had anti-leukemic effects in either wild type (WT)- or mutated-BCR-ABL-harboring cells. AIC-47 suppressed transcription of BCR-ABL gene regardless of the mutation through downregulation of transcriptional activator, c-Myc. Reprogramming of the metabolic pathway has been reported to be associated with resistance to anti-cancer drugs; however, we found that a point mutation of BCR-ABL was independent of the profile of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoform expression. Even in T315I-mutated cells, AIC-47 induced switching of the expression profile of PKM isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1, suggesting that AIC-47 disrupted the Warburg effect. In a leukemic mouse model, AIC-47 greatly suppressed the increase in BCR-ABL mRNA level and improved hepatosplenomegaly regardless of the BCR-ABL mutation. Notably, the improvement of splenomegaly by AIC-47 was remarkable and might be equal to or greater than that of TKI. These findings suggest that AIC-47 might be a promising agent for overcoming the resistance of Ph-positive leukemia to therapy.","['Shinohara, Haruka', 'Sugito, Nobuhiko', 'Kuranaga, Yuki', 'Heishima, Kazuki', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Shinohara H', 'Sugito N', 'Kuranaga Y', 'Heishima K', 'Minami Y', 'Naoe T', 'Akao Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8326-1203', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8902-5367']","['United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16J08131/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'JP18K15273/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (1-(azocan-1-yl)dec-3-en-1one)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fatty Acids/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",PMC6361563,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/02/12 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13913 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Feb;110(2):751-760. doi: 10.1111/cas.13913.

Imatinib as a relatively specific inhibitor of Bcr-Abl is at present one of the undisputed therapeutic agent for newlydiagnosed patients with CML. However, the occurrence of imatinib-resistance enlightens the urgent need to identify other therapeutic agents against CML. Juglone (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) exerts cytotoxic effects against various human cancer cell lines. However, the mechanisms through which Juglone induces anticancer effects in CML especially in comparison with imatinib treatment remain unknown. Our results revealed that Juglone-inhibited K562 cells growth through inducing apoptosis. Based on our Western blot analyses, Juglone significantly reduced p-Akt levels and increased the expression level of Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and FoxO3a proteins. Moreover, hairy/enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) protein, overexpressed under the influence of Juglone, is apparently involved in Juglone-induced apoptosis among K562 cells. Conversely, treatment with imatinib attenuated Hes1 protein expression. Considering the different functional mechanism of Juglone compared with imatinib, it seems that Juglone treatment could be a useful alternative strategy for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistance.","['Eskandari, Sedigheh', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Eskandari S', 'Yazdanparast R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4441-6975'],"['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'W6Q80SK9L6 (juglone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor HES-1/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2018/12/15 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28296 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Jun;120(6):10128-10136. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28296.

The objective of the current study was to describe how the 5-year cumulative incidence of NHL-specific and other-cause mortality varies by subtype, age, comorbidity level, and time since diagnosis in older patients. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry data linked to Medicare claims, patients aged >/=66 years were identified at the time of diagnosis with a first, primary NHL diagnosis from 2004 through 2013. Death certificate data and Fine-Gray competing risks models were used to estimate the 5-year cumulative incidence of NHL-specific and other-cause mortality by NHL subtype, age, and comorbidity level. Estimates were displayed over time using stacked cumulative incidence curves. RESULTS: Among 30,666 patients with NHL, 32% died of NHL and 13% died of other causes within 5 years of diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality increased with age and comorbidity level for all subtypes. Among patients with aggressive NHL subtypes, NHL-specific mortality exceeded other-cause mortality across all age groups, comorbidity levels, and number of years after diagnosis. For patients with indolent NHL subtypes, other-cause mortality was similar to or exceeded NHL-specific mortality, especially among older patients with severe comorbidity or with the indolent marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, and mycosis fungoides subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that mortality from causes other than NHL are important for patients of an older age, with a higher comorbidity level, and with indolent disease. Evidence from the current study can guide the development of tools for estimating individual prognosis that inform treatment discussions in patients with NHL.","['Hester, Laura L', 'Park, Steven I', 'Wood, William A', 'Sturmer, Til', 'Brookhart, M Alan', 'Lund, Jennifer L']","['Hester LL', 'Park SI', 'Wood WA', 'Sturmer T', 'Brookhart MA', 'Lund JL']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Titusville, New Jersey.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina.', 'Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma Program, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['R25 CA116339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001111/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/mortality', '*Cause of Death', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/mortality', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Mycosis Fungoides/mortality', 'SEER Program', 'Skin Neoplasms/mortality', 'United States', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/mortality']",PMC6719299,['NIHMS991902'],2018/12/15 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31821 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Apr 1;125(7):1101-1112. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31821.

MicroRNA (miRNA) have an important role in cancer initiation and progression due to their capacity to interfere with transcriptional signaling and regulate key cellular processes. miR-181a and miR-181b (miR-181a/b), which are located on chromosomes 1 and 9, are pathologically expressed in the tumor tissue and plasma of patients diagnosed with lung cancer. The miR-181a/b regulatory mechanisms are sophisticated and are directly related to different target genes. In recent years, an ever-increasing number of studies have focused on the biological relevance of miR-181a/b in key cellular processes. In this paper, we aim to discuss the challenging experimental data related to miR-181a/b and their potential use for the development of new therapeutic approaches in lung cancer. We will further present the ongoing issues regarding the regulation of their multiple target genes, and their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this deadly malignancy.","['Braicu, Cornelia', 'Gulei, Diana', 'Cojocneanu, Roxana', 'Raduly, Lajos', 'Jurj, Ancuta', 'Knutsen, Erik', 'Calin, George Adrian', 'Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana']","['Braicu C', 'Gulei D', 'Cojocneanu R', 'Raduly L', 'Jurj A', 'Knutsen E', 'Calin GA', 'Berindan-Neagoe I']",,"[""Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""MedFuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for RNA Inference and Non-Coding RNA, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""MedFuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, 'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""Department of Functional Genomics and Experimental Pathology, The Oncology Institute 'Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta', Cluj-Napoca, Romania.""]",['eng'],"['35/01.09.2016/POC Grant/International', '103375/MySMIS/International', 'UH3TR00943-01/National Institutes of Health (NIH/NCATS)/International', '1R01 CA182905-01/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA222007-01A1/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01GM122775-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096297/CA096300/U54/International', 'CA160445P1/UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research 2016 Pilot', 'Project, a Team DOD/International', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Moonshot Flagship project/International', 'Sister Institution Network Fund (SINF) 2017 Grant/International', 'Estate of C.

However, do these fusions occur or have a role in solid tumors? We performed extensive network analyses of MLL1-fusion partners in patient datasets, revealing that multiple MLL1-fusion partners exhibited significant interactions with the androgen-receptor signaling pathway. Further exploration of tumor sequence data from TCGA predicts the presence of MLL1 fusions with truncated SET domain in prostate tumors. To investigate the physiological relevance of MLL1 fusions in solid tumors, we engineered a truncated version of MLL1 by fusing it with one of its known fusion partners, ZC3H13, to use as a model system. Functional characterization with cell-based assays revealed that MLL1-ZC3H13 fusion induced chromosomal instability, affected mitotic progression, and enhanced tumorsphere formation. The MLL1-ZC3H13 chimera consistently increased the expression of a cancer stem cell marker (CD44); in addition, we detected potential collateral lethality between DOT1L and MLL1 fusions. Our work reveals that MLL1 fusions are likely prevalent in solid tumors and exhibit a potential pro-tumorigenic role.","['Parameswaran, Sreejit', 'Vizeacoumar, Frederick S', 'Kalyanasundaram Bhanumathy, Kalpana', 'Qin, Fujun', 'Islam, Md Fahmid', 'Toosi, Behzad M', 'Cunningham, Chelsea E', 'Mousseau, Darrell D', 'Uppalapati, Maruti C', 'Stirling, Peter C', 'Wu, Yuliang', 'Bonham, Keith', 'Freywald, Andrew', 'Li, Hui', 'Vizeacoumar, Franco J']","['Parameswaran S', 'Vizeacoumar FS', 'Kalyanasundaram Bhanumathy K', 'Qin F', 'Islam MF', 'Toosi BM', 'Cunningham CE', 'Mousseau DD', 'Uppalapati MC', 'Stirling PC', 'Wu Y', 'Bonham K', 'Freywald A', 'Li H', 'Vizeacoumar FJ']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Cell Signaling Laboratory, Departments of Psychiatry and Physiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Cancer Research, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cancer Cluster, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Cancer Research, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],"['CFI-33364/Canadian Foundation for Innovation/International', 'D2015-14/Movember Prostate Discovery Grant/International', 'Saskatchewan Cancer Agency/International', 'SHRF-3538/Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation/International', 'RGPIN-2014-04110/NSERC Discovery grantDiscovery Grant/International', 'Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (ZC3H13 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6360371,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12423 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2019 Feb;13(2):422-440. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12423.

To date, this has only occurred in one person after he received allogeneic stem cell transplants from a CCR5 32 homozygous donor in addition to chemotherapy and radiation to treat his acute myelocytic leukemia. The general consensus is that achieving a sustained remission of infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy will involve a combination of strategies that involve both the targeting of the latent proviral genome and the induction of more effective anti-HIV-1 immune responses. Efforts to reverse HIV-1 proviral DNA integration in the host cell genome and those to enhance anti-HIV immunity have been disappointing thus far. The lack of clinically validated assays to measure both effects has hampered the development of effective therapies. We suggest the consideration of genome editing as a new approach to reduce the latently integrated proviral genome. In addition, new approaches to therapeutic immunization, alterations of immunoregulatory pathways, anti-HIV-1 antibodies, and anti-HIV-1 chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocytes are in development.","['Jacobson, Jeffrey M', 'Khalili, Kamel']","['Jacobson JM', 'Khalili K']",,"['Department of Neuroscience, Center for Translational AIDS Research, Philadelphia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine.

However, due to the low capture efficiency and stochastic gene expression, scRNA-seq data often contains a high percentage of missing values. It has been showed that the missing rate can reach approximately 30% even after noise reduction. To accurately recover missing values in scRNA-seq data, we need to know where the missing data is; how much data is missing; and what are the values of these data. METHODS: To solve these three problems, we propose a novel model with a hybrid machine learning method, namely, missing imputation for single-cell RNA-seq (MISC). To solve the first problem, we transformed it to a binary classification problem on the RNA-seq expression matrix. Then, for the second problem, we searched for the intersection of the classification results, zero-inflated model and false negative model results. Finally, we used the regression model to recover the data in the missing elements. RESULTS: We compared the raw data without imputation, the mean-smooth neighbor cell trajectory, MISC on chronic myeloid leukemia data (CML), the primary somatosensory cortex and the hippocampal CA1 region of mouse brain cells. On the CML data, MISC discovered a trajectory branch from the CP-CML to the BC-CML, which provides direct evidence of evolution from CP to BC stem cells. On the mouse brain data, MISC clearly divides the pyramidal CA1 into different branches, and it is direct evidence of pyramidal CA1 in the subpopulations. In the meantime, with MISC, the oligodendrocyte cells became an independent group with an apparent boundary. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the MISC model improved the cell type classification and could be instrumental to study cellular heterogeneity. Overall, MISC is a robust missing data imputation model for single-cell RNA-seq data.","['Yang, Mary Qu', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Yang, William', 'Zhang, Jialing', 'Canaann, Allon', 'Guan, Renchu']","['Yang MQ', 'Weissman SM', 'Yang W', 'Zhang J', 'Canaann A', 'Guan R']",,"['Joint Bioinformatics Program, University of Arkansas Little Rock George Washington Donaghey College of Engineering & IT and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72204, USA. mqyang@ualr.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06512, USA. sherman.weissman@yale.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06512, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06512, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06512, USA.', 'Joint Bioinformatics Program, University of Arkansas Little Rock George Washington Donaghey College of Engineering & IT and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72204, USA. guanrenchu@jlu.edu.cn.', 'College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130012, China. guanrenchu@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['R15 GM114739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 DK101408/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods', '*Single-Cell Analysis']",PMC6293493,,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-018-0638-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-018-0638-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2018 Dec 14;12(Suppl 7):114. doi: 10.1186/s12918-018-0638-y.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*False negative curve', '*Missing data', '*Single-cell RNA-seq', '*Zero-inflated model']",,,20181214,['BMC Syst Biol. 2019 Jan 22;13(1):13.

However, activation of proto-oncogenes via insertional mutagenesis has resulted in the development of leukemia. We have utilized cellular bar coding to investigate the impact of different vector designs on the clonal behavior of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during in vivo expansion, as a quantitative surrogate assay for genotoxicity in a non-human primate model with high relevance for human biology. We transplanted two rhesus macaques with autologous CD34+ HSPCs transduced with three lentiviral vectors containing different promoters and/or enhancers of a predicted range of genotoxicities, each containing a high-diversity barcode library that uniquely tags each individual transduced HSPC. Analysis of clonal output from thousands of individual HSPCs transduced with these barcoded vectors revealed sustained clonal diversity, with no progressive dominance of clones containing any of the three vectors for up to almost 3 years post-transplantation. Our data support a low genotoxic risk for lentivirus vectors in HSPCs, even those containing strong promoters and/or enhancers. Additionally, this flexible system can be used for the testing of future vector designs.","['Yabe, Idalia M', 'Truitt, Lauren L', 'Espinoza, Diego A', 'Wu, Chuanfeng', 'Koelle, Samson', 'Panch, Sandhya', 'Corat, Marcus A F', 'Winkler, Thomas', 'Yu, Kyung-Rok', 'Hong, So Gun', 'Bonifacino, Aylin', 'Krouse, Allen', 'Metzger, Mark', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Yabe IM', 'Truitt LL', 'Espinoza DA', 'Wu C', 'Koelle S', 'Panch S', 'Corat MAF', 'Winkler T', 'Yu KR', 'Hong SG', 'Bonifacino A', 'Krouse A', 'Metzger M', 'Donahue RE', 'Dunbar CE']",,"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Multidisciplinary Center for Biological Research, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP 13083-877, Brazil.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

Apart from its suppressive activity, TGF-beta is a driving cytokine in the differentiation of induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) but also in the polarization of interleukin-9 (IL-9) producing T helper 9 (Th9) T cells. Human Vdelta2 expressing gammadelta T cells exert potent cytotoxicity towards a variety of solid tumor and leukemia/lymphoma target cells and thus are in the focus of current strategies to develop cell-based immunotherapies. Here we report that TGF-beta unexpectedly augments the cytotoxic effector activity of short-term expanded Vdelta2 T cells when purified gammadelta T cells are activated with specific pyrophosphate antigens and IL-2 or IL-15 in the presence of TGF-beta. TGF-beta up-regulates the expression of CD54, CD103, interferon-gamma, IL-9 and granzyme B in gammadelta T cells while CD56 and CD11a/CD18 are down-regulated. Moreover, we show that CD103 (alphaE/beta7 integrin) is recruited to the immunological synapse in gammadelta T cells. Increased cytotoxic activity of TGF-beta-exposed gammadelta T cells is reduced by anti-CD103 and further diminished upon additional anti-CD11a antibody treatment, pointing to a role of cellular adhesion in the enhanced cytolytic activity. Furthermore, magnetically sorted CD103-positive Vdelta2 T cells exhibit superior cytolytic activity. In view of the importance of CD103 for tissue homing of lymphocytes, our results suggest that adoptive transfer of CD103-expressing Vdelta2 T cells might favor their homing to solid tumors.","['Peters, Christian', 'Meyer, Annika', 'Kouakanou, Leonce', 'Feder, Julia', 'Schricker, Tim', 'Lettau, Marcus', 'Janssen, Ottmar', 'Wesch, Daniela', 'Kabelitz, Dieter']","['Peters C', 'Meyer A', 'Kouakanou L', 'Feder J', 'Schricker T', 'Lettau M', 'Janssen O', 'Wesch D', 'Kabelitz D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7669-3806', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1135-7879', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0410-0933', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3338-7489', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3824-9923', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9612-8900', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6509-208X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4160-7103']","['Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC6287804,,2018/12/14 06:00,2018/12/14 06:01,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1522471 [doi]', '1522471 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Sep 26;8(1):e1522471. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1522471. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD103', '*IFN-gamma', '*TGF-beta', '*Vdelta2', '*gamma/delta T cells']",,,20180926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, a selective and irreversible BTK inhibitor, has been efficacious in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphoma. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of ibrutinib alone and in selective adjuvant combinations against BL in-vitro and in a human BL xenografted immune-deficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mouse model. Our data demonstrated that phospho-BTK level was significantly reduced in BL cells treated with ibrutinib (p < 0.001). Moreover, we observed a significant decrease in cell proliferation as well as significant decrease in IC50 of ibrutinib in combination with dexamethasone, rituximab, obinutuzumab, carfilzomib, and doxorubicin (p < 0.001). In-vivo studies demonstrated ibrutinib treated mice had a significantly prolonged survival with median survival of mice following ibrutinib treatment (32 days) (24 days) (p < 0.02). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the significant in-vitro and preclinical in-vivo effects of ibrutinib in BL.

Because of these intimate interactions, we investigated the capacity of EC to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) and modulate CD8(+) T cell activation and proliferation in bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We found that EC from MM patients show a phenotype of semi-professional APC given that they express low levels of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, and of the inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOSL). In addition, they do not undergo the strong switch from immunoproteasome to standard proteasome subunit expression which is typical of mature professional APC such as dendritic cells. EC can trap and present antigen to CD8(+) T cells, stimulating a central memory CD8(+) T cell population that expresses Foxp3 and produces high amounts of IL-10 and TGF-beta. Another CD8(+) T cell population is stimulated by professional APC, produces IFN-gamma, and exerts antitumor activity. Thus, two distinct CD8(+) T cell populations coexist in the bone marrow of MM patients: the first population is sustained by EC, expresses Foxp3, produces IL-10 and TGF-beta, and exerts pro-tumor activity by negatively regulating the second population. This study adds new insight into the role that EC play in MM biology and describes an additional immune regulatory mechanism that inhibits the development of antitumor immunity and may impair the success of cancer immunotherapy.","['Leone, Patrizia', 'Di Lernia, Giuseppe', 'Solimando, Antonio Giovanni', 'Cicco, Sebastiano', 'Saltarella, Ilaria', 'Lamanuzzi, Aurelia', 'Ria, Roberto', 'Frassanito, Maria Antonia', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Ditonno, Paolo', 'Dammacco, Franco', 'Racanelli, Vito', 'Vacca, Angelo']","['Leone P', 'Di Lernia G', 'Solimando AG', 'Cicco S', 'Saltarella I', 'Lamanuzzi A', 'Ria R', 'Frassanito MA', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ditonno P', 'Dammacco F', 'Racanelli V', 'Vacca A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0904-1074', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8639-1940']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit & Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, IRCCS ""Giovanni Paolo II"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Unit of Internal Medicine ""Guido Baccelli"", University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC6287798,,2018/12/14 06:00,2018/12/14 06:01,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1486949 [doi]', '1486949 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Oct 22;8(1):e1486949. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1486949. eCollection 2019.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*CD8 T cells', '*MGUS', '*endothelial cells', '*multiple myeloma', '*plasma cells', '*tumor immune evasion']",,,20181022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, mutations of RAS type GTPase family genes have been identified in 10-15% patients with MDS. The authors' previous study on the gene expression profile of cluster of differentiation 34(+) cells using microarray analysis identified elevated expression of RAP1GTPase activating protein 1 (Rap1GAP) in patients with MDS compared with that in non-malignant blood diseases (NM) control group. To further investigate the mechanism of increased Rap1GAP expression, the methylation pattern of the promoter of this gene was determined in 86 patients with MDS (n=29), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=31) or NM (n=26) using bisulfite-specific polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. The results demonstrated that the methylation of Rap1GAP occurred in all 29 patients with MDS at multiple CpG sites. The methylation level of Rap1GAP in patients with MDS was decreased compared with that in patients with NM. Significant differences at 4CpG sites (5,7,8 and 12) of Rap1GAP promoter were identified between MDS and NM. Furthermore, based on the present clinical records of the patient cohort, the methylation status of Rap1GAP promoter did not appear to be associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with MDS, including age, gender and International Prognosis Score System. The difference in methylation level at CpG site 8 of Rap1GAP promoter was identified to be significantly increased in patients with MDS-refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts compared with that in the MDS-refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia or MDS-unclassified groups. The results of the present study suggest that patients with MDS exhibit a lower overall methylation level within Rap1GAP promoter compared with patients with NM or AML. In addition, the methylation level at the four identified CpG sites can distinguish between MDS and NM.","['Ding, Wen-Jing', 'Yang, Yi', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Wang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Dong, Wan-Li', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Qi, Xiao-Fei', 'Jiang, Feng', 'Chen, Su-Ning']","['Ding WJ', 'Yang Y', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang YY', 'Dong WL', 'Cen JN', 'Qi XF', 'Jiang F', 'Chen SN']",,"['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.

In the present study, clinical characteristics and experimental observations in 9 adult patients diagnosed with AMKL, who were recruited by the Sino-U.S. Shanghai Leukemia Co-operative Group, were analyzed in order to summarize the diagnostic experience and provide recommendations on diagnosing AMKL. All the patients were diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Organization diagnostic criteria. The mean age of the patients with AMKL was 59 years (range, 53-68 years). A total of 8 patients had different degrees of anemia, and 2 patients had <5% marrow blasts present in the bone marrow; however, the percentage of positive cells with cluster of differentiation (CD)41 and CD61 expression was >20%, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. A total of 6 patients were positive for platelet-specific antigens, as indicated by immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, 7 patients presented with moderate or marked MF, as demonstrated by a bone marrow biopsy. Karyotypic analysis indicated that 6 patients had abnormal karyotypes. Only 1 patient exhibited the Janus kinase 2V617F mutation. Treatment efficiency was notably poor, with a median survival time of 6.0 months (range, 1.1-24.0 months). In conclusion, the diagnosis of AMKL requires a combination of the results of bone marrow smears and bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotype or immunohistochemistry. We recommend that routine immunophenotypic analysis should include the CD41 and CD61 markers for diagnosing acute leukemia when bone marrow morphology does not indicate the diagnosis.","['Zhao, Guangjie', 'Wu, Wanling', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Gu, Jingwen']","['Zhao G', 'Wu W', 'Wang X', 'Gu J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, P.R.

An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying beta cell mass and failure will be useful for identifying novel approaches toward preventing and treating this disease. Recent studies have indicated that free fatty acids (FFAs) can cause beta cell dysfunction. In the present study, palmitate (Pal) was used as a FFA and its functions on cell viability and apoptosis were detected. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used and the results revealed that incubation of INS-1 cells with Pal significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis. However, a co-incubation with thrombospondin 1 (THBS-1) protected the cells against Pal-induced toxicity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in fatty acid-induced beta cell dysfunction. Various studies have reported that miR-182-5p is associated with a number of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and leukemia. However, to the best of our knowledge miR-182-5p has never been reported to be associated with diabetes. In the present study, miR-182-5p, which is predicted to target the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of THBS-1, was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in INS-1 cells in response to Pal. miR-182-5p was significantly increased in Pal-treated cells compared with the control cells. Furthermore, miR-182-5p mimics significantly decreased cell viability and increased Pal-induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells. However, cell viability was increased and Pal-induced apoptosis was decreased in cells that were treated with miR-182-5p inhibitors. The present findings also revealed that overexpression of THBS-1 counteracted the effect of miR-182-5p on cell viability and apoptosis. These results suggested that miR-182-5p is involved in the mechanism of THBS 1 on the modulation of beta cell survival.","['Liu, Ying', 'Dong, Jiayue', 'Ren, Bo']","['Liu Y', 'Dong J', 'Ren B']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R.

The perception that bone marrow adipocytes are ""inert space fillers"" has been broken, and currently, bone marrow fat is unanimously considered to be the third largest fat depot, after subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. Bone marrow fat (BMF) acts as a metabolically active organ and plays an active role in energy storage, endocrine function, bone metabolism, and the bone metastasis of tumors. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs), as a component of the bone marrow microenvironment, influence hematopoiesis through direct contact with cells and the secretion of adipocyte-derived factors. They also influence the progression of hematologic diseases such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia, and may be a novel target when exploring treatments for related diseases in the future.

We here characterize the curative potential of BH3-mimetics differentially targeting mitochondrial BCL2-family members using a combination therapy approach with dexamethasone and tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL. In BCR-ABL + ALL BH3-mimetics act by redistribution of mitochondrial activator BIM, which is strongly required for cytotoxicity of the BCL2-specific BH3-mimetic ABT-199, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and dexamethasone. BIM expression is enhanced by dexamethasone and TKIs and both synergize with ABT-199 in BCR-ABL + ALL. Triple combinations with ABT-199, dexamethasone and TKIs efficiently attenuate leukemia progression both in tissue culture and in primary cell xenotransplantation models. Notably, the dasatinib-containing combination led to treatment- and leukemia-free long-term survival in a BCR-ABL + mouse model. Finally, response to BH3-mimetics can be predicted for individual patients in a clinically relevant setting. These data demonstrate curative targeted and chemotherapy-free pharmacotherapy for BCR-ABL + ALL in a preclinical model.

Their expression is therefore under tight epigenetic control. We previously reported in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) that a member of the THE1B class of LTR elements acted as a promoter for the proto-oncogene and growth factor receptor gene CSF1R and that expression of this gene is required for cHL tumour survival. However, to which extent and how such elements participate in globally shaping the unique cHL gene expression programme is unknown. To address this question we mapped the genome-wide activation of THE1-LTRs in cHL cells using a targeted next generation sequencing approach (RACE-Seq). Integration of these data with global gene expression data from cHL and control B cell lines showed a unique pattern of LTR activation impacting on gene expression, including genes associated with the cHL phenotype. We also show that global LTR activation is induced by strong inflammatory stimuli. Together these results demonstrate that LTR activation provides an additional layer of gene deregulation in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and highlight the potential impact of genome-wide LTR activation in other inflammatory diseases.","['Edginton-White, Benjamin', 'Cauchy, Pierre', 'Assi, Salam A', 'Hartmann, Sylvia', 'Riggs, Arthur G', 'Mathas, Stephan', 'Cockerill, Peter N', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Edginton-White B', 'Cauchy P', 'Assi SA', 'Hartmann S', 'Riggs AG', 'Mathas S', 'Cockerill PN', 'Bonifer C']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6557-676X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0659-0799', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4410-8174', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4267-0825']","['Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham, B152TT, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham, B152TT, UK.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics, 79108, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham, B152TT, UK.', 'Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University Hospital, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 12200, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham, B152TT, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham, B152TT, UK. c.bonifer@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['15001/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genome, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6558280,['EMS80347'],2018/12/14 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0311-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0311-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1463-1474. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0311-x.

However, the role of EBV in NKTCL development is unclear, largely due to the lack of information about EBV genome and transcriptome in NKTCL. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we obtained whole genome (n = 27) and transcriptome datasets (n = 18) of EBV derived from NKTCL tumor biopsies. We assembled 27 EBV genomes and detected an average of 1,152 single nucleotide variants and 44.8 indels (<50 bp) of EBV per sample. We also identified frequent focal EBV genome deletions and integrated EBV fragments in the host genome. Moreover, Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NKTCL-derived EBVs are closely clustered; transcriptome analysis revealed less activation of both latent and lytic genes and larger amount of T-cell epitope alterations in NKTCL, as compared with other EBV-associated cancers. Furthermore, we observed transcriptional defects of the BARTs miRNA by deletion, and the disruption of host NHEJ1 by integrated EBV fragment, implying novel pathogenic mechanisms of EBV. Taken together, we reported for the first time global mutational and transcriptional profiles of EBV in NKTCL clinical samples, revealing important somatic events of EBV and providing insights to better understanding of EBV's contribution in tumorigenesis.","['Peng, Rou-Jun', 'Han, Bo-Wei', 'Cai, Qing-Qing', 'Zuo, Xiao-Yu', 'Xia, Tao', 'Chen, Jie-Rong', 'Feng, Li-Na', 'Lim, Jing Quan', 'Chen,

When used in conjunction with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, allo-HCT from an HLA haplo-identical donor yields promising outcomes for many diseases other than ATL. However, appropriate comparisons with other donor sources, especially cord blood and conventional HLA haplo-identical donors, are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of this modality. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of allo-HCT without PTCY in patients with ATL registered in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation TRUMP database between 1985 and 2015. During that period, 46 patients received allo-HCT without PTCY and survivors were followed for a median of 2316.5 days (range: 220-3884 days). Although the estimated 1- and 5-year overall survival rates of the entire cohort were 34.5% and 17.7%, respectively, the cumulative 1- and 5-year non-ATL mortality rates of 41.3% and 55.8%, respectively, were high.

The application of next-generation sequencing technologies, especially transcriptome sequencing, has resulted in the identification of novel molecular subtypes of ALL with prognostic and therapeutic implications, as well as cooperative mutations that account for much of the heterogeneity in clinical responses observed among patients with specific ALL subtypes. In addition, germline genetic variants have been shown to influence the risk of developing ALL and/or the responses of non-malignant and leukaemia cells to therapy; shared pathways for drug activation and metabolism are implicated in treatment-related toxicity and drug sensitivity or resistance, depending on whether the genetic changes are germline, somatic or both. Indeed, although once considered a non-hereditary disease, genomic investigations of familial and sporadic ALL have revealed a growing number of genetic alterations or conditions that predispose individuals to the development of ALL and treatment-related second cancers. The identification of these genetic alterations holds the potential to direct genetic counselling, testing and possibly monitoring for the early detection of ALL and other cancers. Herein, we review these advances in our understanding of the genomic landscape of childhood ALL and their clinical implications.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Pui CH', 'Nichols KE', 'Yang JJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0303-5658', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-9659']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.

The primary goals of treatment for MPNs are to reduce the risk of thrombosis, alleviate systemic symptom burden (eg, fatigue, pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly), and to prevent transformation to MF/AML. Preventing transformation is clearly important, but not expected with current therapies. Currently, cytoreduction is advised based on vascular risk assessments, which include age and thrombosis history, as well as molecular profile in ET. Traditionally, cytoreduction has been advised only in patients with high vascular risk. Recently, a large prospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cytoreduction in patients with ET with less-than-high-risk vascular profiles. A larger question in the MPN field is whether cytoreduction is advisable for all patients with ET and PV, regardless of risk.

Multiple aspects of platelet function are impaired in these patients, associated with altered expression of genes regulated by RUNX1 We aimed to identify RUNX1-targets involved in platelet function by combining transcriptome analysis of patient and shRUNX1-transduced megakaryocytes (MK). Down-regulated genes included TREM-like transcript (TLT)-1 (TREML1) and the integrin subunit alpha (alpha)-2 (ITGA2) of collagen receptor alpha2-beta (beta)-1, which are involved in platelet aggregation and adhesion, respectively. RUNX1 binding to regions enriched for H3K27Ac marks was demonstrated for both genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cloning of these regions upstream of the respective promoters in lentivirus allowing mCherry reporter expression showed that RUNX1 positively regulates TREML1 and ITGA2, and this regulation was abrogated after deletion of RUNX1 sites. TLT-1 content was reduced in patient MK and platelets. A blocking anti-TLT-1 antibody was able to block aggregation of normal but not patient platelets, whereas recombinant soluble TLT-1 potentiated fibrinogen binding to patient platelets, pointing to a role for TLT-1 deficiency in the platelet function defect. Low levels of alpha2 integrin subunit were demonstrated in patient platelets and MK, coupled with reduced platelet and MK adhesion to collagen, both under static and flow conditions. In conclusion, we show that gene expression profiling of RUNX1 knock-down or mutated MK provides a suitable approach to identify novel RUNX1 targets, among which downregulation of TREML1 and ITGA2 clearly contribute to the platelet phenotype of familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML.","['Glembotsky, Ana C', 'Sliwa, Dominika', 'Bluteau, Dominique', 'Balayn, Nathalie', 'Marin Oyarzun, Cecilia P', 'Raimbault, Anna', 'Bordas, Marie', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Pirozhkova, Iryna', 'Washington, Valance', 'Goette, Nora P', 'Marta, Rosana F', 'Favier, Remi', 'Raslova, Hana', 'Heller, Paula G']","['Glembotsky AC', 'Sliwa D', 'Bluteau D', 'Balayn N', 'Marin Oyarzun CP', 'Raimbault A', 'Bordas M', 'Droin N', 'Pirozhkova I', 'Washington V', 'Goette NP', 'Marta RF', 'Favier R', 'Raslova H', 'Heller PG']",,"['Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'Hematologia Investigacion, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas (IDIM), Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE), Paris, France', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'Hematologia Investigacion, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas (IDIM), Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Genomic Platform UMS AMMICA, Villejuif, France', 'CNRS UMR 8126, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France', 'Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico and', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'Hematologia Investigacion, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas (IDIM), Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Trousseau, CRPP, Services d'Hematologie Biologique et Clinique, Paris, France"", 'INSERM UMR 1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, Franc', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina', 'Hematologia Investigacion, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas (IDIM), Buenos Aires, Argentina']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ITGA2B protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha2)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TREML1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/blood/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics']",PMC6545826,,2018/12/14 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.188904 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.188904 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jun;104(6):1244-1255. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.188904.

However, subsets of patients can be identified who remain at very high risk of relapse with expected 4-year disease-free survival rates <80%; such patients are appropriate candidates for intensive therapeutic strategies designed to improve survival. The AALL1131 trial was designed to determine, in a randomized fashion, whether substitution with cyclophosphamide/etoposide (experimental arm 1) would improve the 4-year disease-free survival of children, adolescents, and young adults with very high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to a modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster regimen (control arm). Patients 1-30 years of age with newly diagnosed very high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomized after induction in a 1:2 fashion to the control arm or experimental arm 1 in which they were given cyclophosphamide (440 mg/m(2) days 1-5)/etoposide (100 mg/m(2) days 1-5) during part 2 of consolidation and delayed intensification. Prospective interim monitoring rules for efficacy and futility were included where futility would be determined for a one-sided P-value >/=0.7664. The study was stopped for futility as the interim monitoring boundary was crossed [hazard ratio 0.606 (95% confidence interval: 0.297 - 1.237)] and the very high-risk arm of AALL1131 was closed in February 2017.

There were no significant differences in grade 3/4 adverse events between the two arms. Substitution of this therapy for very high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients on the Children's Oncology Group AALL1131 trial (NCT02883049) randomized to cyclophosphamide/etoposide during part 2 of consolidation and delayed intensification did not improve disease-free survival.","['Burke, Michael J', 'Salzer, Wanda L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Gore, Lia', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Carroll, William L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Burke MJ', 'Salzer WL', 'Devidas M', 'Dai Y', 'Gore L', 'Hilden JM', 'Larsen E', 'Rabin KR', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood B', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Winick N', 'Carroll WL', 'Raetz EA', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI mmburke@mcw.edu."", 'U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, MD.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado and The University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado and The University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at San Francisco, CA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC6518909,,2018/12/14 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.204545 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.204545 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 May;104(5):986-992. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.204545.

Response to these agents occurs in approximately 50% of treated patients, and duration of response, although variable, is transient. Prediction of response to HMAs is possible with clinical and molecular parameters, but alternative approved treatments are not available, and in the case of HMA failure, there are no standard therapeutic opportunities. It is important to develop a reasoned choice of therapy after HMA failure. This choice should be based on evaluation of type of resistance (primary vs secondary, progression of disease [acute leukemia or higher risk MDS] vs absence of hematological improvement) as well as on molecular and cytogenetic characteristics reassessed at the moment of HMA failure. Rescue strategies may include stem-cell transplantation, which remains the only curative option, and chemotherapy, both of which are feasible in only a minority of cases, and experimental agents. Patients experiencing HMA failure should be recruited to clinical experimental trials as often as possible. Several novel agents with different mechanisms of action are currently being tested in this setting. Drugs targeting molecular alterations (IDH2 mutations, spliceosome gene mutations) or altered signaling pathways (BCL2 inhibitors) seem to be the most promising.","['Santini, Valeria']",['Santini V'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-5439-2172'],"['MDS Unit, Hematology, AOU Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy; and Fondazione Italiana Sindromi Mielodisplastiche (FISMonlus), Alessandria, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/10/19 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42809-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-03-785915 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Feb 7;133(6):521-529. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-03-785915.

Genetic, malignant or inflammatory underlying diseases as well as insertion of venous catheters can be responsible for this pathology. Due to its rare occurrence, it is difficult to find systematic research about thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of present patient data from our ENT department with the electronic patient record considering the period from 2012-2017. Search terms were ""thrombosis"" and ""jugular internal vein"". We identified 41 patients with the requested diagnosis and performed further analysis of the cases. Internal jugular vein thrombosis was diagnosed in all patients using Duplex sonography and/or CT/MR angiography. RESULTS: Paraneoplastic thrombosis was found in 22/41 patients (54%), in 15 of the 22 (68%), the tumor was located in the ENT region. Two out of seven (29%) of the patients with tumor entities outside the head and neck region had thrombosis of the internal jugular vein as the first symptom of the disease. Another 14/41 patients (34%) had underlying inflammatory diseases - mostly streptococci-associated - for example a cervical abscess. In two patients, insertion of a central-venous catheter was causal, in three patients we could not find any reason for the development of thrombosis. CONCLUSION: To diagnose the rare and often asymptomatic thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, ultrasound of the cervical region should always include vascular imaging. Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein results mostly paraneoplastic or due to inflammation/abscess.

Single-arm studies have suggested that a 10-day schedule of decitabine cycles leads to better outcomes than the usual 5-day schedule. We compared the efficacy and safety of these two schedules. METHODS: Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia but unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy (or <60 years if unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy with an anthracycline plus cytarabine). The first 40 patients were allocated equally to the two treatment groups by computer-generated block randomisation (block size 40), after which a response-adaptive randomisation algorithm used all previous patients' treatment and response data to decide the allocation of each following patient favouring the group with superior response. Patients were assigned to receive 20 mg/m(2) decitabine intravenously for 5 or 10 consecutive days as induction therapy, every 4-8 weeks for up to three cycles. Responding patients received decitabine as consolidation therapy on a 5-day schedule for up to 24 cycles. We assessed a composite primary endpoint of complete remission, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), and complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) achieved at any time and assessed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786343. FINDINGS: Between Feb 28, 2013, and April 12, 2018, 71 patients were enrolled. 28 received decitabine for 5 days and 43 for 10 days, and all were assessable for efficacy and safety. The primary endpoint was achieved in similar proportions of patients in the two treatment groups (12 [43%] of 28 in the 5-day schedule group, 95% credible interval 26-60, and 17 [40%] of 43 in the 10-day schedule group, 26-54, p=0.78; difference 3%, -21 to 27). Total follow-up was 38.2 months, during which the median duration of overall survival was 5.5 months (IQR 2.1-11.7) in the 5-day group and 6.0 months (1.9-11.7) in the 10-day group. 1-year overall survival was 25% in both groups. Complete remission, CRp, CRi, and overall survival did not differ between groups when stratified by cytogenetics, de-novo versus secondary or therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia, or TP53(mut) status. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenic fever (seven patients [25%] in the 5-day group and 14 [33%] in the 10-day group) and infection (five [18%] and 16 [37%], respectively). One patient (4%) died from sepsis in the context of neutropenic fever, infection, and haemorrhage in the 5-day group, and in the 10-day group six patients (14%) died from infection. Early mortality was similar in the two groups. INTERPRETATION: In older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia, efficacy and safety did not differ by the 5-day or the 10-day decitabine schedule.

In addition, a potential effect of such variant on the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) has been reported. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the impact of the C677T variant of MTHFR on MTX-related toxicity in ALL patients from Tunisia; to provide new insights for a personalized therapy based on the human genotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotyping was carried out with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on blood samples from a total of 35 younger patients; suffering from ALL. RESULTS: In the ALL patients, the MTHFR 677CT genotype confers a greater risk of toxicity with 1.3 times as relative risk mainly the hepatic toxicity when compared with MTHFR 677CC. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that C677T polymorphism of MTHFR seems to be a good marker for MTX-related toxicity in ALL.","['Frikha, Rim', 'Rebai, Tarek', 'Lobna, Ben Mahmoud', 'Frikha, Fakher', 'Mdhaffar, Moez', 'Frikha, Imen', 'Elloumi, Moez', 'Bouayed, Nouha']","['Frikha R', 'Rebai T', 'Lobna BM', 'Frikha F', 'Mdhaffar M', 'Frikha I', 'Elloumi M', 'Bouayed N']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4415-8785'],"['1 Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, Laboratory of Histology, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, Laboratory of Histology, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '2 Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, Laboratory of Pharmacology, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '3 Faculty of Sciences of Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '4 Department of Haematology, Hedi Chaker Hospital, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '4 Department of Haematology, Hedi Chaker Hospital, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '4 Department of Haematology, Hedi Chaker Hospital, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, Laboratory of Histology, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155218818244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Jul;25(5):1182-1186. doi: 10.1177/1078155218818244.

Unfortunately, a significant fraction of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) relapses mainly because of gene amplification, mutations, or other bypass mechanisms. Recently a growing number of papers showed how, in some cases, resistance due to oncogene overexpression may be associated with drug addiction: cells able to proliferate in the presence of high TKI doses become also TKI dependent, undergoing cellular stress, and apoptosis/death upon drug withdrawal. Notably, if a sub-cellular population survives TKI discontinuation it is also partially re-sensitized to the same drug. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients relapsing upon TKI treatment may benefit from a discontinuous therapeutic schedule. We focused on two different hematologic malignancies, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), both successfully treatable with TKIs. The two models utilized (LAMA and SUP-M2) differed in having oncogene overexpression as the sole cause of drug resistance (CML), or additionally carrying kinase domain mutations (ALCL). In both cases drug withdrawal caused a sudden overload of oncogenic signal, enhanced mitochondria activity, induced the release of a high amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused genotoxic stress and massive cell death. In LAMA cells (CML) we could rescue the cells from death by partially blocking downstream oncogenic signaling or lowering ROS detrimental effect by adding reduced glutathione.","['Ceccon, Monica', 'Mauri, Mario', 'Massimino, Luca', 'Giudici, Giovanni', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Mologni, Luca']","['Ceccon M', 'Mauri M', 'Massimino L', 'Giudici G', 'Piazza R', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Mologni L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6772-1791', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5876-6215', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3975-9148']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20900 Monza, Italy. monica.ceccon@unimib.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20900 Monza, Italy. mario.mauri@unimib.it.', 'Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milano, Italy. luca.massimino@unimib.it.', 'Tettamanti Research Centre, Pediatric Clinic, c/o Nuovo Osp.San Gerardo, 20900 Monza, Italy. g.giudici@asst-monza.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20900 Monza, Italy. rocco.piazza@unimib.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20900 Monza, Italy. carlo.gambacorti@unimib.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20900 Monza, Italy. luca.mologni@unimib.it.']",['eng'],"['16669/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'IG-17727/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6316814,,2018/12/14 06:00,2018/12/14 06:01,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10120509 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10120509 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 Dec 12;10(12). pii: cancers10120509. doi: 10.3390/cancers10120509.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'inhibitors', 'oncogene', 'personalized medicine', 'targeted therapy']",,,20181212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutated in about 1/3 of de novo AML, the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase is an attractive target for drug development, activating mutations of the FLT3 map to the juxtamembrane domain (internal tandem duplications, ITD) or the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), most frequently at codon D835. While small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) effectively target ITD mutant forms, those on the TKD are not responsive. Moreover, FLT3 inhibition fails to induce a persistent response in patients due to mutational resistance. More potent compounds with broader inhibitory effects on multiple FLT3 mutations are highly desirable. We describe a critical role of CDK6 in the survival of FLT3(+) AML cells as palbociclib induced apoptosis not only in FLT3(-)ITD(+) cells but also in FLT3(-)D835Y(+) cells. Antineoplastic effects were also seen in primary patient-derived cells and in a xenograft model, where therapy effectively suppressed tumor formation in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations. In cells with FLT3(-)ITD or -TKD mutations, the CDK6 protein not only affects cell cycle progression but also transcriptionally regulates oncogenic kinases mediating intrinsic drug resistance, including AURORA and AKT-a feature not shared by its homolog CDK4. While AKT and AURORA kinase inhibitors have significant therapeutic potential in AML, single agent activity has not been proven overly effective. We describe synergistic combination effects when applying these drugs together with palbociclib which could be readily translated to patients with AML bearing FLT3(-)ITD or (-)TKD mutations. Targeting synergistically acting vulnerabilities, with CDK6 being the common denominator, may represent a promising strategy to improve AML patient responses and to reduce the incidence of selection of resistance-inducing mutations.","['Uras, Iris Z', 'Maurer, Barbara', 'Nebenfuehr, Sofie', 'Zojer, Markus', 'Valent, Peter', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Uras IZ', 'Maurer B', 'Nebenfuehr S', 'Zojer M', 'Valent P', 'Sexl V']",,"['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, 1210 Vienna, Austria. iris.uras@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, 1210 Vienna, Austria. barbara.maurer@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, 1210 Vienna, Austria. sofie.nebenfuehr@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, 1210 Vienna, Austria. markus.zojer@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, 1210 Vienna, Austria. veronika.sexl@vetmeduni.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['694354/H2020 European Research Council', 'F4701, F4704, F4706/Austrian Science Fund']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Aurora Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6321303,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19123987 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19123987 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Dec 11;19(12). pii: ijms19123987. doi: 10.3390/ijms19123987.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'AML', 'AURORA kinases', 'CDK6', 'FLT3-D835Y', 'FLT3-ITD', 'palbociclib']",,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono- and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host. Our study supports the utility of cats naturally co-infected with retroviruses as a model to investigate the impact of FV on immunocompromised mammalian hosts.","['Cavalcante, Liliane T F', 'Muniz, Claudia P', 'Jia, Hongwei', 'Augusto, Anderson M', 'Troccoli, Fernando', 'Medeiros, Sheila de O', 'Dias, Carlos G A', 'Switzer, William M', 'Soares, Marcelo A', 'Santos, Andre F']","['Cavalcante LTF', 'Muniz CP', 'Jia H', 'Augusto AM', 'Troccoli F', 'Medeiros SO', 'Dias CGA', 'Switzer WM', 'Soares MA', 'Santos AF']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4591-8731', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9013-2570']","['Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil. liliane.tavaresdefaria@gmail.com.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil. claudia.muniz16@gmail.com.', 'Programa de Oncovirologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil. claudia.muniz16@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329-4027, USA. hjia@cdc.gov.', 'Fundacao Rio-Zoo, Parque da Quinta da Boa Vista, S/N, Rio de Janeiro 20940-040, Brazil. andersonriozoo@gmail.com.', 'Fundacao Rio-Zoo, Parque da Quinta da Boa Vista, S/N, Rio de Janeiro 20940-040, Brazil. fernando.troccoli@riozoo.com.br.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil. sheila.omedeiros@gmail.com.', 'CAT (Centro de Atendimento e Terapia) para Gatos, Rua Mariz e Barros, 292, Rio de Janeiro 20270-001, Brazil. cgabrielvet@hotmail.com.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329-4027, USA. bis3@cdc.gov.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil. masoares@biologia.ufrj.br.', 'Programa de Oncovirologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil. masoares@biologia.ufrj.br.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil. andre20@globo.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brazil', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Coinfection/*veterinary/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Male', 'Proviruses', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/*veterinary', '*Spumavirus', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/*veterinary', 'Viral Load/veterinary', 'Virus Replication']",PMC6315984,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['v10120702 [pii]', '10.3390/v10120702 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2018 Dec 11;10(12). pii: v10120702. doi: 10.3390/v10120702.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*feline illness', '*neglected virus', '*proviral load', '*spumavirus']",,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This HAC vector was designed to deliver copies of genes into patients with genetic diseases caused by the loss of a particular gene function. The alphoid(tetO)-HAC vector has been successfully transferred into murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and maintained stably as an independent chromosome during the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Human ESCs and iPSCs have significant differences in culturing conditions and pluripotency state in comparison with the murine naive-type ESCs and iPSCs. To date, transferring alphoid(tetO)-HAC vector into human iPSCs (hiPSCs) remains a challenging task. In this study, we performed the microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) of alphoid(tetO)-HAC expressing the green fluorescent protein into newly generated hiPSCs. We used a recently modified MMCT method that employs an envelope protein of amphotropic murine leukemia virus as a targeting cell fusion agent. Our data provide evidence that a totally artificial vector, alphoid(tetO)-HAC, can be transferred and maintained in human iPSCs as an independent autonomous chromosome without affecting pluripotent properties of the cells. These data also open new perspectives for implementing alphoid(tetO)-HAC as a gene therapy tool in future biomedical applications.","['Sinenko, Sergey A', 'Skvortsova, Elena V', 'Liskovykh, Mikhail A', 'Ponomartsev, Sergey V', 'Kuzmin, Andrey A', 'Khudiakov, Aleksandr A', 'Malashicheva, Anna B', 'Alenina, Natalia', 'Larionov, Vladimir', 'Kouprina, Natalay', 'Tomilin, Alexey N']","['Sinenko SA', 'Skvortsova EV', 'Liskovykh MA', 'Ponomartsev SV', 'Kuzmin AA', 'Khudiakov AA', 'Malashicheva AB', 'Alenina N', 'Larionov V', 'Kouprina N', 'Tomilin AN']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5517-8218', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9214-0868', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0820-2913', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1137-7167']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., St-Petersburg 194064, Russia. s.sinenko@incras.ru.', 'Division of Molecular and Radiation Biophysics, Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute named by B.P.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces the unfolded protein response comprising a highly conserved set of genes crucial for cell survival; among these is Ire1, whose auto-phosphorylation drives it to acquire a regulated mRNA decay activity. The mRNA-modifying function of phosphorylated Ire1 non-canonically splices Xbp1 mRNA and yet degrades other cellular mRNAs with related motifs. Naive splenic B cells will activate Ire1 phosphorylation early on after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, within 18 h; large-scale changes in mRNA content and splicing patterns result. Inhibition of the mRNA-degradation function of Ire1 is correlated with further differences in the splicing patterns and a reduction in the mRNA factors for snRNA transcription. Some of the >4000 splicing changes seen at 18 h after LPS stimulation persist into the late stages of antibody secretion, up to 72 h. Meanwhile some early splicing changes are supplanted by new splicing changes introduced by the up-regulation of ELL2, a transcription elongation factor. ELL2 is necessary for immunoglobulin secretion and does this by changing mRNA processing patterns of immunoglobulin heavy chain and >5000 other genes.","['Carew, Nolan T', 'Nelson, Ashley M', 'Liang, Zhitao', 'Smith, Sage M', 'Milcarek, Christine']","['Carew NT', 'Nelson AM', 'Liang Z', 'Smith SM', 'Milcarek C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6995-6823'],"['School of Medicine, Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, E1059 Biomedical Science Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. ntc8@pitt.edu.', 'School of Medicine, Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, E1059 Biomedical Science Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. amd257@pitt.edu.', 'School of Medicine, Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, E1059 Biomedical Science Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.

The different macromolecular characteristics of SP were determined by size exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light-scattering detection (SEC-MALLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H NMR and (13)C NMR). The native molecular weight of the extracted polysaccharide is high (>/=336,900g.mol(-1)). It showed high amounts of sulfated groups (28.2%) and low levels of proteins. It was found to be a potent inducer of apoptosis on acute monocytic leukaemia THP-1cell lines with EC50 value of 53mug.mL(-1). Furthermore, a significant gastroprotective effect (p<0.01) was also observed with a gastric ulcer inhibition of 63.44%, 78.42% and 82.15% at the doses 25, 50 and 100mg.kg(-1), respectively. In addition, SP significantly increased glutathione levels (GSH) and decreased the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in EtOH/HCl-damaged gastric mucosa in rats; it also exhibited an important antioxidant activity in vitro. Therefore, SP, derived from the red alga Laurencia obtusa, may have a potential therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and a beneficial potential as gastroprotective and antioxidant natural product.","['Lajili, Sirine', 'Ammar, Hiba Hadj', 'Mzoughi, Zeineb', 'Amor, Haifa Bel Haj', 'Muller, Christian D', 'Majdoub, Hatem', 'Bouraoui, Abderrahman']","['Lajili S', 'Ammar HH', 'Mzoughi Z', 'Amor HBH', 'Muller CD', 'Majdoub H', 'Bouraoui A']",,"['Laboratoire de Developpement Chimique, Galenique et Pharmacologique des Medicaments (LR12ES09), Unite de Pharmacologie Marine, Faculte de Pharmacie de Monastir, Universite de Monastir, 5000 Monastir, Tunisia; Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, UMR 7178 CNRS, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Strasbourg, 74 route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.

There was no history of hematologic disease. The diameter of the testicular mass was 40 mm. We performed a left orchiectomy. Histopathologic examination revealed diffuse infiltration of immature neoplastic cells with a high nuclearcytoplasmic ratio. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cells were positive for myeloperoxidase, while T-cell and B-cell markers were negative. There was no evidence of leukemia cells in peripheral blood or in bone marrow. The tumor was diagnosed as a testicular isolated myeloid sarcoma. Eleven months after the orchiectomy, enlargement of the para-aortic lymph node occurred. There was no evidence of leukemia cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for recurrence of myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor composed of immature myeloid cells. Myeloid sarcoma primarily involving the testis is rare.

Here, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of these autoimmune disorders, specifically in the setting of B-cell malignancies. AIHA and ITP are classically associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but have also been reported in plasmacytic and lymphoproliferative disorders. AIHA includes both warm AIHA and cold agglutinin disease, the latter of which is strongly associated with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. The pathogenesis of these cytopenias varies with the underlying disease, but malignant cells serving as antigen-presenting cells to T lymphocytes, with the generation of autoreactive lymphocytes, may be involved. The diagnosis requires the presence of hemolysis and a positive direct antiglobulin test result. In a minority of cases, the direct antiglobulin test result is negative, and more specialized testing may be required. Data on the prognostic effect of these comorbidities are conflicting, and the prognosis may vary depending on when in the B-cell malignant process the cytopenia(s) develops. The treatment of AIHA and ITP in the setting of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders often involves treatment of the underlying disorder, although in some cases of CLL, treatment of the underlying disorder is not indicated, and management is similar to that for idiopathic AIHA or ITP.","['Durani, Urshila', 'Go, Ronald S', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Durani U', 'Go RS', 'Kay NE']",,"['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['*Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/therapy']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct;16(10):670-676.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the etiology remains largely unknown. Our study aimed to scrutinize the role of NF1 in chemoresistant ovarian cancer and its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS & METHODS: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Western blot, quantitative real-time-PCR and rescue experiments were performed to illustrate the antiapoptotic role of NF1 loss and its underlying mechanism. RESULTS: NF1-knockdown ovarian cells showed resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, NF1 regulated MCL1 expression at protein level. Further dissections suggested that miR-142-5p was regulated by NF1 via its promoter and targeted MCL1. Consistently, miR-142-5p mimic and si-MCL1 can attenuate the antiapoptotic effect of NF1 knockdown. CONCLUSION: NF1 knockdown endowed ovarian cells with resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting MCL1 via miR-142-5p.","['Su, Jiancheng', 'Ruan, Shaolin', 'Dai, Shengkun', 'Mi, Jing', 'Chen, Wei', 'Jiang, Songshan']","['Su J', 'Ruan S', 'Dai S', 'Mi J', 'Chen W', 'Jiang S']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences & Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Biological Sciences & Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Biological Sciences & Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Biological Sciences & Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Biological Sciences & Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN142 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/pgs-2018-0161 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2019 Feb;20(3):155-165. doi: 10.2217/pgs-2018-0161.

IFN-oe2a expression cassette was transferred to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. Three independent transgenic C. reinhartii lines were generated and reported to produce a biologically active IFN-oe2a. The expressed IFN-oe2a was partially purified and tested for their antitumor and antiviral properties. Cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis assays involving the usage of the recombinant C. reinhardtii IFN-oe2a (Cr.

A 28-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia treated with prednisone, tacrolimus, and sorafenib following stem cell transplantation presented with severe bilateral lower extremity claudication. The patient was discharged against medical advice prior to finalizing a cardiovascular evaluation, but returned 1 week later with signs suggestive of septic shock. Laboratory tests revealed troponin I of 12.63 ng/mL, BNP of 1690 pg/mL, and negative infectious workup. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and new pathologic Q waves in the anterior leads. Coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel coronary artery disease. Peripheral angiography revealed severely diseased left anterior and posterior tibial arteries, tibioperoneal trunk, and peroneal artery, and subtotal occlusion of the right posterior tibial artery. Multiple coronary and peripheral drug-eluting stents were implanted. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed chronic left ventricular infarction with some viability, 17% ejection fraction, and left ventricular mural thrombi. The patient opted for medical management. Persistent symptoms 9 months later led to repeat angiography, showing total occlusion of the second obtuse marginal artery due to in-stent restenosis with proximal stent fracture, and chronic total occlusion of the right internal iliac artery extending to the pudendal branch.

Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers. METHODS: Over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database were analyzed to determine the distribution of germline and somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. Subsequently, 7,893 cancer cases were compiled in cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33 most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival times. RESULTS: The data were analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53 mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33 TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in nine cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and thymoma) for survival time and in five cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma) for disease-free survival time. It was also found that the most common p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole. In addition, in cases of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, the co-occurrence of TP53 and BRCA mutations resulted in longer survival and disease-free survival times than the presence of neither TP53 nor BRCA mutations. CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival times of cancer patients.","['Li, Victor D', 'Li, Karen H', 'Li, John T']","['Li VD', 'Li KH', 'Li JT']",,"['Department of Science, The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, NY, USA.', 'Department of Science, The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, NY, USA. likhuijie@gmail.com.', 'Department of Science, The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2817-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2817-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar;145(3):625-636. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2817-z.

Despite the fact that the 5year survival rate has increased from 60 to 90%, approximately a quarter of children suffer from relapse with poor outcome. To improve the clinical management of BALL, there is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of BALL outcomes. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression data of 456 samples from five independent cohorts. We first sought to identify BALLassociated genes by differential gene expression analysis by applying linear models. Then, the statistical modelling was applied to identify candidates related to relapsefree survival. We identified a total of 1,273 BALLassociated genes that have functions relevant to chemokine signaling. From these genes, 59 genes were identified as prognostic biomarkers. Based on expression patterns of these genes, we successfully distinguished high and lowrisk groups of BALL patients (log-rank test, Pvalue=0.025). We further investigated the 59gene expression levels in ALL chemotherapytreated cohorts and identified 4 genes as potential drug targets associated with drug sensitivity. Our results provided a novel biomarker panel. By leveraging the large scale of data and statistical modelling, we believe this 59gene biomarker could help to unveil the mechanisms underlying BALL progression and become potential drug targets.","['Jing, Wei', 'Li, Jing']","['Jing W', 'Li J']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

Lidamycin (LDM) which is a member of the enediyne antibiotic family exhibits extreme cytotoxicity. In the present study, the induction of apoptosis and differentiation in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells by low concentrations of lidamycin were investigated. K562 cells were treated with lidamycin at various concentrations for 48 h, and accumulated in the metaphase as determined in previous experiments. Cell viability was determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the IC50 value of lidamycin was 0.1+/-3.2 nM. Induction of apoptosis was investigated morphologically by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining. Growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were observed in cells treated with low concentrations of lidamycin. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that treatment of the K562 cells with lidamycin at low concentrations upregulated the expression of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The induction of differentiation in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells by lidamycin at low concentrations was also investigated. The nitroblue tetrazolium reduction ability of K562 cells was increased following treatment with lidamycin. Low concentrations of lidamycin triggered erythroid differentiation among K562 cells, indicated by morphological changes, increased hemoglobin content, and the expression of cell surface antigens such as CD71. Additionally the expression of GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA-1) protein in low concentration lidamycin-treated K562 cells was increased. The results of the present study suggest that a low-concentration lidamycin exerts effects on apoptosis and erythroid differentiation induction by increasing the expression of caspases and GATA-1 protein. Lidamycin may serve a positive role in relevant targeted chemotherapy and may represent a potential candidate for chronic myelogenous leukemia differentiation-inducing treatment.","['Zhang, Chu', 'Guo, Lu-Ying', 'Mu, Dan', 'Gong, Jian-Hua', 'Chen, Jing']","['Zhang C', 'Guo LY', 'Mu D', 'Gong JH', 'Chen J']",,"['School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, P.R.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cytokine profile following abrasion of the corneal epithelium, and to identify the cytokines modulated by topical treatment with CAP37 to determine the mechanism by which CAP37 contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and healing of the cornea. The corneal epithelium in mouse eyes was removed and wounds were treated with a saline vehicle or human recombinant CAP37. Wounds were visualized with fluoresce in staining at 0, 16, 24 and 48 h. Mouse corneas were excised at 0, 6, 16, 24 and 48 h post corneal abrasion. The excised corneas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for re-epithelialization and infiltration of inflammatory cells while the expression profiles of thirty-two cytokines were investigated by multiplex analysis. Results corroborating previous studies showed accelerated wound closure in corneas treated with CAP37 compared to those treated with the saline vehicle. Immunohistochemistry revealed less neutrophil infiltration in CAP37-treated corneas when compared to controls at 24 h. By 48 h post-wounding, histological analysis revealed more staining for neutrophils than the staining observed in the controls. Modulation of cytokine expression occurred for the majority of the cytokines tested at the time of corneal abrasion, during re-epithelialization, and/or by CAP37 treatment. Cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were induced during re-epithelialization, at the early 16 h time point. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-12p70, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1beta), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) were induced at 24 h and unchanged during CAP37 treatment. By contrast, IL-15, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), MIP-1alpha, IL-1beta, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were modulated by CAP37 treatment. In general, CAP37 appeared to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines at 24 h and increase them at 48 h when compared to the control group. These data demonstrate that CAP37 modulates the production of cytokines in the cornea and suggest that limiting the number of neutrophils recruited during the early inflammatory phase may support corneal re-epithelialization.","['Kasus-Jacobi, Anne', 'Griffith, Gina L', 'Lerner, Megan', 'Pereira, H Anne']","['Kasus-Jacobi A', 'Griffith GL', 'Lerner M', 'Pereira HA']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Oklahoma Center for Neuroscience, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, Sensory Trauma, Fort Sam Houston, Texas 78234-7767, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Oklahoma Center for Neuroscience, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Cell Biology University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.']",['eng'],"['P30 EY021725/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY015534/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 EY026229/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Ocul Dis Ther,Journal of ocular diseases and therapeutics,101723136,,,,PMC6287921,['NIHMS949667'],2017/01/01 00:00,2017/01/01 00:01,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Ocul Dis Ther. 2017;5:19-27.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Corneal abrasion', 'chemokine', 'corneal re-epithelialization', 'immunohistochemistry', 'interleukin', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'multiplex analysis', 'natural killer cells', 'neutrophil']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of these transcription factors facilitates cell proliferation in cancers, and several members participate in invasion and metastasis by activating certain gene transcriptions. ETS1 and ETS2 are the founding members of the ETS family and regulate transcription by binding to ETS sequences. Three chimeric genes involving ETS genes have been identified in human cancers, which are EWS-FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma, TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer, and ETV6-RUNX1 in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Although these fusion transcripts definitely contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, the impact of these fusion transcripts on patients' prognosis is highly controversial.

Precise quantification of endogenous miRNAs from different clinical patient and control samples combined with a one-to-one comparison to standard technologies is a challenging but necessary endeavor that is largely neglected by many emerging fluorescence technologies. Here, we present a simple, precise, sensitive, and specific ratiometric assay for absolute quantification of miRNAs. Isothermally amplified time-gated Forster resonance energy transfer (TG-FRET) between Tb donors and dye acceptors resulted in miRNA assays with single-nucleotide variant specificity and detection limits down to 4.2 +/- 0.5 attomoles. Quantification of miR-21 from human tissues and plasma samples revealed the relevance for breast and ovarian cancer diagnostics. Analysis of miR-132 and miR-146a from acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) demonstrated the broad applicability to different miRNAs and other types of clinical samples. Direct comparison to the gold standard RT-qPCR showed advantages of amplified TG-FRET concerning precision and specificity when quantifying low concentrations of miRNAs as required for diagnostic applications. Our results demonstrate that a careful implementation of rolling circle amplification and TG-FRET into one straightforward nucleic acid detection method can significantly advance the possibilities of miRNA-based cancer diagnostics and research.","['Qiu, Xue', 'Xu, Jingyue', 'Guo, Jiajia', 'Yahia-Ammar, Akram', 'Kapetanakis, Nikiforos-Ioannis', 'Duroux-Richard, Isabelle', 'Unterluggauer, Julia J', 'Golob-Schwarzl, Nicole', 'Regeard, Christophe', 'Uzan, Catherine', 'Gouy, Sebastien', 'DuBow, Michael', 'Haybaeck, Johannes', 'Apparailly, Florence', 'Busson, Pierre', 'Hildebrandt, Niko']","['Qiu X', 'Xu J', 'Guo J', 'Yahia-Ammar A', 'Kapetanakis NI', 'Duroux-Richard I', 'Unterluggauer JJ', 'Golob-Schwarzl N', 'Regeard C', 'Uzan C', 'Gouy S', 'DuBow M', 'Haybaeck J', 'Apparailly F', 'Busson P', 'Hildebrandt N']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6423-201X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7539-9288', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1762-084X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1027-3400', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8767-9623']","['NanoBioPhotonics , Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC) , Universite Paris-Saclay , Universite Paris-Sud , CNRS , CEA , Orsay , France .

Herein, we aimed to report an immunosuppression- related PRES case. A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed as t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed. Cyclosporine was given for GVHD prophylaxis in addition to the other routine medications of HSCT. She was hospitalized for acute renal failure and due to the possible contribution of acute renal failure cyclosporine was stopped. Tacrolimus was started for GVHD prophylaxis at a dose of 1 mg/day. However, fifteen days after the initiation of tacrolimus, blurred vision occurred in our patient. Petechial bleeding sites were detected in bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemisphere by MR imaging. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced to 0.5 mg/day. She had hypertension which was difficult to control and followed-up in the intensive care unit. She had seizures. Control cranial MR resulted as diffusion limitation in bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, bilateral occipital and frontal-parietal regions with vasogenic edema findings; contrast involvement in left frontal-parietal and right cerebellar regions. She had vision loss and lethargy. Control cranial MR favored PRES syndrome secondary to immunosuppression. Hypertensive state was taken under control with antihypertensive treatment and all immunosuppressive agents were stopped. Two weeks later her clinical condition was slightly improved. MR test which was conducted 2 weeks after the diagnosis revealed the regression of PRES lesions. The characteristic signs on neuroimaging are the symmetrical white matter edema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres, particularly the parietal- occipital regions. In conclusion, PRES rarely develops secondary to the immunosuppressive agents and the clinicians should suspect and promptly diagnose PRES which might cause otherwise serious irreversible clinical complications.","['Malkan, Umit Y', 'Gunes, Gursel', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Goker, Hakan']","['Malkan UY', 'Gunes G', 'Demiroglu H', 'Goker H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,PMC6240836,,2018/12/14 06:00,2018/12/14 06:01,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2018.7257 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2018 Nov 6;10(4):7257. doi: 10.4081/hr.2018.7257. eCollection 2018 Nov 6.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome', 'immunosuppression', 'leukemia']",,,20181106,,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no potential conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognosis of the two cohorts is quite different. The present aim was to review and evaluate one potential cause of why survival is poorer in adult ALL than pediatric ALL via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Clinical significant features were analyzed in 282 ALL cases. FISH was performed to study mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation and the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome in newly diagnosed patients, and was used to detect trisomy 4 or 10 and the translocation ETS leukemia-acute myeloid leukemia 1 (TEL-AML1) fusion gene. The overall survival/event-free survival (OS/EFS) outcome of adult ALL and pediatric ALL was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Adult ALL had a higher median leukocyte count and lower hemoglobin level than pediatric ALL. FISH revealed that Ph positivity (Ph+) was associated with the high-risk feature of older age. In pediatric ALL, trisomy 4 or 10 was present in 71/207 cases (34.3%), while the TEL-AML1 fusion gene was present in 16/207 cases (7.7%). By contrast, there were very few such positive cases in adult ALL. Survival analysis revealed that, in adult ALL, the 3-year OS and EFS rates were higher in the Ph-negative group than in the Ph+ group. Adult or pediatric ALL is an independent prognostic factor of OS. The present analysis of the clinical and biological features between adult and pediatric ALL indicates that adult ALL has a poorer prognosis than pediatric ALL based on Ph+ status and presence of trisomy 4 or 10. Ph+ ALL is an independent prognosis factor of ALL. FISH may serve an important role in the comparison of prognostic factors in adult and pediatric ALL.","['Cao, Pengfei', 'Yu, Yalan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Xu, He', 'He, Yuxiang']","['Cao P', 'Yu Y', 'Wang W', 'Xu H', 'He Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, P.R.

The function of innate immune components and adaptive immune components are interlinked in hematological malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and molecular interactions between innate and adaptive immune components are crucial for the development, progression and the therapeutic outcome of CLL. In this leukemia, genetic mutations in B cells and B cell receptors (BCR) are key driving factors along with evasion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and promotion of regulatory T cells. Similarly, the release of various cytokines from CLL cells triggers the protumor phenotype in macrophages that further edges the CLL cells. Moreover, under the influence of various cytokines, dendritic cells are unable to mature and trigger T cell mediated antitumor response. The phenotypes of these cells are ultimately controlled by respective signaling pathways, the most notables are BCR, Wnt, Notch, and NF-kappaB, and their activation affects the cytokine profile that controls the pathogenesis of CLL, and challenge its treatment. There are several novel substances for CLL under clinical development, including kinase inhibitors, antibodies, and immune-modulators that offer new hopes. DC-based vaccines and CAR T cell therapy are promising tools; however, further studies are required to precisely dissect the molecular interactions among various molecular entities. In this review, we systematically discuss the involvement, common targets and therapeutic interventions of various cells for the better understanding and therapy of CLL.","['Haseeb, Muhammad', 'Anwar, Muhammad Ayaz', 'Choi, Sangdun']","['Haseeb M', 'Anwar MA', 'Choi S']",,"['Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', '*Cancer Vaccines/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/pathology']",PMC6277854,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/10/03 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02720 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Nov 26;9:2720. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02720. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*T cell', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*crosstalk', '*dendritic cell', '*leukemia therapy', '*macrophage']",,,20181126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently described in several chemorefractory elderly AML patients that a novel biomodulatory treatment regimen consisting of low-dose azacitidine (AZA) in combination with PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone (PGZ) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced complete remission of leukemia and also triggered myeloid differentiation with rapid increase of peripheral blood neutrophils. Herein, we further investigated our observations and comprehensively analyzed cell differentiation in primary AML blasts after treatment with ATRA, AZA, and PGZ ex vivo. The drug combination was found to significantly inhibit cell growth as well as to induce cell differentiation in about half of primary AML blasts samples independent of leukemia subtype. Notably and in comparison to ATRA/AZA/PGZ triple-treatment, effects on cell growth and myeloid differentiation with ATRA monotherapy was much less efficient. Morphological signs of myeloid cell differentiation were further confirmed on a functional basis by demonstrating increased production of reactive oxygen species as well as enhanced phagocytic activity in AML blasts treated with ATRA/AZA/PGZ. In conclusion, we show that biomodulatory treatment with ATRA/AZA/PGZ can induce phenotypical and functional differentiation of primary AML blasts into neutrophil like cells, which aside from its antileukemic activity may lower neutropenia associated infection rates in elderly AML patients in vivo. Clinical impact of the ATRA/AZA/PGZ treatment regimen is currently further investigated in a randomized clinical trial in chemorefractory AML patients (NCT02942758).","['Klobuch, Sebastian', 'Steinberg, Tim', 'Bruni, Emanuele', 'Mirbeth, Carina', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Ghibelli, Lina', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Thomas, Simone']","['Klobuch S', 'Steinberg T', 'Bruni E', 'Mirbeth C', 'Heilmeier B', 'Ghibelli L', 'Herr W', 'Reichle A', 'Thomas S']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hospital Barmherzige Brueder, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6278634,,2018/12/14 06:00,2018/12/14 06:01,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.01380 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Nov 27;9:1380. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.01380. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'azacitidine', 'differentiation', 'pioglitazone']",,,20181127,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02942758'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we developed an automated risk-stratification system based on BMPCs features, with independent prognostic impact on progression-free and overall survival of AL amyloidosis patients (hazard ratio: >/= 2.9;P </= .03). Simultaneous assessment of the clonal PCs immunophenotypic protein expression profile and the BM cellular composition, mapped AL amyloidosis in the crossroad between MGUS and MM; however, lack of homogenously-positive CD56 expression, reduction of B-cell precursors and a predominantly-clonal PC compartment in the absence of an MM-like tumor PC expansion, emerged as hallmarks of AL amyloidosis (ROC-AUC = 0.74;P < .001), and might potentially be used as biomarkers for the identification of MGUS and MM patients, who are candidates for monitoring pre-symptomatic organ damage related to AL amyloidosis. Altogether, this study addressed the need for consensus on how to use flow cytometry in AL amyloidosis, and proposes a standardized MFC-based automated risk classification ready for implementation in clinical practice.","['Puig, Noemi', 'Paiva, Bruno', 'Lasa, Marta', 'Burgos, Leire', 'Perez, Jose J', 'Merino, Juana', 'Moreno, Cristina', 'Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Toboso, Dolores Gomez', 'Cedena, Maria-Teresa', 'Ocio, Enrique M', 'Lecumberri, Ramon', 'Garcia de Coca, Alfonso', 'Labrador, Jorge', 'Gonzalez, Maria-Esther', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Gironella, Mercedes', 'Cabanas, Valentin', 'Casanova, Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Krsnik, Isabel', 'Perez-Montana, Albert', 'de la Rubia, Javier', 'de la Puerta, Jose-Enrique', 'de Arriba, Felipe', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Lecrevisse, Quentin', 'Verde, Javier', 'Mateos, Maria-Victoria', 'Lahuerta, Juan-Jose', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'San Miguel, Jesus F']","['Puig N', 'Paiva B', 'Lasa M', 'Burgos L', 'Perez JJ', 'Merino J', 'Moreno C', 'Vidriales MB', 'Toboso DG', 'Cedena MT', 'Ocio EM', 'Lecumberri R', 'Garcia de Coca A', 'Labrador J', 'Gonzalez ME', 'Palomera L', 'Gironella M', 'Cabanas V', 'Casanova M', 'Oriol A', 'Krsnik I', 'Perez-Montana A', 'de la Rubia J', 'de la Puerta JE', 'de Arriba F', 'Prosper F', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Verde J', 'Mateos MV', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Orfao A', 'San Miguel JF']",,"['Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain. bpaiva@unav.es.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, CNIO, Universidad Complutese CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), IDISNA, CIBERONC Pamplona, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Hospital de Cabuenes, Gijon, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza, Spain.', ""Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital Costa del Sol, Marbella, Spain.', ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Son Espases, Palma, Spain.', 'Hospital Doctor Peset, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer.

We introduce and validate a post-treatment approach of leukemic stem cell (LSC) assessment for prediction of outcome. LSC containing CD34+CD38- fractions were measured using flow cytometry in an add-on study of the HOVON102/SAKK trial. Predefined cut-off levels were prospectively evaluated to assess CD34+CD38-LSC levels at diagnosis (n = 594), and, to identify LSC(low)/LSC(high) (n = 302) and MRD(low)/MRD(high) patients (n = 305) in bone marrow in morphological complete remission (CR). In 242 CR patients combined MRD and LSC results were available. At diagnosis the CD34(+)CD38(-) LSC frequency independently predicts overall survival (OS). After achieving CR, combining LSC and MRD showed reduced survival in MRD(high)/LSC(high) patients (hazard ratio [HR] 3.62 for OS and 5.89 for cumulative incidence of relapse [CIR]) compared to MRD(low)/LSC(high), MRD(high)/LSC(low), and especially MRD(low)/LSC(low) patients. Moreover, in the NPM1mutant positive sub-group, prognostic value of golden standard NPM1-MRD by qPCR can be improved by addition of flow cytometric approaches. This is the first prospective study demonstrating that LSC strongly improves prognostic impact of MRD detection, identifying a patient subgroup with an almost 100% treatment failure probability, warranting consideration of LSC measurement incorporation in future AML risk schemes.","['Zeijlemaker, Wendelien', 'Grob, Tim', 'Meijer, Rosa', 'Hanekamp, Diana', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Carbaat-Ham, Jannemieke C', 'Oussoren-Brockhoff, Yvonne J M', 'Snel, Alexander N', 'Veldhuizen, Dennis', 'Scholten, Willemijn J', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Breems, Dimitri A', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Manz, Markus G', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Slomp, Jennichjen', 'Preijers, Frank', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Zeijlemaker W', 'Grob T', 'Meijer R', 'Hanekamp D', 'Kelder A', 'Carbaat-Ham JC', 'Oussoren-Brockhoff YJM', 'Snel AN', 'Veldhuizen D', 'Scholten WJ', 'Maertens J', 'Breems DA', 'Pabst T', 'Manz MG', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'Slomp J', 'Preijers F', 'Cloos J', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJM', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4676-7931'],"['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical trial Center- HOVON data center, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Medisch Spectrum Twente/Medlon, Enschede, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine - Laboratory for Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, RUNMC, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. gj.schuurhuis@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', '*Cell Count', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0326-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0326-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 May;33(5):1102-1112. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0326-3.

In the present study, we found that overexpression of M-CSFR was present in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cases. M-CSFR signaling was associated with lymphoma cell proliferation, and M-CSFR inhibition induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells. The ATLL cell line ATL-T expressed M-CSF/CSF-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, which are both M-CSFR ligands. M-CSF and IL-34 expression was seen in ATLL cases, and co-expression of these ligands was detected in 11 of 13 ATLL cases. M-CSFR inhibition suppressed programmed death-1 and -2 ligand in ATL-T cells and macrophages stimulated with conditioned medium from ATL-T cells.

The FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase plays an integral role in hematopoiesis, and one third of AML diagnoses exhibit gain-of-function mutations in FLT3, with the juxtamembrane domain internal tandem duplication (ITD) and the kinase domain D835Y variants observed most frequently. Few FLT3 substrates or phosphorylation sites are known, which limits insight into FLT3's substrate preferences and makes assay design particularly challenging. We applied in vitro phosphorylation of a cell lysate digest (adaptation of the Kinase Assay Linked with Phosphoproteomics (KALIP) technique and similar methods) for high-throughput identification of substrates for three FLT3 variants (wild-type, ITD mutant, and D835Y mutant). Incorporation of identified substrate sequences as input into the KINATEST-ID substrate preference analysis and assay development pipeline facilitated the design of several peptide substrates that are phosphorylated efficiently by all three FLT3 kinase variants. These substrates could be used in assays to identify new FLT3 inhibitors that overcome resistant mutations to improve FLT3-positive AML treatment.","['Perez, Minervo', 'Blankenhorn, John', 'Murray, Kevin J', 'Parker, Laurie L']","['Perez M', 'Blankenhorn J', 'Murray KJ', 'Parker LL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2768-4954', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6234-3346']","['From the double daggerUniversity of Minnesota, Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, 420 Washington Avenue SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'section signPurdue University, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, 201 S.

Approval was based on data from Study CLTR0310-301, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing Vyxeos with a standard combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine (""7+3"") in 309 patients 60-75 years of age with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. Because of elemental copper concerns with the Vyxeos formulation, patients with Wilson disease were excluded from the study. Vyxeos demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P = 0.005) with an estimated median overall survival of 9.6 months compared with 5.9 months for the ""7+3"" control arm. The toxicity profile of Vyxeos was similar to that seen with standard ""7+3"" with the exception of more prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on the Vyxeos arm. Because the pharmacology of Vyxeos differs from that of other formulations of daunorubicin and cytarabine, labeling includes a warning against interchanging formulations during treatment.

Leukemia represents a class of hematologic malignancies that is characterized by dysregulation of cell death pathways and treatment-related resistance. As the majority of chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs kill leukemia cells by triggering apoptosis, the observed resistance indicates the need for novel therapeutic strategies to reactivate nonapoptotic cell death programs in refractory leukemia. Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis that is precisely modulated by intracellular signaling pathways and thus provides potential molecular targets for rational therapeutic intervention. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that many current antitumor agents can activate necroptotic pathways and thereby induce leukemia cell death. Elucidation of the complete regulatory mechanism of necroptosis is expected to accelerate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming apoptosis resistance in leukemia. Here, we review the latest research advances in the regulatory mechanisms of necroptosis and summarize the progression of necroptosis-based therapeutic strategies in leukemia.","['Huang, Xianbo', 'Xiao, Feng', 'Li, Yuan', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Ding, Wei', 'Ye, Xiujin']","['Huang X', 'Xiao F', 'Li Y', 'Qian W', 'Ding W', 'Ye X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4553-2751'],"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, the First Hospital of Jiaxing, Jiaxing, 314000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 1181010@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China. yxjsunny@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Y201635961/Department of Education of Zhejiang Province', 'Y201636714/Department of Education of Zhejiang Province', '2016C33137/Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province', '2019KY693/Department of Health of Zhejiang Province', '2016KYB095/Department of Health of Zhejiang Province']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Necrosis/chemically induced']",PMC6291981,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0976-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0976-z [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Dec 12;37(1):310. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0976-z.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis resistance', 'Leukemia', 'MLKL', 'Necroptosis', 'RIPK1', 'RIPK3']",,,20181212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most information on treatment cessation was obtained from clinical trials with strict recruiting criteria. METHODS: We evaluated the outcome of 25 patients with CML that discontinued TKI therapy in our institute in real-world clinical practice. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 76% discontinued therapy in sustained deep molecular response (SDMR) and 24% were in unsustained DMR (UDMR). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects was observed in 5 and 50% of the patients in the SDMR and UDMR groups, respectively. After TKI discontinuation, patients were followed for a median of 24 months. At the time of this analysis, 56% patients had a molecular relapse after a median of 4 months. SDMR and longer treatment duration were associated with lower probability of molecular relapse: 25% in SDMR patients with TKI treatment > 96 months and 85% in UDMR patients with TKI treatment </=96 months. All relapsed patients promptly resumed TKI therapy and regained at least major molecular response (MMR). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TKI discontinuation is safe outside clinical trials and particularly effective in CML patients who are in SDMR with longer TKI treatment duration.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Loureiro, Bruno', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Correia, Cecilia', 'Torres, Lurdes', 'Lisboa, Susana', 'Vieira, Joana', 'Santos, Rui', 'Pereira, Dulcineia', 'Moreira, Claudia', 'Chacim, Sergio', 'Domingues, Nelson', 'Espirito-Santo, Ana', 'Oliveira, Isabel', 'Moreira, Ilidia', 'Viterbo, Luisa', 'Martins, Angelo', 'Teixeira, Manuel R', 'Mariz, Jose M']","['Cerveira N', 'Loureiro B', 'Bizarro S', 'Correia C', 'Torres L', 'Lisboa S', 'Vieira J', 'Santos R', 'Pereira D', 'Moreira C', 'Chacim S', 'Domingues N', 'Espirito-Santo A', 'Oliveira I', 'Moreira I', 'Viterbo L', 'Martins A', 'Teixeira MR', 'Mariz JM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5098-3840'],"['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal. nscerveira@gmail.com.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICBAS), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Haematology, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/trends', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Withholding Treatment/*trends', 'Young Adult']",PMC6292043,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-5167-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-5167-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Dec 12;18(1):1245. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-5167-y.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Sustained deep molecular response', 'TKI discontinuation', 'TKI therapy duration', 'Unsustained deep molecular response']",,,20181212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical picture is not specific. Patients become more immunocompromised and malnourished after repeated evacuations. Chylothorax is usually diagnosed when the triglyceride level is > 1.24 mmol/l and the cholesterol level is < 5.18 mmol/ l in the effusion. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy of the associated malignant tumors has been used as the first-line treatment of malignant chylothorax. The responses of chylothorax after 3-8 chemotherapy courses have been described. A few cases of indolent lymphoma associated with chylothorax that were treated with fludarabine-based chemotherapies with various outcomes have been published. Total parenteral nutrition or a low-fat diet combined with ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides can accelerate remission of chylothorax. OBSERVATION: This study presents two cases with chylothorax associated with a bulky abdominal mass in relapsed CLL and newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma, respectively. No further evacuations were required after one and three courses of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide with/without rituximab in the patients with CLL and follicular lymphoma, respectively. Chylothorax disappeared after five courses, and a partial or complete response of malignant lymphoma was achieved. The response lasted for 30 months in the patient with CLL and has persisted throughout maintenance therapy with rituximab in the patient with follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Limited experience indicates that fludarabine-based regimes can result in rapid regression of chylothorax, in addition to treating indolent lymphoma, which prevents patients becoming more malnourished and immunocompromised.

Patients with these diseases are highly immunosuppressed and therefore at a high risk of serious infections. This study aimed to perform active surveillance of enterobacteria, which cause these infections, and to determine their antibiotic resistance in patients with AL who were hospitalized at the Hemato-Oncology Center of University Hospital Olomouc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved 49 patients with AL, of whom 37 had AML (16 women and 21 men) and 12 had ALL (6 women and 6 men). The mean age of the patients was 50.5 years. Samples of clinical material were obtained over 12 months (September 2015 to August 2016) and subjected to standard microbiological examinations. Bacterial strains were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and their antibiotic susceptibility was established by microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 292 samples were obtained from patients with AL. Some of these samples were excluded from analysis to prevent the inclusion of identical strains from the same patient. Consequently, 146 clinical samples obtained from the following nine types of clinical materials were analyzed - throat swabs (n = 47), stools (n = 40), urine (n = 33), hemocultures (n = 11), buccal swabs (n = 5), perianal swabs (n = 4), wound swabs (n = 3), sputum (n = 2), and puncture fluid (n = 1). The most prevalent enterobacteria was Escherichia coli (n = 42), followed by Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), specifically Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 34) and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 12), and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 19). The most of enterobacteria were highly resistant to many tested antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria colonize patients with hemato-oncological diseases and can cause serious infections. These antibiotic-resistant microorganisms are a serious and frequent problem. These findings together with the high level of immunosuppression mean that patients with hemato-oncological diseases are at a high risk of developing serious infections and consequently active surveillance is crucial.","['Simona, Zatloukalova', 'Ondrej, Holy', 'Jana, Petrzelova', 'Patrik, Mlynarcik', 'Jana, Vlckova', 'Magdalena, Roderova', 'Dagmar, Horakova', 'Helena, Kollarova']","['Simona Z', 'Ondrej H', 'Jana P', 'Patrik M', 'Jana V', 'Magdalena R', 'Dagmar H', 'Helena K']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Microbial', '*Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*microbiology']",,,2018/12/14 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2018/12/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['105207 [pii]', '10.14735/amko2018282 [doi]']",ppublish,Klin Onkol.

To identify therapeutic strategies targeting LSCs, while sparing healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we performed gene expression profiling of LSCs, HSCs, and leukemic progenitors all residing within the same AML bone marrow and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as differentially expressed. Low IGFBP7 is a feature of LSCs and is associated with reduced chemotherapy sensitivity. Enhancing IGFBP7 by overexpression or addition of recombinant human IGFBP7 (rhIGFBP7) resulted in differentiation, inhibition of cell survival, and increased chemotherapy sensitivity of primary AML cells. Adding rhIGFBP7 reduced leukemic stem and/or progenitor survival and reversed a stem-like gene signature, but it had no influence on normal hematopoietic stem cell survival. Our data suggest a potential clinical utility of the addition of rhIGFBP7 to current chemotherapy regimens to decrease AML relapse rates.","['Verhagen, Han J M P', 'van Gils, Noortje', 'Martianez, Tania', 'van Rhenen, Anna', 'Rutten, Arjo', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'de Leeuw, David C', 'Smit, Marjon A', 'Tsui, Mei-Ling', 'de Vos Klootwijk, Louise L E', 'Menezes, Renee X', 'Cil, Meyram', 'Roemer, Margaretha G M', 'Vermue, Eline', 'Heukelom, Stan', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Smit, Linda']","['Verhagen HJMP', 'van Gils N', 'Martianez T', 'van Rhenen A', 'Rutten A', 'Denkers F', 'de Leeuw DC', 'Smit MA', 'Tsui ML', 'de Vos Klootwijk LLE', 'Menezes RX', 'Cil M', 'Roemer MGM', 'Vermue E', 'Heukelom S', 'Zweegman S', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Smit L']",,"['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

DUX4 regulates expression of repetitive elements during early embryogenesis, but misexpression of DUX4 causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and translocations overexpressing the DUX4 double homeodomain cause B cell leukemia. Here, we report the crystal structure of the tandem homeodomains of DUX4 bound to DNA. The homeodomains bind DNA in a head-to-head fashion, with the linker making anchoring DNA minor-groove interactions and unique protein contacts. Remarkably, despite being tandem duplicates, the DUX4 homeodomains recognize different core sequences. This results from an arginine-to-glutamate mutation, unique to primates, causing alternative positioning of a key arginine side chain in the recognition helix. Mutational studies demonstrate that this primate-specific change is responsible for the divergence in sequence recognition that likely drove coevolution of embryonically regulated repeats in primates. Our work provides a framework for understanding the endogenous function of DUX4 and its role in FSHD and cancer.","['Lee, John K', 'Bosnakovski, Darko', 'Toso, Erik A', 'Dinh, Tracy', 'Banerjee, Surajit', 'Bohl, Thomas E', 'Shi, Ke', 'Orellana, Kayo', 'Kyba, Michael', 'Aihara, Hideki']","['Lee JK', 'Bosnakovski D', 'Toso EA', 'Dinh T', 'Banerjee S', 'Bohl TE', 'Shi K', 'Orellana K', 'Kyba M', 'Aihara H']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Faculty of Medical Sciences, Goce Delcev University-Stip, Krste Misirkov b.b., 2000 Stip, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Northeastern Collaborative Access Team, Cornell University, Advanced Photon Source, Lemont, IL 60439, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

The Integrated Personalized Nursing Diagnosis (IPND).",50-59,10.23750/abm.v89i7-S.7931 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The nursing diagnosis can based on two different approaches: the standard diagnosis, searching for regularities that can fall within pre-existing categories identified by the nurse, as the expert of the disease; the narrative diagnosis, based on personal meaning attributed to the illness, of which only the patient is the expert. The aim of this work is to underline the usefulness of integration between standard diagnosis and narrative diagnosis, through the Integrated Personalized Nursing Diagnosis (IPND). METHODS: A 31 years old man, suffering from leukaemia, is welcomed at an Italian Oncological Day Hospital, by a nurse trained in the IPND approach. She used the Gordon functional models on objective data, and collected a narration about patient's experience, which has been analyzed with a Grounded Theory methodology. RESULTS: The narrative revealed critical issues and the priorities that patient assigns, which would not have been obtained from a standard diagnosis. From the standard diagnosis, however, emerge several aspects that the patient has neglected to narrate and that does not directly address in his story. The diagnostic integration allowed the nurse to define a conceptual map of problems and resources in a personalized manner. CONCLUSION: The IPND not only gives importance to the priorities of the patient, but also underlines the dynamic path, in which not only the static analysis of needs becomes significant, but also the changes that occur in attributing new meanings to the life experience, as well as the evolution of the person him/herself in this process.","['Artioli, Giovanna', 'Foa, Chiara', 'Taffurelli, Chiara', 'Cosentino, Chiara']","['Artioli G', 'Foa C', 'Taffurelli C', 'Cosentino C']",,['. giovanna.artioli@unipr.it.'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Acta Biomed,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,101295064,['V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cortisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*nursing/psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Narration', '*Nurse-Patient Relations', '*Nursing Diagnosis', '*Precision Medicine', 'Self Concept', 'Weight Loss']",PMC6502143,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/11/23 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23750/abm.v89i7-S.7931 [doi]'],epublish,Acta Biomed. 2018 Dec 7;89(7-S):50-59. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i7-S.7931.,,,,,,,,20181207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, NFkB regulation constitutes an attractive target to overcome the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in anticancer therapy. Curcumin, as a chemopreventive agent, has a potential role in inhibiting cell growth in a variety of malignancies. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of curcumin along with tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in KCL-22 myeloid cells along with an investigation of the mechanism by which both the agents exert their effects. Materials and Methods: KCL-22 cells were exposed to different doses of curcumin and TRAIL alone and in combination. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, caspase activity by fluorescent method, protein expression by western Blot, and NFkB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, respectively. Results: Cell viability assay revealed that when both the agents, curcumin and TRAIL, were used together, there was reduced cell viability in dose- and time-dependent manner as compared to each agent alone. Curcumin and TRAIL enhanced the caspase-3 activity as compared to caspase-8 and caspase-9. Both the agents induced apoptosis in KCL-22 cells by suppressing the IkappaB kinase and NFkB activity. Conclusion: Our results conclude that curcumin and TRAIL effectively induce the apoptosis through the inhibition of NFkB activity and by enhancing the caspase-3 activity. Thus, curcumin may prove as a potent inhibitor of NFkB by representing its role in cancer pathogenesis, especially in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.","['Iqbal, Bushra', 'Ghildiyal, Archna', 'Singh, Shraddha', 'Siddiqui, Sahabjada', 'Kumari, Pratibha', 'Arshad, M', 'Mahdi, A A']","['Iqbal B', 'Ghildiyal A', 'Singh S', 'Siddiqui S', 'Kumari P', 'Arshad M', 'Mahdi AA']",,"[""Department of Physiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", ""Department of Physiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", ""Department of Physiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", ""Department of Biotechnology, Era's Lucknow Medical College & Hospital, Era University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", 'Department of Zoology, Lucknow University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', ""Department of Biochemistry, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2018_14_12_1193_245021 [pii]', '10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_348_18 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2018 Dec;14(Supplement):S1193-S1200. doi: 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_348_18.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Caspases', 'IkappaB kinase', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'curcumin', 'nuclear factor kappa', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand']",,,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to gain a better understanding of siblings' experiences of living in a family where one child has been diagnosed with blood cancer. METHOD: Ten siblings of children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma completed a semistructured interview about their everyday family life experiences postdiagnosis. The verbatim transcripts of the interviews served as the data for an interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that overall the siblings experienced a continuity in many aspects of their family life: they still experienced their family as an important source of support and information/communication, as warm and loving and as a safe harbor where family members aim to protect each other. However, at the same time, the participating siblings also expressed that some things felt unmistakably different postdiagnosis: They felt that their family as a whole had been ripped apart, with a greater focus on the diagnosed child and changing responsibilities for each family member. CONCLUSION: This study informs parents and clinicians about the daily family life experiences from the siblings' perspective, a perspective that is often overlooked. A focus on challenges as well as continuities within family life, the wish for connection expressed by the siblings, and the uniqueness of every sibling's experiences is what can be taken away from this study by psychosocial workers in the field.","['Van Schoors, Marieke', 'De Mol, Jan', 'Laeremans, Natacha', 'Verhofstadt, Lesley L', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Van Parys, Hanna']","['Van Schoors M', 'De Mol J', 'Laeremans N', 'Verhofstadt LL', 'Goubert L', 'Van Parys H']",,"['1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '2 Universite Catholic de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '1 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '3 University Hospital Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/*psychology', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Siblings/*psychology', '*Stress, Psychological']",,,2018/12/13 06:00,2020/05/26 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454218818067 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2019 Mar/Apr;36(2):131-142. doi: 10.1177/1043454218818067.

Particularly, for CAR T-cells redirected toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML) antigens myelosuppression can be a challenge. The previously validated inducible Caspase9 (iC9) suicide gene system is one of the approaches to control the infused cells in vivo through its activation with a nontherapeutic chemical inducer of dimerizer (CID). We performed a preclinical validation using a model of CD33(+) AML, and generated iC9 CAR T-cells co-expressing a CAR targeting the AML-associated antigen CD33 and a selectable marker (DeltaCD19). DeltaCD19 selected (sel.) iC9-CAR.CD33 T-cells were effective in controlling leukemia growth in vitro, and could be partially eliminated (76%) using a chemical inducer of dimerization that activates iC9. Moreover, to completely eliminate residual cells, a second targeted agent was added. Future plans with these methods are to investigate the utility of iC9-CAR.CD33 T-cells as part of the conditioning therapy for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additional strategies that we are currently validating include (1) the modulation of the suicide gene activation, using different concentrations of the inducing agent(s), to be able to eliminate CAR T-cells modified by a regulatable gene, ideally aiming at preserving a proportion of the infused cells (and their antitumor activity) for mild to moderate toxicities, or (2) the co-expression of an inhibitory CAR aiming at sparing normal cells co-expressing an antigen not shared with the tumor.","['Minagawa, Kentaro', 'Al-Obaidi, Mustafa', 'Di Stasi, Antonio']","['Minagawa K', 'Al-Obaidi M', 'Di Stasi A']",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA. adistasi@uabmc.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Caspase 9/*genetics', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*immunology']",,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-8922-5_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1895:57-73. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8922-5_5.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*AP1903', '*CD33', '*Chimeric antigen receptor', '*Dimerizing agent', '*Inducible caspase 9', '*Safety switch', '*Suicide gene']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study was conducted to further investigate the role of downregulating MALT1 in the development of immunodeficiency in T cells. Methods: We induced activation inhibition in CD3(+) T cells by MALT1 knockdown. Then we characterized the gene expression profile after MALT1 suppression by microarray analysis. Result: The differentially expressed genes were ZAP-70, p65, MDM2, ATM, NFATC2 which participate in the NF-kappaB, p53, and NFAT pathways in CD3(+) T cells after MALT1 downregulation. Conclusion: MALT1 suppression may contribute to immunodeficiency in T cells via suppression of T cell activation and proliferation pathways.

One approach is the targeting of ALL blasts with the Pseudomonas immunotoxin CAT-8015. Although CAT-8015 has potent anti-leukemia activity, with a 32% objective response rate in a phase 1 study of childhood ALL, haemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and vascular leak syndrome (VLS), major dose-limiting toxicities, have limited the use of this therapeutic approach in children. Investigations into the pathogenesis of CAT-8015-induced HUS/VLS are hindered by the lack of an adequate model system that replicates clinical manifestations, but damage to vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and blood cells are believed to be major initiating factors in both syndromes. Since there is little evidence that murine models replicate human HUS/VLS, and CAT-8015-induced HUS/VLS predominantly affects children, we developed human models and used novel methodologies to investigate CAT-8015 interactions with red blood cells (RBCs) from pediatric ALL patients and ECs of excised human mesenteric arteries. We provide evidence that CAT-8015 directly interacts with RBCs, mediated by Pseudomonas toxin.

HCL is a lymphoid malignancy of mature B cells, and MCC derives from neuroendocrine cell origin. HCL has a favorable prognosis with most patients achieving long-term remission and potential cure. In contrast, MCC is an aggressive malignancy affecting the skin and can metastasize quickly with a dismal prognosis. Immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, posttransplant, and the elderly, have higher incidences than the general population, suggesting a possible immune mechanism. We report a case where a patient presented with HCL and metastatic MCC synchronously. This is the first reported case of these two rare malignancies occurring concurrently at initial presentation and may represent a role of immunosuppression in the pathogenesis of MCC.","['Prakash, Ajay', 'Khalafallah, Alhossain A']","['Prakash A', 'Khalafallah AA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7399-1173', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2399-3311']","['Tasmanian Medical Laboratory, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Specialist Care Australia, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Specialist Care Australia, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,,,,PMC6261234,,2018/12/13 06:00,2018/12/13 06:01,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/1736854 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2018 Nov 14;2018:1736854. doi: 10.1155/2018/1736854. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that camalexin has potent antitumor properties, but its underlying mechanisms are still elusive. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of camalexin on human leukemic cells and normal polymorph nuclear cells. CCK-8 assay was used to determine cell viability after camalexin treatment. Apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured by flow cytometry. The activity of SOD, catalase, and ratio of GSH/GSSG were assayed. ER stress and apoptotic signaling pathway was examined by Western blot. Xenograft mice were used to verify the effect of camalexin in vivo. Our results indicated that camalexin inhibited viability of leukemic but not normal polymorph nuclear cells. Furthermore, camalexin induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in a caspase-dependent manner. We also observed ER stress is located upstream of apoptosis induced by camalexin. Besides, ROS levels, SOD activity, CAT activity, and GSSG levels were significantly enhanced while the GSH level was decreased after treatment of camalexin. In addition, the generation of ROS is critical for the ER stress and apoptosis induced by camalexin. Finally, administration of camalexin suppresses xenograft tumor graft growth without obvious toxicity. Taken together, this study indicates that camalexin exerts antitumor effects against leukemia cells via the ROS-ER stress-mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.","['Yang, Yang', 'Wang, Gang', 'Wu, Wenjun', 'Yao, Shunnan', 'Han, Xiaoyan', 'He, Donghua', 'He, Jingsong', 'Zheng, Gaofeng', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Yu, Rui']","['Yang Y', 'Wang G', 'Wu W', 'Yao S', 'Han X', 'He D', 'He J', 'Zheng G', 'Zhao Y', 'Cai Z', 'Yu R']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6026-3804', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2330-6937']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315200 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310006 Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315200 Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (camalexin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6261074,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/7426950 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2018 Nov 14;2018:7426950. doi: 10.1155/2018/7426950. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coinhibitory receptors include programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), which suppress immune responses. Coinhibitory receptors are highly expressed on exhausted virus-specific T cells, indicating that viruses evade host immune responses through enhanced expression of these molecules. Human retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), infect T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Therefore, one needs to consider the effects of coinhibitory receptors on both uninfected effector T cells and infected target cells. Coinhibitory receptors are implicated not only in the suppression of immune responses to viruses by inhibition of effector T cells, but also in the persistence of infected cells in vivo. Here we review recent studies on coinhibitory receptors and their roles in retroviral infections such as HIV and HTLV-1.","['Yasuma-Mitobe, Keiko', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Yasuma-Mitobe K', 'Matsuoka M']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC6277675,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02755 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Nov 27;9:2755. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02755. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*PD-1', '*TIGIT', '*co-inhibitory receptor']",,,20181127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This meta-analysis determined the risk of thiopurine-induced leukopenia conferred by the NUDT15 R139C polymorphism. Materials and methods: All eligible studies published in English up to May 2018 were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Pooled OR and 95% CI were calculated using fixed- or random-effect model. Results: In all, total of 14 studies containing 918 patients and 2,341 controls were included; of these, 8 studies concerned inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 4 concerned acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Overall, the results indicated that the NUDT15 R139C polymorphism was associated with leukopenia induced by thiopurines (OR =9.04, 95% CI 6.05-13.50, P<0.001 for the dominant model; OR =24.26, 95% CI 11.38-51.71, P<0.001 for the recessive model; OR =7.60, 95% CI 4.97-11.61, P<0.001 for the CT vs TT model; OR =38.47, 95% CI 17.78-83.24, P<0.001 for the CC vs TT model). In subgroup analyses, significant associations were found among patients with IBD (OR =7.57, 95% CI 5.16-11.12, P<0.001 for the dominant model), ALL (OR =13.13, 95% CI 3.43-50.23 P<0.001 for the dominant model), and other diseases (OR =31.22, 95% CI 1.20-814.07, P=0.04 for the dominant model). In addition, the R139C variant was strongly associated with early (<8 weeks) (OR =15.53, 95% CI 7.91-30.50, P<0.001 for the dominant model) and late leukopenia (>/=8 weeks) (OR =2.92, 95% CI 2.01-4.24, P<0.001 for the dominant model). Moreover, these findings were sufficiently robust when studies without Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test were excluded. Conclusion: This meta-analysis verified the strong association between the NUDT15 R139C polymorphism and thiopurine-induced leukopenia (both early and late leukopenia) in an Asian population with IBD, ALL, and other diseases. NUDT15 R139C genotyping should be prioritized to predict leukopenia among Asians.","['Liu, Yulan', 'Meng, Yang', 'Wang, Lu', 'Liu, Zhou', 'Li, Jiao', 'Dong, Weiguo']","['Liu Y', 'Meng Y', 'Wang L', 'Liu Z', 'Li J', 'Dong W']",,"['Department of Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology Surgery, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, dwg@whu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, dwg@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6260175,,2018/12/13 06:00,2018/12/13 06:01,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S177007 [doi]', 'ott-11-8309 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Nov 23;11:8309-8317. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S177007. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'IBD', 'NUDT15 R139C', 'leukopenia', 'meta-analysis', 'polymorphism', 'thiopurine']",,,20181123,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early promise of targeted therapy with accelerated approval in the United States in 2000 gave way to fear over increased toxicity in the absence of efficacy, which subsequently resulted in the drug manufacturer voluntarily withdrawing GO from the market in 2010. We outline the history of GO in terms of initial drug development and early clinical trials that ultimately led the way to GO frontline use in AML based on a series of Phase III studies. Among these studies, we discuss the similarities and differences in terms of dosing, frequency, response rates, and toxicities that ultimately led to the re-approval of GO in 2017 based on efficacy, particularly in patients with core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia. Herein, we also review the clinical efficacy of GO in the frontline treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is based on either initial patient high-risk disease or potential co-morbidities that preclude the use of arsenic trioxide (ATO).

Antibodies targeting CD20 protein are being used to treat B-cell malignancies and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. Considering the cost of therapy with innovator monoclonal antibodies for these diseases, development of biosimilar products for the treatment of such diseases provides affordable solution to rising healthcare costs. Materials and Methods: Reference products of rituximab (six batches) were procured and stored as per manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines used in bioassay were procured from American Type Culture Collection and all other reagents used for analysis were of analytical grade. Primary structure was studied by intact mass analysis, peptide fingerprinting, peptide mass fingerprinting and sequence coverage analysis. Higher order structure was studied by circular dichroism, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and disulfide bridge analysis. Different isoforms of reference product and SB-02 were identified using capillary isoelectric focusing and capillary zone electrophoresis. Glycosylation was studied by N-glycan mapping using LC-ESI-MS, point of glycosylation, released glycan analysis using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Product related impurities such as oligomer content analysis and oxidized impurities were studied using size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Results and Conclusion: Here, we report physicochemical and biological characterizations of Sun Pharma's proposed biosimilar (SB-02) to rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. SB-02 and rituximab exhibited indistinguishable primary as well as higher-order structure upon analyzing with the array of analytical and extended characterization methods according to statistical methods. The molecule also displayed comparability to reference product in post-translational modifications and charge heterogeneity. In functional bioassays, SB-02 demonstrated comparable potency with respect to reference product.

Here we identified a signaling pathway-involving the serine-threonine kinase AKT and the transcription factor XBP1s, which regulates unfolded protein response genes(2,3)-that was activated in response to IL-15 in human NK cells. IL-15 induced the phosphorylation of AKT, which led to the deubiquitination, increased stability and nuclear accumulation of XBP1s protein.

XBP1s positively regulated the cytolytic activity of NK cells against leukemia cells and was also required for IL-15-mediated NK cell survival through an anti-apoptotic mechanism. Thus, the newly identified IL-15-AKT-XBP1s signaling pathway contributes to enhanced effector functions and survival of human NK cells.","['Wang, Yufeng', 'Zhang, Yibo', 'Yi, Ping', 'Dong, Wenjuan', 'Nalin, Ansel P', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Zhu, Zheng', 'Chen, Lichao', 'Benson, Don M', 'Mundy-Bosse, Bethany L', 'Freud, Aharon G', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Yu, Jianhua']","['Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yi P', 'Dong W', 'Nalin AP', 'Zhang J', 'Zhu Z', 'Chen L', 'Benson DM', 'Mundy-Bosse BL', 'Freud AG', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Yu J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5673-0203', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0326-3223']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Third Affiliated Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA. jiayu@coh.org.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. jiayu@coh.org.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA. jiayu@coh.org.', 'Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA. jiayu@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI129582/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA185301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS106170/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA199447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA208353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA163205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Unfolded Protein Response', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1/*metabolism']",PMC6293989,['NIHMS1510059'],2018/12/13 06:00,2019/05/23 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41590-018-0265-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41590-018-0265-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2019 Jan;20(1):10-17. doi: 10.1038/s41590-018-0265-1.

Pertinently, the sensitivity of some tumor cell lines to BH3 mimetic ABT737, which targets BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W but not MCL-1, is enhanced by 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). We found that 2DG augmented apoptosis induced by ABT737 in 3 of 8 human hemopoietic tumor cell lines, most strongly in pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line NALM-6, the focus of our mechanistic studies. Although 2DG can lower MCL-1 translation, how it does so is incompletely understood, in part because 2DG inhibits both glycolysis and protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Its glycolysis inhibition lowered ATP and, through the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway, markedly reduced global protein synthesis, as did an ER integrated stress response. A dual reporter assay revealed that 2DG impeded not only cap-dependent translation but also elongation or cap-independent translation. MCL-1 protein fell markedly, whereas 12 other BCL-2 family members were unaffected. We ascribe the MCL-1 drop to the global fall in translation, exacerbated for mRNAs with a structured 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) containing potential regulatory motifs like those in MCL-1 mRNA and the short half-life of MCL-1 protein. Pertinently, 2DG downregulated two other short-lived oncoproteins, MYC and MDM2. Thus, our results support MCL-1 as a critical 2DG target, but also reveal multiple effects on global translation that may well also affect its promotion of apoptosis.","['Tailler, Maximilien', 'Lindqvist, Lisa M', 'Gibson, Leonie', 'Adams, Jerry M']","['Tailler M', 'Lindqvist LM', 'Gibson L', 'Adams JM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2421-2740'],"['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'CSL Ltd, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia. adams@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia. adams@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomimetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",PMC6748140,,2018/12/13 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-018-0244-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-018-0244-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2019 Sep;26(9):1766-1781. doi: 10.1038/s41418-018-0244-y.

AML remains one of the major causes of death in children with cancer and for children with AML relapse is the most common cause of death. Here, by modelling AML in vivo we demonstrate that AML is discriminated by the age of the cell of origin. Young cells give rise to myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype acute leukaemia, whereas adult cells give rise exclusively to AML, with a shorter latency. Unlike adult, young AML cells do not remodel the bone marrow stroma. Transcriptional analysis distinguishes young AML by the upregulation of immune pathways. Analysis of human paediatric AML samples recapitulates a paediatric immune cell interaction gene signature, highlighting two genes, RGS10 and FAM26F as prognostically significant. This work advances our understanding of paediatric AML biology, and provides murine models that offer the potential for developing paediatric specific therapeutic strategies.","['Chaudhury, Shahzya', ""O'Connor, Caitriona"", 'Canete, Ana', 'Bittencourt-Silvestre, Joana', 'Sarrou, Evgenia', 'Prendergast, Aine', 'Choi, Jarny', 'Johnston, Pamela', 'Wells, Christine A', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Keeshan, Karen']","['Chaudhury S', ""O'Connor C"", 'Canete A', 'Bittencourt-Silvestre J', 'Sarrou E', 'Prendergast A', 'Choi J', 'Johnston P', 'Wells CA', 'Gibson B', 'Keeshan K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5500-1690', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2777-4407', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7788-8867', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3133-3628', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7266-0890']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Centre for Stem Cell Systems, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Centre for Stem Cell Systems, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. karen.keeshan@glasgow.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (CALHM6 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (RGS10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pediatrics', 'Prognosis', 'RGS Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6290074,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-07584-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-07584-1 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Dec 11;9(1):5280. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-07584-1.,,,,,,,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How heterozygous GATA2 mutations affect human hematopoietic development or cause characteristic cellular deficiency and eventual hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia is not fully understood. We used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to study hematopoietic development in the setting of GATA2 deficiency. We performed hematopoietic differentiation using iPSC derived from patients with GATA2 deficiency and examined their ability to commit to mesoderm, hemogenic endothelial precursors (HEPs), hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Patient-derived iPSC, either derived from fibroblasts/marrow stromal cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, did not show significant defects in committing to mesoderm, HEP, hematopoietic stem progenitor, or NK cells. However, HEP derived from GATA2-mutant iPSC showed impaired maturation toward hematopoietic lineages. Hematopoietic differentiation was nearly abolished from homozygous GATA2 knockout (KO) iPSC lines and markedly reduced in heterozygous KO lines compared with isogenic controls. On the other hand, correction of the mutated GATA2 allele in patient-specific iPSC did not alter hematopoietic development consistently in our model. GATA2 deficiency usually manifests within the first decade of life. Newborn and infant hematopoiesis appears to be grossly intact; therefore, our iPSC model indeed may resemble the disease phenotype, suggesting that other genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may contribute to bone marrow failure in these patients following birth. However, heterogeneity of PSC-based models and limitations of in vitro differentiation protocol may limit the possibility to detect subtle cellular phenotypes.","['Jung, Moonjung', 'Cordes, Stefan', 'Zou, Jizhong', 'Yu, Shiqin J', 'Guitart, Xavi', 'Hong, So Gun', 'Dang, Vinh', 'Kang, Elaine', 'Donaires, Flavia S', 'Hassan, Sergio A', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Townsley, Danielle', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Winkler, Thomas']","['Jung M', 'Cordes S', 'Zou J', 'Yu SJ', 'Guitart X', 'Hong SG', 'Dang V', 'Kang E', 'Donaires FS', 'Hassan SA', 'Albitar M', 'Hsu AP', 'Holland SM', 'Hickstein DD', 'Townsley D', 'Dunbar CE', 'Winkler T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1364-1814', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6841-2122']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'iPSC Core, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Center for Molecular Modeling, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA.']",['eng'],['UL1 TR001866/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'GATA2 Deficiency/genetics/*pathology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Editing', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",PMC6290105,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018017137 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017137 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Dec 11;2(23):3553-3565. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the activation of this proto-oncogene in tumors. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining showed that FLI1 is aberrantly overexpressed in advanced stage and metastatic breast cancers. Using a CRISPR Cas9-guided immunoprecipitation assay, we identify a circular RNA in the FLI1 promoter chromatin complex, consisting of FLI1 exons 4-2-3, referred to as FECR1.Overexpression of FECR1 enhances invasiveness of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Notably, FECR1 utilizes a positive feedback mechanism to activate FLI1 by inducing DNA hypomethylation in CpG islands of the promoter. FECR1 binds to the FLI1 promoter in cis and recruits TET1, a demethylase that is actively involved in DNA demethylation. FECR1 also binds to and downregulates in trans DNMT1, a methyltransferase that is essential for the maintenance of DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that FECR1 circular RNA acts as an upstream regulator to control breast cancer tumor growth by coordinating the regulation of DNA methylating and demethylating enzymes. Thus, FLI1 drives tumor metastasis not only through the canonical oncoprotein pathway, but also by using epigenetic mechanisms mediated by its exonic circular RNA.","['Chen, Naifei', 'Zhao, Gang', 'Yan, Xu', 'Lv, Zheng', 'Yin, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Shilin', 'Song, Wei', 'Li, Xueli', 'Li, Lingyu', 'Du, Zhonghua', 'Jia, Lin', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Li, Wei', 'Hoffman, Andrew R', 'Hu, Ji-Fan', 'Cui, Jiuwei']","['Chen N', 'Zhao G', 'Yan X', 'Lv Z', 'Yin H', 'Zhang S', 'Song W', 'Li X', 'Li L', 'Du Z', 'Jia L', 'Zhou L', 'Li W', 'Hoffman AR', 'Hu JF', 'Cui J']",,"['Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Breast Cancer Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China. jifan@stanford.edu.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA. jifan@stanford.edu.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 133021, Jilin, China. cuijw@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX002905/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'BX002905/VA/VA/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism']",PMC6290540,,2018/12/13 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13059-018-1594-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-018-1594-y [pii]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2018 Dec 11;19(1):218. doi: 10.1186/s13059-018-1594-y.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer', '*Circular RNA', '*DNA methylation', '*DNMT1', '*FLI1', '*TET1', '*Tumor']",,,20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify prognostic factors and explore the role of haplo-HSCT in the treatment of Ph+ ALL in the TKI era. We analyzed clinical data of Ph+ ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years who received imatinib added to intensive chemotherapy at the start of induction therapy. Among the 68 patients who completed at least 2 consolidation cycles, 44 underwent transplantation (transplant arm) and 24 received continuous TKI with chemotherapy (nontransplant arm). At the 3-year follow-up the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were 23.5%, 73.4%, and 80.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that hematologic response (whether complete remission [CR] was achieved) at the induction end, BCR-ABL levels (whether major molecular response [MMR] was achieved) at 3 months, and transplantation were independent affecting factors for CIR, EFS, and OS. In the risk stratification analysis based on the first 2 prognostic factors mentioned above, no significant difference existed between the transplant and nontransplant arms for the probabilities of 3-year OS, EFS, and CIR in the standard-risk group (no poor prognostic factors). Meanwhile, OS, EFS, and CIR rates were significantly better in the transplant arm in the high-risk group (>/=1 poor prognostic factor). Among the 44 patients in the transplant arm, 37 underwent haplo-HSCT. Achieving CR at the induction end, MMR at 3 months, and haplo-transplant were also independent favorable factors of CIR, EFS, and OS in the nontransplant and haplo-HSCT arms. Haplo-HSCT showed a significant survival advantage in the high-risk group only. Hematologic response at the induction end and BCR-ABL levels at 3 months are likely to be useful for identifying pediatric Ph+ ALL patients at a high risk of relapse in the TKI era. Children with Ph+ ALL in first CR may benefit from allo-HSCT, particularly those at high risk. Haplo-HSCT could achieve good long-term survival for pediatric Ph+ ALL. Thus, haplo-HSCT can be an alternative approach for high-risk Ph+ ALL patients.","['Xue, Yu-Juan', 'Cheng, Yi-Fei', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Wu, Jun', 'Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Suo, Pan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Chen, Huan', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Han, Wei', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Xue YJ', 'Cheng YF', 'Lu AD', 'Wang Y', 'Zuo YX', 'Yan CH', 'Wu J', 'Sun YQ', 'Suo P', 'Chen YH', 'Chen H', 'Jia YP', 'Liu KY', 'Han W', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang LP', 'Huang XJ']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.

To date, population pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have identified several factors that explain in part the large between-patient variability in sirolimus PK. However, within-patient variability in sirolimus PK is not well documented. This study presents examples of model-based PK-guided dosing of sirolimus in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where patients experienced significant changes in sirolimus blood concentrations due to infection and food intake during the treatment period. METHODS: Clinical PK data were obtained as part of a prospective pilot study of sirolimus combined with multiagent chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01658007). A PK model-informed loading dose of 1.8mg/m(2) every 8h was started on the first day of sirolimus treatment. Subsequent doses were adjusted based on concentration measurements the first blood draw scheduled 24h into the regimen on the morning of day 2. Sirolimus blood concentrations were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS assay. All dosing recommendations were generated in real time using the PK model with Bayesian estimation. RESULTS: Three patients were enrolled in this study. Two patients achieved target concentration attainment with the PK model-informed loading dose on day 1 of sirolimus treatment. Subsequent unexpected high sirolimus concentrations were observed in two patients, where patients had flulike symptoms such as fever and cough. A sudden decrease in sirolimus concentrations was observed in one patient after switching sirolimus administration from the fed to the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights within-patient fluctuations in sirolimus concentrations associated with intercurrent infection and with changes in diet. These findings highlight the challenge of maintaining a target sirolimus concentration as a patient's clinical status changes, and the benefit of intensive monitoring of therapeutic drug levels in children treated with sirolimus. Intra-patient alternations in sirolimus PK due to similar disease/food interactions may be relevant in pediatric patients treated with sirolimus for other disease indications.","['Mizuno, Tomoyuki', ""O'Brien, Maureen M"", 'Vinks, Alexander A']","['Mizuno T', ""O'Brien MM"", 'Vinks AA']",,"[""Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

While glucocorticoid efficacy can be largely attributed to lymphocyte-specific apoptosis, its molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we studied genome-wide lymphocyte-specific open chromatin domains (LSOs), and integrated LSOs with glucocorticoid-induced RNA transcription and chromatin modulation using an in vivo patient-derived xenograft model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This led to the identification of LSOs critical for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Glucocorticoid receptor cooperated with CTCF at these LSOs to mediate DNA looping, which was inhibited by increased DNA methylation in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL and non-lymphoid cell types.

HOXB7 is upregulated in tumors and is related to cell proliferation and cell cycle. However, the role of HOXB7 in ALL progression remains unclear. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of HOXB7 in cell viability and cell cycle in ALL cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes was isolated by Isopycnic Ficoll-Hypaque solution; Relative mRNA expression of HOXB7 was measured by RT-qPCR; Relative protein expressions of HOXB7, p27, bFGF, pERK1/2 were tested by Western blot assay; Cell viability was tested by MTT; Cell proliferation was detected by BrdU assay; 2.8. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. KEY FINDINGS: HOXB7 was significantly elevated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with ALL. HOXB7 was inhibited by HOXB7 siRNA transfection; cell viability decreased; and cell cycle was arrested in ALL cell lines. Meanwhile, HOXB7 suppression significantly induced the protein expression of p27 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor). We also demonstrated the molecular mechanism of HOXB7 regulation on p27. HOXB7 suppression obviously inhibited the protein expressions of b basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and p-ERK1/2. Also, the inhibitory effects of HOXB7 suppression on p-ERK1/2, cell viability, and cell cycle in ALL cell lines were markedly reversed after culturing with bFGF (9ng/mL) for 24h. After incubating with bFGF, cells with HOXB7 inhibition were treated with a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98095, after which the effects of bFGF on protein expression of p27, cell viability, and cell cycle were obviously reversed. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that inhibiting HOXB7 suppresses p27-mediated ALL progression by regulating bFGF/ERK1/2.","['Zhong, Yaping', 'Zhang, Yonggang', 'Ma, Dongsheng', 'Ren, Xiaoyan', 'Xu, Chunling', 'Wan, Dingming']","['Zhong Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma D', 'Ren X', 'Xu C', 'Wan D']",,"['Department of hematology, Zhumadian Central Hospital, Zhumadian 463000, Henan, China.

Many different leukocyte subpopulations exist that exert distinct functions. Leukocytes are recruited to sites of inflammation and combat the cause of inflammation via many different effector functions. Virtually all of these processes depend on dynamic actin remodeling allowing leukocytes to adhere, migrate, phagocytose, and release granules. However, actin dynamics are not possible without actin-binding proteins (ABP) that orchestrate the balance between actin polymerization, branching, and depolymerization. The homologue of the ubiquitous ABP cortactin in hematopoietic cells is hematopoietic cell-specific lyn substrate-1, often called hematopoietic cell-specific protein-1 (HCLS1 or HS1). HS1 has been reported in different leukocytes to regulate Arp2/3-dependent migration. However, more evidence is emerging that HS1 functions go far beyond just being a direct actin modulator. For example, HS1 is important for the activation of GTPases and integrins, and mediates signaling downstream of many receptors including BCR, TCR, and CXCR4. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on HS1 functions and discuss them in a pathophysiologic context.","['Castro-Ochoa, Karla F', 'Guerrero-Fonseca, Idaira M', 'Schnoor, Michael']","['Castro-Ochoa KF', 'Guerrero-Fonseca IM', 'Schnoor M']",,"['Department of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CTTN protein, human)', '0 (Cortactin)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex/*genetics/immunology', 'Actins/*genetics/immunology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cortactin/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/*genetics/immunology']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.MR0618-212R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 May;105(5):881-890. doi: 10.1002/JLB.MR0618-212R.

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to better analyze correlations between GST polymorphisms and hematological malignancy. METHODS: Literature retrieve was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies were enrolled for analyses. Significant associations with hematological malignancy were observed for GSTM1 (P < 0.0001, OR = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.14-1.38), GSTP1 (P = 0.002, OR = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.07-1.34), and GSTT1 (P < 0.0001, OR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.39-1.76) polymorphisms in overall analyses. Further subgroup analyses by ethnicity revealed that GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms were both significantly correlated with hematological malignancy in Caucasians, East Asians, and West Asians, whereas GSTP1 polymorphism was only significantly correlated with hematological malignancy in Caucasians and West Asians. When we stratified data according to type of disease, positive results were found for all investigated polymorphisms in patients with certain types of acute leukemia. Moreover, GSTP1 polymorphism was also found to be significantly associated with chronic leukemia and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms may serve as potential genetic biomarkers of hematological malignancy in certain ethnicities.","['Li, Minjie', 'Zheng, Meifang', 'Chen, Hongyun', 'Yu, Haiqing']","['Li M', 'Zheng M', 'Chen H', 'Yu H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6497-4133'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Linyi Cancer Hospital, Linyi, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Linyi Cancer Hospital, Linyi, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Linyi Cancer Hospital, Linyi, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Linyi Cancer Hospital, Linyi, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.28145 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec 9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28145.,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['gene polymorphisms', 'glutathione S-transferases (GST)', 'hematological malignancy', 'meta-analysis']",,,20181209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mutation has functional effects in various haematological malignancies but its role in CLL remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that MYD88 L265P mutations are associated with mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGHV-M) status and that among IGHV-M patients, the presence of MYD88 L265P is associated with younger age at diagnosis. Using microarray and RNA-Seq gene expression analysis, we further observe that the MYD88 L265P mutation is associated with a distinctive gene expression signature that predicts both failure-free survival and overall survival. This association was validated in an independent cohort of patients. To determine whether MYD88 L265P mutations can be therapeutically exploited in CLL, we treated primary cells with an inhibitor of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), a critical effector of the MYD88 pathway. IRAK4 inhibition decreased downstream nuclear factor-kappaB signalling and cell viability in CLL cells, indicating the potential of the MYD88 pathway as a therapeutic target in CLL.","['Improgo, Ma Reina', 'Tesar, Bethany', 'Klitgaard, Josephine L', 'Magori-Cohen, Reuma', 'Yu, Lijian', 'Kasar, Siddha', 'Chaudhary, Divya', 'Miao, Wenyan', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Hoang, Kevin', 'Westlin, William F', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Improgo MR', 'Tesar B', 'Klitgaard JL', 'Magori-Cohen R', 'Yu L', 'Kasar S', 'Chaudhary D', 'Miao W', 'Fernandes SM', 'Hoang K', 'Westlin WF', 'Kim HT', 'Brown JR']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2040-4961'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15714 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Mar;184(6):925-936. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15714.

The incidence of Bacillus bloodstream infections and characteristics of infection among children with cancer or indication for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of all cases of Bacillus bacteremia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital. We report average incidences from 2012 to 2014. We performed a detailed review of infections among children with cancer or undergoing HCT and a case-control study to evaluate whether neutropenia at diagnosis caries higher risk of Bacillus infection for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: One hundred fourteen children developed Bacillus bacteremia during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 0.27/1,000 patients. Among children treated for cancer or undergoing HCT, there were 37 bloodstream infections (2.0/1,000 patients). Of the 37 oncology/HCT patients, oncologic diagnoses included ALL (18), acute myeloid leukemia (3), myelodysplastic syndrome (1), solid tumors (8), and 7 children were undergoing HCT. The incidence of infection among children with ALL was 34/1,000 patients and all central nervous system (CNS) infections (6) and deaths (3) occurred in this population. Neutropenia at time of diagnosis in children with ALL was not associated with risk of infection (P = 0.17). DISCUSSION: We report the first hospital-wide analysis of Bacillus infection and found that immunocompromised children experience a significant proportion of Bacillus infections. Children with ALL have a high incidence of infection and are at higher risk of CNS involvement and death.","['Shulman, David S', 'Mehrotra, Preeti', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Capraro, Andrew', 'Lehmann, Leslie E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Surana, Neeraj K', 'Place, Andrew E']","['Shulman DS', 'Mehrotra P', 'Blonquist TM', 'Capraro A', 'Lehmann LE', 'Silverman LB', 'Surana NK', 'Place AE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5994-2604', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9604-4213']","[""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Emergency Medicine, Business Intelligence, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],['K08 AI108690/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bacillus', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC6664817,['NIHMS1043518'],2018/12/12 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27568 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Apr;66(4):e27568. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27568.

Functional HSP90 is required for the stability of AKT, a serine-threonine kinase phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation. AKT plays a crucial regulatory role in differentiation, cell cycle, transcription, translation, metabolism and apoptosis. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of the promyelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARA) fusion protein, which deregulates expression of several genes involved in differentiation and apoptosis. Here, we report inhibition of HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 isomer transcription in blasts isolated from patients with APL, associated with reduction of HSP90 protein expression and loss of control on AKT protein phosphorylation. We show that in vitro treatment of PML/RARA expressing cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulates HSP90 expression and stabilizes AKT. Addition of the HSP90-inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in combination with ATRA, blocks upregulation of AKT protein, indicating that HSP90 is necessary for ATRA action on AKT. This is the first report proving that expression of HSP90 isomers are directly and differentially repressed by PML/RARA, with critical results on cellular homeostasis of target proteins, such as AKT, in APL blasts.","['Piredda, Maria Liliana', 'Gaur, Girish', 'Catalano, Gianfranco', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Banella, Cristina', 'Travaglini, Serena', 'Puzzangara, Maria Carmen', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Noguera, Nelida Ines']","['Piredda ML', 'Gaur G', 'Catalano G', 'Divona M', 'Banella C', 'Travaglini S', 'Puzzangara MC', 'Voso MT', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Noguera NI']",,"['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Policlinico Tor vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90AA1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP90AB1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15715 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Mar;184(6):937-948. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15715.

The current study investigated the effects of CT on the endometrium receptivity by morphological study and evaluation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), mucin 1 (Muc-1), and microRNA (miRNA) Let-7a in the ovarian stimulation and the normal ovarian cycle. Then the mechanism of the CT effects through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was studied by using PP242. A total of 64 BALB/c mice were divided into the normal ovarian cycle and ovarian stimulation groups. Each group consisted of four subgroups: control, calcitonin, PP242, and calcitonin+PP242. CT and PP242 were injected on the fourth of pregnancy into the mice and 24 hr later all the mice were killed. The uterine tissue samples were used for morphological analysis, and endometrial cells were mechanically isolated for evaluation of gene and protein expression. The results showed that ovarian stimulation induced mTOR phosphorylation as well as increased expression of the Let-7a miRNA. In addition, CT injection increased the expression of LIF and miRNA Let-7a in ovarian stimulation similar to that in normal ovarian cycles. However, injection of PP242 reduced expression of miRNA Let-7a and increased Muc-1 expression in ovarian stimulation group. In conclusion, the administration of CT improved endometrial receptivity in mice. This phenomenon occurred by upregulation of LIF, miRNA Let-7a and downregulation of Muc-1 via mTOR signaling pathway.","['Shokrzadeh, Naser', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Abedelahi, Ali', 'Hessam Shariati, Mohammad B', 'Niknafs, Behrooz']","['Shokrzadeh N', 'Alivand MR', 'Abedelahi A', 'Hessam Shariati MB', 'Niknafs B']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8816-2797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5847-3594']","['Immunology Research Center, Faculty of medicine, Tabriz University Of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (muc1 protein, mouse)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitonin/*pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Mucin-1/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27969 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):12989-13000. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27969.

However, single-cell analysis often requires the use of fluorescent tags and cell lysis followed by genomic profiling to identify the cellular heterogeneity. Identifying individual cells in a noninvasive and label-free manner is crucial for the detection of energy metabolism which will discriminate cell types and most importantly critical for maintaining cell viability for further analysis. Here, we have developed a robust assay using the droplet microfluidic technology together with the phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to study cell heterogeneity within and among the leukemia cell lines (K-562 and Jurkat). We have extended these techniques to characterize metabolic differences between proliferating and quiescent cells-a critical step toward label-free single cancer cell dormancy research.

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC CD25 expression, and presence of KITD816V mutation. RISK STRATIFICATION: Establishing SM subtype as per the World Health Organization classification system is an important first step. Broadly, patients either have indolent/smoldering SM (ISM/SSM) or advanced SM, the latter includes aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Identification of poor-risk mutations (ie, ASXL1, RUNX1, SRSF2, NRAS) further refines the risk stratification. Recently, clinical and hybrid clinical-molecular risk models have been developed to more accurately assign prognosis in SM patients. MANAGEMENT: ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and treatment is generally limited to anaphylaxis prevention/symptom control/osteoporosis treatment. Patients with advanced SM frequently need MC cytoreductive therapy to ameliorate disease-related organ dysfunction. High response rates have been seen with small-molecule inhibitors that target mutant-KIT, including midostaurin (Food and Drug Administration approved) or avapritinib (investigational). Other options for MC cytoreduction include cladribine or interferon-alpha, although head-to-head comparisons are lacking. Treatment of SM-AHN primarily targets the AHN component, if an aggressive disease such as acute myeloid leukemia is present. Allogeneic stem cell transplant can be considered in such patients, or in those with relapsed/refractory advanced SM. Imatinib has a limited therapeutic role in SM; effective cytoreduction is limited to those with imatinib-sensitive KIT mutations.","['Pardanani, Animesh']",['Pardanani A'],,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', '*Disease Management', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/classification/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tryptases/blood/genetics']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/12/27 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25371 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Mar;94(3):363-377. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25371.

The current analysis was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of decitabine in pediatric patients with AML and evaluate their consistency with the PK in adult patients. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed by pooling decitabine concentration-time data from 5 adult (AML and MDS) and 2 pediatric (AML) studies. A total of 840 concentration-time data points obtained from 71 adults and 28 pediatric subjects (1 to 16 years old) were available for analysis. A 2-compartment linear pharmacokinetic (PK) model with allometric scaling using body surface area accounting for body size adequately described the PK of decitabine. After accounting for body size, decitabine pharmacokinetics were not affected by age, sex, race, dosing regimen, renal function (creatinine clearance), bilirubin, or disease type (AML or MDS) and all PK parameters (including clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, maximum concentration, time to reach maximal concentration, and terminal half-life) were comparable between adult and pediatric patients. Simulated concentration-time profiles using the final population PK model suggested that decitabine exposure at steady state was similar in adults and pediatrics for a 20 mg/m(2) decitabine dose administered as a 1-hour infusion once daily. The current analysis suggests that decitabine PK is similar in pediatric AML patients and a combined adult AML and MDS population.","['Zhou, Wangda', 'Parasrampuria, Dolly A', 'Nemat, Sepideh', 'Nakahara, Susumu', 'Poggesi, Italo', 'Massarella, Joseph', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Appiani, Carlos']","['Zhou W', 'Parasrampuria DA', 'Nemat S', 'Nakahara S', 'Poggesi I', 'Massarella J', 'Zhang L', 'Appiani C']",,"['Global Clinical Pharmacology, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Global Clinical Pharmacology, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Established Products, Janssen Research & Development UK, High Wycombe, UK.', 'Established Products, Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Global Clinical Pharmacology, Janssen Research & Development, Cologno Monzese, Italy.', 'Global Clinical Pharmacology, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Global Clinical Pharmacology, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Established Products, Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decitabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1357 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 May;59(5):668-676. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1357.

As a crucial circadian agent, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is widely recognized as a promising predictor of clinical outcome in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the understanding of its influence on AML is insufficient. Using KD cells and expression assays, we carried out detailed investigation of the role of NPAS2 in AML in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, we found that NPAS2 expression was elevated in AML cells both in vivo and in vitro. NPAS2 knockdown via lentiviral infection clearly suppressed proliferation of MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells. Additionally, NPAS2 knockdown caused G1/S cell cycle arrest (CCA), which inhibited CDC25A expression. Moreover, NPAS2 knockdown promoted cell death, as evidenced by increased caspase-3 cleavage, and change in Bcl2/Bax production. Excessive CDC25A expression eliminated G1/S CCA triggered by NPAS2 knockdown and death of NPAS2 knocked down MOLM and MV4-11 cells. The expression of CDC25A was stabilized by NPAS2, which induced cell cycle progression and participated in suppression of cell death by modulating caspase-3 cleavage, and expression of Bcl2/Bax. We therefore indicated NPAS2 to be a crucial modulator of survival as well as proliferation. Our research sheds light on the etiology of the proliferation of promyelocytes modulated via NPAS2 with regard to AML.","['Song, Bin', 'Chen, Yan', 'Liu, Yuhong', 'Wan, Chucheng', 'Zhang, Longjin', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Song B', 'Chen Y', 'Liu Y', 'Wan C', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8091-0471'],"[""Department of Hematology, Af fi liated Taihe Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Shiyan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Af fi liated Taihe Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Shiyan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Af fi liated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Af fi liated Taihe Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Shiyan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Af fi liated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Af fi liated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['81270596/Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.28160 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec 9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28160.,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CDC25A', 'NPAS2', 'cell cycle', 'cell death', 'proliferation']",,,20181209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were pooled from three clinical studies including 250 patients (n = 2743) who received inotuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy. Patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (NCT01564784 and NCT01363297) received 1.8 mg m(-2) per cycle in divided doses (mean Cmax 371 ng ml(-1) ; considered therapeutic) and patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT00868608) received 1.8 mg m(-2) per cycle as a single dose (mean Cmax 569 ng ml(-1) ; considered supratherapeutic). Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms were performed at baseline and predefined time points postdose with paired pharmacokinetic collections. The exposure-response relationship between corrected QT interval (QTc: QT interval corrected using population-specific formula [QTcS] or QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) and inotuzumab ozogamicin concentration was characterized using a linear mixed-effects model, and simulations were performed using the final validated model. Full model development involved testing for covariates that may account for part of the identified variability. RESULTS: QTc intervals had a small but positive correlation with inotuzumab ozogamicin concentration. Based on 1000 simulations, median (upper 95% CI) QTcS and QTcF changes from baseline were <10 ms at both therapeutic (2.70 ms [5.40 ms] and 2.53 ms [4.92 ms], respectively) and supratherapeutic (4.14 ms [8.28 ms] and 3.87 ms [7.54 ms], respectively) concentrations.

This study aimed to determine the expression, clinical significance, and possible biological function of a novel lncRNA LINC00265 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of LINC00265 were systematically evaluated in TCGA datasets. RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression level of LINC00265 in bone marrow and serum obtained from AML patients and healthy controls. The clinical data were interpreted by x2 test, Kaplan-Meier analyses, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. The functional role of LINC00265 was verified using cell experiments. Western blotting was used to examine the modulatory effect of LINC00265 on AKT/PI3K pathway in AML. RESULTS: LINC00265 was significantly highly expressed in the bone marrow and serum of AML patients. High serum LINC00265 was significantly associated with FAB classification and cytogenetics. ROC analyses showed that serum LINC00265 levels were reliable in distinguishing patients with AML from normal controls. Clinical assay indicated that AML patients with higher serum LINC00265 expression suffered poorer overall survival. Functionally, overexpression of LINC00265 suppressed the capability of proliferation, migration and invasion in AML cell lines. By using Western blot, we further illustrated that LINC00265 activated PI3K/AKT signaling in AML cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only demonstrated that LINC00265 contributes to AML proliferation, migration and invasion via modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling, but also suggested the potential value of LINC00265 as a clinical prognostic and a diagnostic marker for AML.","['Ma, L', 'Kuai, W-X', 'Sun, X-Z', 'Lu, X-C', 'Yuan, Y-F']","['Ma L', 'Kuai WX', 'Sun XZ', 'Lu XC', 'Yuan YF']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China. mma33166@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/blood/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201811_16412 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Nov;22(22):7867-7876. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201811_16412.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies of prednisone induced test in evaluating the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia were electronically searched from January 1990 to November 2016 using Pubmed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WanFang, VIP, and CNKI database. Two independent researchers browsed literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMen 5.3 software. A total of 17 articles were included. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that after complete prednisone induced test in children, 5y-EFS, 8y-EFS adverse reactions, persistent remission and relapse were statistically significant differences between the prednisone good response (PGR) and prednisone poor response (PPR).

We retrospectively examined 127 patients [acute myeloid leukemia (n = 48), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 25), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 54)] with DIC, who were diagnosed according to Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare criteria and treated with SPIs [FOY (n = 55) and FUT (n = 72)] at our hospital from 2006 to 2015. The DIC resolution rates on days 7 and 14 were 42.6% and 62.4%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in DIC resolution rates between the FUT and FOY groups [40.3% vs. 45.5% (day 7), P = 0.586; 56.3% vs. 69.8% (day 14), P = 0.179, respectively]. Multivariate analysis revealed that response to chemotherapy was the only independent predictor of DIC resolution on days 7 and 14 (ORR 2.81, 95% CI 1.32-5.98, P = 0.007; ORR 2.51, 95% CI 1.12-5.65, P = 0.026). Resolution of DIC was correlated with improvement of background hematological malignancies, and no significant differences were observed between the two SPIs.","['Minakata, Daisuke', 'Fujiwara,

Yinishu, a generic dasatinib made in China, was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration in 2013 and it costs much less than the patented dasatinib SPRYCEL. The present study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of Yinishu as a second-line treatment for CML by comparing the baseline clinical characteristics, rates of adverse events and efficacy between Yinishu and SPRYCEL groups. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the rates of optimal response between Yinishu and SPRYCEL for patients who started second-line treatment because of treatment failure. For patients who started second-line treatment because of intolerance of first-line treatment, their levels of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 on the international scale (BCR-ABL(IS)) was maintained very low throughout the course of Yinishu treatment. Drug-related adverse events occurred with the same frequency in these two groups. It was confirmed that Yinishu was effective and safe as a secondline treatment for CML patients. Yinishu may be more suitable for patients who are economically unable to pay for the patented dasatinib SPRYCEL.","['Chen, Li-Feng', 'Yuan, Guo-Lin', 'Zhong, Zhao-Dong', 'Zou, Ping', 'Li, Deng-Ju', 'Bao, Yin', 'Ren, Hong-Bo', 'Meng, Li', 'Li, Wei-Ming']","['Chen LF', 'Yuan GL', 'Zhong ZD', 'Zou P', 'Li DJ', 'Bao Y', 'Ren HB', 'Meng L', 'Li WM']",,"['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Xiangyang, 441000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Xiangyang, 441000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, Jingzhou, 434000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. mengli@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. lee937@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",China,Curr Med Sci,Current medical science,101729993,"['0 (Drugs, Generic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drugs, Generic/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11596-018-1976-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-018-1976-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Sci. 2018 Dec;38(6):1005-1011. doi: 10.1007/s11596-018-1976-0.

Recently, novel targeted therapies have been developed to increase response rates and reduce toxicity, especially in high-risk disease. Current goals of CLL therapies are to produce deep and durable, especially minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative, remissions so as to allow patients to ultimately discontinue treatment for a while. Whether this can be achieved with single agents or combination regimens is being investigated. Here, we comment on what the results of recent and ongoing clinical trials mean for the future of CLL therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Large trials have proven the efficacy of novel therapies including small-molecule inhibitors like ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax. These agents are approved as monotherapy for first-line treatment and/or in the relapsed/refractory setting. However, it appears that combining these drugs with other novel agents or with chemoimmunotherapy can give higher rates of MRD-negative remission, and delay disease resistance. Chimeric antigen receptor-T cells may change the outlook for patients with heavily refractory CLL. Further research will determine which drug combinations are optimal for the various subgroups of CLL patients.","['Khan, Maliha', 'Siddiqi, Tanya']","['Khan M', 'Siddiqi T']",,"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Arkansas Medical Center, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

We assessed the prevalence and correlates of pain in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AL. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AL admitted to a comprehensive cancer center completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), which assesses prevalence, severity, and distress associated with pain and other symptoms. Factors associated with severe pain were assessed using logistic regression. Two raters completed chart reviews in duplicate for patients with severe pain (MSAS severity >/= 3/4) to determine the site of pain. RESULTS: Three hundred eighteen patients were recruited from January 2008 to October 2013: 245 (77.0%) had acute myeloid or acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML/APL) and 73 (23.0%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 289 (90.9%) were newly diagnosed and 29 (9.1%) had relapsed disease. Pain was reported in 156/318 (49.2%), of whom 55/156 (35.3%) reported severe pain (>/= 3/4). Pain was associated with all psychological symptoms (all p < 0.005) and some physical symptoms. Severe pain was associated with younger age (p = 0.02), worse performance status (p = 0.04), ALL diagnosis (p = 0.04), and time from onset of chemotherapy (p = 0.03), with pain peaking at 4 weeks after chemotherapy initiation. The most common sites of severe pain were oropharynx (22; 40%), head (12; 21.8%), and abdomen (11; 20%). Only 3 patients (0.9%) were referred to the symptom control/palliative care team during the month prior to or following assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Pain is frequent, distressing, and predictable in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for AL. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of early supportive care in this population.","['Shaulov, Adir', 'Rodin, Gary', 'Popovic, Gordana', 'Caraiscos, Valerie B', 'Le, Lisa W', 'Rydall, Anne', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Zimmermann, Camilla']","['Shaulov A', 'Rodin G', 'Popovic G', 'Caraiscos VB', 'Le LW', 'Rydall A', 'Schimmer AD', 'Zimmermann C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4889-0244'],"['Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Freeman Centre for the Advancement of Palliative Care, North York General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., 16-712, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada. camilla.zimmermann@uhn.ca.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. camilla.zimmermann@uhn.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. camilla.zimmermann@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['84317/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', '702603/Canadian Cancer Society', 'NA/Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation', 'NA/Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care']",['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Pain/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/09/03 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-018-4583-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-018-4583-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Aug;27(8):2789-2797. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4583-5.

The impact of this outcome on health-related quality of life (HRQL) is uncertain and so formed the basis for the investigation reported here. METHODS: This study examined the association between self-reported HRQL and measured height in a cohort (n = 75) of survivors of ALL more than 10 years from diagnosis. HRQL was expressed as utility scores generated from a multi-attribute preference-based measure, the Health Utilities Index (HUI) which includes the complementary systems HUI2 and HUI3. For single attributes the range is from 1.00 (no limitations) to 0.00 (lowest level of function). For overall HRQL the range is 1.00 (perfect health) to 0.00 (equivalent to being dead). A negative score is associated with states of health worse than being dead. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in overall HRQL between subjects <25th (n = 16, 21%), 15th (n = 11, 15%) and 10th (n = 10, 13%) centiles. A greater amount of emotional morbidity, focused on anger and depression, was manifest in those <25th and 15th centiles, with clinically important differences of 0.07 (p = 0.03) and 0.077 (p = 0.016) respectively, but not in the shortest group who were < 10th centile. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in large cohorts of young adults in the general population has reported an inconsistent relationship between height and HRQL. Results from the current study suggest that no such relationship exists in long-term survivors of ALL in childhood and adolescence.","['Collins, Laura', 'Athale, Uma', 'Cranston, Amy', 'Barr, Ronald']","['Collins L', 'Athale U', 'Cranston A', 'Barr R']",,"[""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Room 3N27, Health Sciences Centre, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4J9, Canada.', ""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Room 3N27, Health Sciences Centre, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4J9, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,J Patient Rep Outcomes,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,101722688,,,,PMC6286289,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:01,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41687-018-0084-z [doi]', '10.1186/s41687-018-0084-z [pii]']",epublish,J Patient Rep Outcomes. 2018 Dec 7;2(1):59. doi: 10.1186/s41687-018-0084-z.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Short stature', 'Survivors']",,,20181207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen samples were issued to participating laboratories in two EQA rounds. In the first round, 19 laboratories from 11 European countries analyzing JAK2 V617F as part of their routine diagnostics returned results from in-house assays. In the second round, 25 laboratories from 17 countries participated. Despite variations in starting material, assay set-up and instrumentation the laboratories were generally well aligned in the EQA program.

Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel therapeutic modalities. Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the treatment of relapsed ALL. It has been indicated that Wnt pathway is potentially associated with leukemia recurrence. In the current study, a vincristine (VCR)resistant variant of the human ALL cell line BALL1 (BALL1/VCR) that also had relatively specific resistance to both doxorubicin and etoposide was generated. Overactivation of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway was observed in BALL1/VCR cells, whereas Dickkopfrelated protein 1 selectively suppressed the Wnt signaling pathway and sensitized the response of BALL1/VCR to anticancer agents. In addition, prednisolone exposure in combination with Wnt inhibition restored chemosensitivity in relapsed ALL blasts. Since the resistance of BALL1/VCR cells is potentially attributed to the overexpression of MDRassociated protein 1 (MRP1), the development of drug resistance in relapsed ALL may associated with the overexpression of MRP1 and Pglycoprotein. The results of this study demonstrated that, as a potential candidate to mimic relapsed ALL, BALL1/VCR could be used in further research, while Wntinhibition may become a promising therapeutic approach for treating ALL.","['Fu, Jinqiu', 'Si, Libo', 'Zhuang, Yong', 'Zhang, Aijun', 'Sun, Nianzheng', 'Li, Dong', 'Hao, Bin', 'Ju, Xiuli']","['Fu J', 'Si L', 'Zhuang Y', 'Zhang A', 'Sun N', 'Li D', 'Hao B', 'Ju X']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

The present study aimed to determine the prognostic value of ABAT in 152 patients with MDS, 29 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 40 controls, by detecting the expression and methylation levels of the ABAT gene. In patients with MDS, the expression levels of ABAT were significantly reduced compared with in the controls (P<0.0001), and the degree of DNA methylation was increased in MDS subjects (P<0.0001). Age, hemoglobin level, marrow blasts, International Prognostic Scoring System karyotype, and the expression and methylation levels of ABAT were associated with overall survival (OS), as determined by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, higher marrow blasts and higher methylation percentage were independent risk factors for OS. In addition, a functional study demonstrated that ABAT gene silencing increased cell apoptosis and blocked the G1/S phase in SKM1 and THP1 human leukemia cells. A gammaaminobutyrate aminotransferase inhibitor also blocked the G1/S phase; however, it had no effect on cell apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that ABAT methylation served an essential role in the progression of MDS and therefore may be considered an indicator of poor prognosis for hematological malignancies.","['Zhao, Guangjie', 'Li, Nianyi', 'Li, Shuang', 'Wu, Wanling', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Gu, Jingwen']","['Zhao G', 'Li N', 'Li S', 'Wu W', 'Wang X', 'Gu J']",,"['Department of Haematology, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, P.R.

Elevation of Cyr61 protein levels contributes to the proliferation, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance of malignant cells. Previously, it was discovered that Cyr61 is elevated in both the plasma and the bone marrow supernatants of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), promoting ALL cell survival. However, the role of Cyr61 in the chemotherapeutic resistance of ALL cells remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of Cyr61 in regulating ALL cell chemosensitivity to AraC. It was found that Cyr61 is overexpressed in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with ALL. Increased Cyr61 effectively decreased AraCinduced apoptosis of ALL cells, and its function was blocked by the use of the antiCyr61 monoclonal antibody 093G9. Furthermore, Cyr61 increased the level of Bcl2 in AraCtreated ALL cells. Mechanistically, it was shown that Cyr61 affected ALL cell resistance to AraC partially via the NFkappaB pathway. Taken together, the present study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to reveal that Cyr61 is involved in ALL cell resistance through the NFkappaB pathway. The findings support a functional role for Cyr61 in promoting chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that targeting Cyr61 directly or its relevant effector pathways may improve the clinical responses of patients with ALL.","['Cao, Yingping', 'Wu, Conglian', 'Song, Yanfang', 'Lin, Zhen', 'Kang, Yanli', 'Lu, Pingxia', 'Zhang, Chenqing', 'Huang, Qinghua', 'Hao, Taisen', 'Zhu, Xianjin', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Cao Y', 'Wu C', 'Song Y', 'Lin Z', 'Kang Y', 'Lu P', 'Zhang C', 'Huang Q', 'Hao T', 'Zhu X', 'Hu J']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

The use of cryo-protective agents (CPAs) such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, or trehalose is paramount to reducing cellular cryo-injury, but their effectiveness is still limited. The current study focuses on establishing and modulating the proteomic and the corresponding biological profiles associated with the cryo-injury of human leukemia (HL-60) cells cryopreserved in DMSO alone or DMSO +/- novel CPAs (e.g., nigerose [Nig] or salidroside [Sal]). FINDINGS: To reduce cryo-damage, HL-60 cells were cultured prior and post cryopreservation in malondialdehyde Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium-1640 media +/- Nig or Sal. Shotgun proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in the levels of proteins in cells cryopreserved in Nig or Sal compared to DMSO. Nig mostly affected cellular metabolism and energy pathways, whereas Sal increased the levels of proteins associated with DNA repair/duplication, RNA transcription, and cell proliferation. Validation testing showed that the proteome profile associated with Sal was correlated with a 2.8-fold increase in cell proliferative rate. At the functional level, both Nig and Sal increased glutathione reductase (0.0012+/-6.19E-05 and 0.0016+/-3.04E-05 mU/mL, respectively) compared to DMSO controls (0.0003+/-3.7E-05 mU/mL) and reduced cytotoxicity by decreasing lactate dehydrogenase activities (from -2.5 to -4.75 fold) and lipid oxidation (-1.6 fold). In contrast, only Nig attenuated protein carbonylation or oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified key molecules and corresponding functional pathways underpinning the effect of cryopreservation (+/- CPAs) of HL-60 cells. We also validated the proteomic findings by identifying the corresponding biological profiles associated with promoting an anti-oxidative environment post cryopreservation. Nig or Sal in comparison to DMSO showed differential or additive effects in regard to reducing cryo-injury and enhancing cell survival/proliferation post thaw. These results can provide useful insight to cryo-damage and the design of enhanced cryomedia formulation.","['Al-Otaibi, Noha A S', 'Cassoli, Juliana S', 'Martins-de-Souza, Daniel', 'Slater, Nigel K H', 'Rahmoune, Hassan']","['Al-Otaibi NAS', 'Cassoli JS', 'Martins-de-Souza D', 'Slater NKH', 'Rahmoune H']",,"['Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Philippa Fawcett Drive, Cambridge CB3 0AS, United Kingdom.', 'King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, P.O Box 6086, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia.', 'Laboratory of Neuroproteomics, Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Neuroproteomics, Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Philippa Fawcett Drive, Cambridge CB3 0AS, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Philippa Fawcett Drive, Cambridge CB3 0AS, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gigascience,GigaScience,101596872,"['0 (Cryoprotective Agents)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Proteome)', '0WN3D69UW4 (laminaribiose)', 'M983H6N1S9 (rhodioloside)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cryopreservation', 'Cryoprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Disaccharides/pharmacology', 'Glucosides/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Protein Carbonylation/drug effects', 'Proteome/metabolism', '*Proteomics']",PMC6394207,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5237707 [pii]', '10.1093/gigascience/giy155 [doi]']",ppublish,Gigascience. 2019 Mar 1;8(3). pii: 5237707. doi: 10.1093/gigascience/giy155.,['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Carriers are phenotypically normal and are often diagnosed because of recurrent miscarriages, infertility, or aneuploid offspring. Mortality and site-specific cancer risks in carriers have not been prospectively investigated. We followed 1,987 carriers diagnosed in Great Britain for deaths and cancer risk, over an average of 24.1 years. Standardized mortality and incidence ratios were calculated comparing the number of observed events against population rates. Overall mortality was higher for carriers diagnosed before age 15 years (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 3.35), similar for those diagnosed aged 15-44 years (SMR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.86-1.28), and lower for those diagnosed aged 45-84 years (SMR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.95). Cancer incidence was higher for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.24) and childhood leukemia (SIR = 14.5, 95% CI: 1.75, 52.2), the latter particularly in rob(15;21) carriers (SIR = 447.8, 95% CI: 11.3, 2,495). Rob(13;14) carriers had a higher breast cancer risk (SIR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.15). Mortality risks relative to the population in diagnosed carriers depend on age at cytogenetic diagnosis, possibly reflecting age-specific cytogenetic referral reasons. Carriers might be at greater risk of childhood leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and those diagnosed with rob(13;14) of breast cancer.","['Schoemaker, Minouk J', 'Jones, Michael E', 'Higgins, Craig D', 'Wright, Alan F', 'Swerdlow, Anthony J']","['Schoemaker MJ', 'Jones ME', 'Higgins CD', 'Wright AF', 'Swerdlow AJ']",,"['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Medical Research Council Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Breast Cancer Research, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['0 (Protein Translocation Systems)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/genetics/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality', 'Protein Translocation Systems/*analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6395160,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/12/25 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5233452 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwy266 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2019 Mar 1;188(3):500-508. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwy266.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

We here show that cytidine (Cyd) with ssRNA also activated TLR8 in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and a myeloid cell line U937, but not in an embryonic kidney cell line 293T. Cyd deaminase (CDA), an enzyme highly expressed in leukocytes, deaminates Cyd to Uri. CDA expression enabled TLR8 response to Cyd and ssRNA in 293T cells. CDA deficiency and a CDA inhibitor both reduced TLR8 responses to Cyd and ssRNA in U937. The CDA inhibitor also reduced PBL response to Cyd and ssRNA. A Cyd analogue, azacytidine, is used for the therapy of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Azacytidine with ssRNA induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in U937 and PBLs in a manner dependent on CDA and TLR8. These results suggest that CDA enables TLR8 activation by Cyd or its analogues with ssRNA through deaminating activity. Nucleoside metabolism might impact TLR8 responses in a variety of situations such as the treatment with nucleoside analogues.","['Furusho, Katsuhiro', 'Shibata, Takuma', 'Sato, Ryota', 'Fukui, Ryutaro', 'Motoi, Yuji', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Saitoh, Shin-Ichiroh', 'Ichinohe, Takeshi', 'Moriyama, Masafumi', 'Nakamura, Seiji', 'Miyake, Kensuke']","['Furusho K', 'Shibata T', 'Sato R', 'Fukui R', 'Motoi Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Saitoh SI', 'Ichinohe T', 'Moriyama M', 'Nakamura S', 'Miyake K']",,"['Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Oral and Maxillofacial Oncology, Division of Maxillofacial Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Viral Infection, Department of Infectious Disease Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Oral and Maxillofacial Oncology, Division of Maxillofacial Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Section of Oral and Maxillofacial Oncology, Division of Maxillofacial Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5237423 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxy075 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2019 Mar 5;31(3):167-173. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxy075.,"['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2018.

METHODS: We identified retrospectively those cultures with Cryptococcus sp. growth, and then obtained their clinical files which were analyzed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: We were able to obtain data from 13 of 15 patients who presented with Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Out of all, 11 (84.6%) were males, with a median age of 35 years old. 11 (84,6%) were HIV positive, 1 (7,7%) had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 1 (7,7%) refered alcohol abuse. Out of the 15 episodes, 9 (60%) had meningeal infection; 5 (33.3%) were cryptococcemia without meningeal involvement and 1 (6.6%) presented as a pulmonary infection. Eight patients were deceased at one year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcus sp. infection must be suspected in patients with cellular immunodeficiencies. Meningeal involvement is the most frequent form of clinical presentation. It still has a high mortality rate.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Kral, Alejandro', 'Wilson, Gonzalo']","['Cortes J', 'Kral A', 'Wilson G']",,"['Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.', 'Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.', 'Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.']",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,"['005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Chile', 'Cryptococcosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Cryptococcus neoformans/isolation & purification', 'Deoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182018000400420 [pii]', '10.4067/s0716-10182018000400420 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2018 Aug;35(4):420-423. doi: 10.4067/s0716-10182018000400420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Criptococcosis en el Hospital Carlos Van Buren de Valparaiso: una serie de casos.,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonged hospitalization conditions greater morbidity and risk of acquisition of intranosocomial infections. AIM: To describe risk factors for prolonged hospital length of stay in children with leukemia and bacteremia. METHODS: Cohort study. Episodes of bacteremia in patients with leukemia at Garrahan Hospital from 1/1/2015 to 31/12/2016 were reviewed. We compared data from patients with a LOS of 14 days or more with those admitted for less than 14 days. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis was performed. We used Stata 13 statistical package. RESULTS: n = 121. Median age 59 months.81 patients (67%) had a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by acute myeloid leukemia in 40 (33%). 96 patients (79%) had a central venous catheter (CVC), 94 patients (78%) were neutropenic. Blood cultures were positive for Enterobacteriaceae in 55 cases (45%), coagulase-negative staphylococci in 28 cases (23%), Group viridans Streptococcus in 19 (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8 (7%). (9%). By the multivariate analysis, three factors remained significantly associated with length of stay of more than 14 days: CVC associated bacteremia (OR 21,73; CI95% 1.2-43.2; p 0.04), severe neutropenia (OR 1.75; CI95% 1.82-1.28; p 0.03) and coinfection (OR 27.4; CI95% 2.8-260.8; p 0.004).

AIM: To assess the effect of metformin on the induction stage in patients with ALL and its impact on overall survival and relapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 123 patients treated with metformin and without metformin. The dose used was 850 mg PO at 8 h intervals. The survival analysis was used by Kaplan-Meier method, the difference between the distinct groups was performed using the log Rank test. RESULTS: The overall survival at a median follow up of 700 days of follow-up was 43%, with a disease-free survival of 47%. Regarding the treatment groups, patients with metformin had a lower rate of relapse compared to the group receiving only chemotherapy (6.5% vs 17.1%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of metformin to the conventional treatment of ALL was associated with an improvement in survival, this association being independent of the type of biological risk at diagnosis.","['Ramos Penafiel, Christian', 'Olarte Carrillo, Irma', 'Ceron Maldonado, Rafael', 'Miranda Peralta, Enrique', 'Rozen Fuller, Etta', 'Kassack Ipina, Juan Julio', 'Centeno Cruz, Federico', 'Collazo Jaloma, Juan', 'Martinez Tovar, Adolfo']","['Ramos Penafiel C', 'Olarte Carrillo I', 'Ceron Maldonado R', 'Miranda Peralta E', 'Rozen Fuller E', 'Kassack Ipina JJ', 'Centeno Cruz F', 'Collazo Jaloma J', 'Martinez Tovar A']",,"['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunogenomica y Enfermedades Metabolicas, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica, Secretaria de Salud, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,['9100L32L2N (Metformin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metformin/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872018000700846 [pii]', '10.4067/s0034-98872018000700846 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2018 Jul;146(7):846-853. doi: 10.4067/s0034-98872018000700846.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Efecto de la metformina en la etapa de induccion en pacientes con leucemia aguda linfoblastica y su impacto clinico en la supervivencia.,,,,,,,,,,

To reap the benefit of using retroviruses without severe detrimental effects, we developed several murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based gammaretroviral vectors with safer integration patterns by perturbing the structure of the integrase via insertion of DNA-binding zinc-finger domains (ZFDs) into an internal position of the enzyme. ZFD insertion significantly reduced the inherent, strong MLV integration preference for genomic regions near transcriptional start sites (TSSs), which are the most dangerous spots. The altered retroviral integration pattern was related to increased formation of residual primer-binding site sequences at the 3' end of proviruses. Several ZFD insertion mutants showed lower frequencies of integrations into the TSS genome regions when having the residual primer-binding site sequences in the proviruses. Our findings not only can extend the use of retroviruses in biomedical applications, but also provide a glimpse into the mechanisms underlying retroviral integration.","['Nam, Jung-Soo', 'Lee, Ji-Eun', 'Lee, Kwang-Hee', 'Yang, Yeji', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Bae, Gyu-Un', 'Noh, Hohsuk', 'Lim, Kwang-Il']","['Nam JS', 'Lee JE', 'Lee KH', 'Yang Y', 'Kim SH', 'Bae GU', 'Noh H', 'Lim KI']",,"[""Department of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", 'M Monitor, Inc., Daegu 42713, Korea.', ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Division of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Statistics, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

The aim of our study was to assess the profile of endothelial function at diagnosis time, then during initial treatment phase of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and to verify the presence of its correlation with early clinical outcome (ECO). 28 ALL children and 18 healthy age-matched control ones were recruited. Study group was examined at baseline and at 33rd and 78th day of treatment. At each protocol step the endothelial function was assessed by measurement of sP-selectin (CD62-P), PAI-1(serpinE1), sE-selectin (CD62E), sICAM-1(sCD54), sVCAM-1(sCD106), and VEGF concentrations. Higher baseline sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels and lower sP-selectin and VEGF were observed in children with ALL. sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sE-selectin levels were decreasing following the treatment with protocol I. Higher sE-selectin and lower baseline sICAM-1 levels were observed in children treated unsuccessfully. Lower PAI-1 levels were observed in children who survived. Higher baseline sE-selectin levels and lower sICAM-1 and VEGF were observed in children treated unsuccessfully. A decrease in sE-selectin and lower PAI-1 at the 78th day of therapy were associated with better ECO. High baseline VEGF and sE-selectin levels, significant increase in PAI-1, and low initial sICAM-1 levels are prognostics for poorer prognosis in the ALL children.","['Doroszko, Adrian', 'Niedzielska, Ewa', 'Jakubowski, Maciej', 'Porwolik, Julita', 'Turek-Jakubowska, Aleksandra', 'Szahidewicz-Krupska, Ewa', 'Sieczkowski, Bartosz', 'Dobrowolski, Piotr', 'Radziwon, Aneta', 'Skomro, Robert', 'Derkacz, Arkadiusz', 'Mazur, Grzegorz', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Szuba, Andrzej']","['Doroszko A', 'Niedzielska E', 'Jakubowski M', 'Porwolik J', 'Turek-Jakubowska A', 'Szahidewicz-Krupska E', 'Sieczkowski B', 'Dobrowolski P', 'Radziwon A', 'Skomro R', 'Derkacz A', 'Mazur G', 'Chybicka A', 'Szuba A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5472-028X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0074-1568', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4446-6991', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9964-5305', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9231-7392', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7555-6201']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Clinic of Neurology, Regional Hospital, Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Congenital Heart Diseases, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Glostrup Research Institute, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Division of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska St., Wroclaw, 50-556, Poland.', 'Division of Angiology, Faculty of Health Science, Wroclaw Medical University, 5 Bartla St., Wroclaw, 51-618, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6252207,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/7918091 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2018 Nov 11;2018:7918091. doi: 10.1155/2018/7918091. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Narrowing down to B cell malignancies, many previously unrecognized genes emerged as recurrently mutated. The challenge now is to determine how the mutation in a given gene affects the biology of the disease, paving the way to functional genomics studies. Mutations in NOTCH family members are shared by several disorders of the B series, even if with variable frequencies and mutational patterns. In silico predictions, revealed that mutations occurring in NOTCH receptors, despite being qualitatively different, may have similar effects on protein processing, ultimately leading to enhanced pathway activation. The discovery of mutations occurring also in downstream players, either potentiating positive signals or compromising negative regulators, indicates that multiple mechanisms in neoplastic B cells concur to activate NOTCH pathway. These findings are supported by results obtained in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma where deregulation of NOTCH signaling has been functionally characterized. The emerging picture confirms that NOTCH signaling is finely tuned in cell- and microenvironment-dependent ways. In B cell malignancies, it contributes to the regulation of proliferation, survival and migration. However, deeper biological studies are needed to pinpoint the contribution of NOTCH in the hierarchy of events driving B cells transformation, keeping in mind its role in normal B cells development. Because of its relevance in leukemia and lymphoma biology, the NOTCH pathway might represent an appealing therapeutic target: the next few years will tell whether this potential will be fulfilled.","['Arruga, Francesca', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Arruga F', 'Vaisitti T', 'Deaglio S']",,"['Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6275466,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:01,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00550 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Nov 26;8:550. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00550. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell development', 'NOTCH', 'gene mutations', 'mature B cell malignancies', 'signaling']",,,20181126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical appearance is of an inflammatory cutaneous lesion with a central necrotic spot; the lesion then rapidly progresses to a gangrenous ulcer with a gray-black eschar extending in the deep soft tissues. Treatment of Ecthyma Gangrenosum includes both aggressive systemic antibiotic therapy and surgical procedures. A 2-year-old girl affected by B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was admitted to our hospital for suspected sepsis; the diagnosis was later confirmed by blood cultures positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. In the days following the diagnosis, the patient developed a necrotic lesion of the right gluteal area consistent with Ecthyma Gangrenosum. Aggressive surgical debridement was then performed, followed by negative-pressure wound therapy and reconstruction with dermal substitute and autologous skin graft, which were successful. Ecthyma Gangrenosum is a potentially lethal condition affecting especially immunocompromised patients; aggressive medical treatment with combination antibiotic therapy is warranted and multiple surgical procedures, including extensive surgical debridement and diverting colostomy, are needed. Various reconstructive techniques have been reported in the literature, although no gold-standard can be established to date. Since Ecthyma Gangrenosum lesions are characterized by the presence of both high inflammatory activity due Pseudomonas infection and extensive tissue loss, the association of negative-pressure therapy and dermal substitutes implant seem to have a rationale in the surgical treatment of Ecthyma Gangrenosum and should therefore be considered.","['Persano, Giorgio', 'Pinzauti, Enrico', 'Pancani, Simone', 'Incerti, Filippo']","['Persano G', 'Pinzauti E', 'Pancani S', 'Incerti F']",,"['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Pediatric Burn Center, Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Pediatric Burn Center, Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Design: Cross-sectional observational study design and survey. Animals: 4120 dairy cows from 103 commercial dairy herds in 11 states across the US. Procedures: Milk samples were collected from dairy cows through routine commercial sampling and tested for anti-BLV antibodies by antibody capture ELISA. Based on the ELISA results of a sample of an average of 40 cows per herd, within-herd apparent prevalence (AP) was estimated by a directly standardized method and by a lactation-weighted method for each herd. Within-herd AP estimates were summarized to give estimates of US herd-level and animal-level AP. Differences in AP by lactation, region, state, breed, and herd size were examined to characterize basic epidemiologic features of BLV infection. Results: 94.2% of herds had at least one BLV antibody positive cow detected. The average within-herd standardized AP was 46.5%. Lactation-specific AP increased with increasing lactation number, from 29.7% in first lactation cows to 58.9% in 4th and greater lactation cows. Significant differences were not observed based on region, state, breed, or herd size. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: These results are consistent with a historical trend of increasing prevalence of BLV among US dairy cattle. Given the findings of other studies on the negative impacts of BLV infection on milk production and cow longevity, these findings are clinically relevant for veterinarians counseling dairy clients on the risks of BLV to their herds.","['LaDronka, Rebecca M', 'Ainsworth, Samantha', 'Wilkins, Melinda J', 'Norby, Bo', 'Byrem, Todd M', 'Bartlett, Paul C']","['LaDronka RM', 'Ainsworth S', 'Wilkins MJ', 'Norby B', 'Byrem TM', 'Bartlett PC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0747-5714'],"['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'North Star Cooperative, 4200 Forest Rd., Lansing, MI 48910, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Med Int,Veterinary medicine international,101524203,,,,PMC6252197,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:01,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/5831278 [doi]'],epublish,Vet Med Int. 2018 Nov 11;2018:5831278. doi: 10.1155/2018/5831278. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,20181111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D receptor fok1 (VDR fok1) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene polymorphisms with the glucocorticoid (GC) induced osteonecrosis (ON) in Egyptian pediatric ALL patients. In addition, to identify the possible association of genetic polymorphisms with other factors such as gender and ALL subtypes. Patients and Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted on 102 pediatric ALL patients under the age of 18 who were treated at Children Cancer Hospital Egypt according to St Jude SR/HR total XV protocol. The recruited patients were composed of 51 cases who developed GC-induced osteonecrosis and 51 age- and gender-matched patients who received glucocorticoids but remained osteonecrosis-free (controls). Genotyping of the VDR fok1 and TYMS genes was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and conventional PCR, respectively. Results: For the total 102 studied patients, the VDR fok1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) frequency distribution were TT (8.8%), CT (34.3%), and CC (56.9%), while the TYMS tandem repeat gene variations were reported as 2R2R (20.6%), 2R3R (45.1%), and 3R3R (34.3%). VDR fok1 and TYMS polymorphic variants showed no association neither with gender; P-values 0.3808 and 0.1503, respectively, nor with ALL subtypes; P-values 0.9396 and 0.6596, respectively. The VDR fok1 polymorphisms showed a significant association with the development of ON; P-value = 0.003, on the other hand, TYMS tandem repeats did not show significant impact on osteonecrosis development; P-value = 0.411. Conclusion: This study showed a significant association between the VDR fok1 polymorphism and osteonecrosis. Such clinical pharmacogenetics results would be promising to discuss the possibility of dose adjustments aiming a regimen with the highest efficacy and least toxicity.","['ElHarouni, Dina', 'Yassin, Dina', 'Ali, Nesreen', 'Gohar, Seham', 'Zaky, Iman', 'Adwan, Hassan', 'Sidhom, Iman']","['ElHarouni D', 'Yassin D', 'Ali N', 'Gohar S', 'Zaky I', 'Adwan H', 'Sidhom I']",,"['Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biotechnology German University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt and National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt and National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Radiology Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt and National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biotechnology German University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt and National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6266501,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:01,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00541 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Nov 23;8:541. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00541. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL - acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TYMS polymorphism', 'VDR', 'Vit D receptor', 'glucocorticoid', 'osteonecrosis']",,,20181123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have assessed the contribution of the genotype of XRCC3, a homologous repair gene, to the occurrence or prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated the contribution of seven XRCC3 polymorphisms to childhood ALL. Patients and methods: We recruited 266 patients with childhood ALL and 266 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples. The XRCC3 rs1799794, rs45603942, rs1799796, rs861530, rs28903081, rs861539, and rs3212057 polymorphic genotypes of each subject were determined through conventional polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Results: Genotypes with the rs861539 polymorphism were significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL. The allelic distribution analyses suggested a significant association between the T allele at rs861539 with an increased risk of childhood ALL in the Taiwanese population. Polymorphic variants of XRCC3 at rs3212057 or rs28903081 did not exist in the study population. XRCC3 rs1799794, rs45603942, rs1799796, and rs861530 were not significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL in the Taiwanese population. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that XRCC3 genotypes with polymorphisms at rs861539 may play a role in determining individual susceptibility to childhood ALL in this Taiwanese population.

However, there is no report about whether BBM could enhance the anticancer effect of radiation, which made us to explore the possible radiosensitization effect of BBM. Materials and methods: Here, in vitro cytotoxicity of BBM was evaluated on two kinds of head and neck squamous cancer cell lines. Clonogenic assay was performed to study the radiosensitization effect of BBM. Western blot was utilized to elucidate the possible mechanism underlying the radiosensitization effect. Results: BBM effectively inhibited the growth of two kinds of cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation plus BBM led to significantly more reduction of the colony-forming ability of cancer cells when compared with radiation alone. BBM plus radiation led to the most reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation, followed by the significant decrease of the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. In vivo study demonstrated that the combinational administration of BBM and radiation generated the most significant tumor-delaying effect among all of the treatment regimens. Conclusion: We reported, in the current study, the potential role of BBM in not only treating cancer by itself but also offering a promising way to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy by inhibiting the activation of STAT3 and subsequently inducing the apoptosis of cancer.","['Zhu, Hongmei', 'Ruan, Shu', 'Jia, Feng', 'Chu, Jiusheng', 'Zhu, Yong', 'Huang, Yongjiu', 'Liu, Guan']","['Zhu H', 'Ruan S', 'Jia F', 'Chu J', 'Zhu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Liu G']",,"[""Department of Otolaryngology, Jiangsu Taizhou People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu Province, China, 13952645440@163.com."", 'Department of Endocrinology, Yancheng Third Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Yancheng 224001, Jiangsu Province, China.', ""Department of Neurosurgery, Yancheng City No 1 People's Hospital, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Nantong Medical College, Yancheng 224005, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Otolaryngology, Jiangsu Taizhou People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu Province, China, 13952645440@163.com."", ""Department of Otolaryngology, Jiangsu Taizhou People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu Province, China, 13952645440@163.com."", ""Department of Otolaryngology, Jiangsu Taizhou People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu Province, China, 13952645440@163.com."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou 310022, Zhejiang Province, China, liuguan@zjcc.org.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6241700,,2018/12/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:01,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S171212 [doi]', 'ott-11-8117 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Nov 14;11:8117-8125. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S171212. eCollection 2018.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HNSCC', 'berbamine', 'radiation', 'sensitization']",,,20181114,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacological activity of ATRA is mediated by the ligand-activated RAR and RXR transcription factors. In the present study, we define the basal and ATRA dependent RARalpha interactome in a RARalpha-overexpressing breast cancer cellular model, identifying 28 nuclear proteins. We focus our attention on the S100A3 calcium-binding protein, which interacts with RARalpha constitutively. In ATRA-sensitive breast cancer cells, S100A3 binds to RARalpha in basal conditions and binding is reduced by the retinoid. The interaction of S100A3 with RARalpha is direct and in lung cancer, APL and acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) cells. In APL, S100A3 interacts not only with RARalpha, but also with PML-RARalpha. The interaction surface maps to the RARalpha ligand-binding domain, where the I396 residue plays a crucial role. Binding of S100A3 to RARalpha/PML-RARalpha controls the constitutive and ATRA-dependent degradation of these receptors. S100A3 knockdown decreases the amounts of RARalpha in breast- and lung cancer cells, inducing resistance to ATRA-dependent anti-proliferative/differentiating effects. Conversely, S100A3 knockdown in PML-RARalpha(+) APL and PML-RARalpha(-) AML cells reduces the amounts of RARalpha/PML-RARalpha and increases basal and ATRA-induced differentiation. In this cellular context, opposite effects on RARalpha/PML-RARalpha levels and ATRA-induced differentiation are observed upon S100A3 overexpression. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling RARalpha activity and have practical implications, as S100A3 represents a novel target for rational drug combinations aimed at potentiating the activity of ATRA.","['Gianni, Maurizio', 'Terao, Mineko', 'Kurosaki, Mami', 'Paroni, Gabriela', 'Brunelli, Laura', 'Pastorelli, Roberta', 'Zanetti, Adriana', 'Lupi, Monica', 'Acquavita, Andrea', 'Bolis, Marco', 'Fratelli, Maddalena', 'Rochette-Egly, Cecile', 'Garattini, Enrico']","['Gianni M', 'Terao M', 'Kurosaki M', 'Paroni G', 'Brunelli L', 'Pastorelli R', 'Zanetti A', 'Lupi M', 'Acquavita A', 'Bolis M', 'Fratelli M', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Garattini E']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Functional Genomics and Cancer, IGBMC (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire), INSERM, U964; CNRS, UMR7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 1 rue Laurent Fries, BP 10142, 67404, Illkirch Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, via La Masa 19, 20156, Milano, Italy. enrico.garattini@marionegri.it.']",['eng'],"['to Enrico Garattini/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Italian', 'Association for Cancer Research)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100A3 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'S100 Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC6484772,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0599-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0599-z [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Apr;38(14):2482-2500. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0599-z.

While chromosomal alterations contribute to BCP-ALL pathogenesis, they are insufficient for leukemia development. Epidemiological data and evidence from a mouse model suggest that immune responses to infections may trigger the emergence of leukemia, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that T helper (Th) cells from bone marrow of pediatric BCP-ALL patients can be attracted and activated by autologous BCP-ALL cells. Bone-marrow Th cells supportively interacted with BCP-ALL cells, inducing upregulation of important surface molecules and BCP-ALL cell proliferation. These Th cells displayed a Th1-like phenotype and produced high levels of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma was responsible for the upregulation of CD38 in BCP-ALL cells, a molecule which we found to be associated with early relapse, and accountable for the production of IP-10, a chemokine involved in BCP-ALL migration and drug resistance. Thus, our data provide mechanistic support for an involvement of Th cell immune responses in the propagation of BCP-ALL and suggest that BCP-ALL cell-supportive Th cells may serve as therapeutic target.","['Traxel, Sabrina', 'Schadt, Linda', 'Eyer, Tatjana', 'Mordasini, Vanessa', 'Gysin, Claudine', 'Munthe, Ludvig A', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Nadal, David', 'Burgler, Simone']","['Traxel S', 'Schadt L', 'Eyer T', 'Mordasini V', 'Gysin C', 'Munthe LA', 'Niggli F', 'Nadal D', 'Burgler S']",,"[""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Division of Otolaryngology, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'KG Jebsen Centre for B Cell Malignancies-Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. simone.buergler@kispi.uzh.ch.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0594-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0594-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Mar;38(13):2420-2431. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0594-4.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens provide lower toxicity at the cost of reduced efficacy compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. However, because pre-transplant prognostic variables often determine the conditioning regimen, studies of RIC vs. MAC have been inconclusive. We present a retrospective analysis of 242 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 112 of whom were in 56 pairs matched using propensity scores, to account for variation that may confound clinical outcomes. The uniform conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine with pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided intravenous busulfan (Bu). The RIC and MAC regimens were dosed at the average daily area under the concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) of 4000 microMol min and 5000-6000 microMol min, or total course AUC of 16,000 microMol min and 20,000-24,000 microMol min, respectively; PK-guided dosing removes overlap in systemic Bu exposure. When patients' data were propensity-matched, there was a trend toward significantly increased full donor chimerism and decreased chronic graft vs. host disease in RIC, and no significant differences in progression free survival and overall survival between RIC and MAC. Our results also elucidate the efficacy of PK-guided-dosing in the setting of allo-SCT for AML and MDS.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Kidwell, Kelly M', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Di Stasi, Antonio', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Zope, Madhushree', 'Crain, Alyssa K', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Popat, Uday', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Jones, Roy B', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Alatrash G', 'Kidwell KM', 'Thall PF', 'Di Stasi A', 'Chen J', 'Zope M', 'Crain AK', 'Champlin RE', 'Popat U', 'Shpall EJ', 'Jones RB', 'Andersson BS']",,"['The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'The Departments of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. bandersson@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC6557700,['NIHMS1006137'],2018/12/12 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0405-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0405-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Aug;54(8):1245-1253. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0405-0.

Unfortunately, haplo-HSCT is followed by a delayed immunoreconstitution. The aim of this EBMT registry study was to explore the clinical impact of lymphocyte subset counts after haplo-HSCT. We considered 144 leukaemic patients transplanted in the period 2001-2012. Pre-transplantation clinical variables and differential immune-cell counts (CD3, CD4, CD8 T cells, NK and B cells) measured before day 100 were evaluated for their capacity to predict overall survival, relapse mortality or non-relapse mortality (NRM). Negative prognostic factors for overall survival were advanced disease state at transplantation, host age and CMV seropositivity. Higher CD3, CD4 and CD8 counts were associated with a better overall survival and a lower NRM. Strikingly, when tested in multivariable analysis, higher CD3 and CD8 counts were still significantly associated with a lower NRM. These results indicate that an accelerated T-cell reconstitution correlates with less transplantation mortality, likely due to the protective role of T cells against viral infections. This observation suggests that CD8+ T-cell counts should be investigated as surrogate biomarkers of outcome in prospective haplo-HSCT trials.","['Bondanza, Attilio', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Noviello, Maddalena', 'Eikema, Dirk-Jan', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'van der Werf, Steffie', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Crucitti, Lara', 'Vago, Luca', 'Merluzzi, Mara', 'Massei, Maria Speranza', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Koc, Yener', 'Bader, Peter', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Toubert, Antoine', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Bondanza A', 'Ruggeri L', 'Noviello M', 'Eikema DJ', 'Bonini C', 'Chabannon C', 'van der Werf S', 'van Biezen A', 'de Wreede LC', 'Crucitti L', 'Vago L', 'Merluzzi M', 'Massei MS', 'Veelken H', 'Koc Y', 'Bader P', 'Gruhn B', 'Locatelli F', 'Ciceri F', 'Toubert A', 'Velardi A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3755-4889'],"['San Raffaele University Hospital and Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. attilio.bondanza@gmail.com.', 'Perugia General Hospital and University, Perugia, Italy.', 'San Raffaele University Hospital and Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'San Raffaele University Hospital and Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes and Inserm CBT-1409, Marseille, France.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele University Hospital and Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Perugia General Hospital and University, Perugia, Italy.', 'Perugia General Hospital and University, Perugia, Italy.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'San Raffaele University Hospital and Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Perugia General Hospital and University, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/12/12 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2018/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0351-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0351-x [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Jun;54(6):867-876. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0351-x.
