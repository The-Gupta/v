Previous studies had demonstrated that the Fv1-mediated viral tropism is determined within the capsid protein gene, and that N- and B-tropic virus capsids differ only in two adjacent amino acids. We introduced various amino acid substitutions at these two sites in the N-tropic AKV MLV capsid gene, and typed resulting viruses for host range on cells carrying all five Fv1 alleles as well as on cells from additional wild mouse species with Fv1-like differences in virus susceptibility. Results indicate that alteration of the first of the two amino acids does not alter tropism, but alteration of the second alone is sufficient to convert the N-tropic AKV MLV to a B-tropic virus. Substitution of leucine for arginine at this site produced a virus with an unusual tropism not characteristic of any of the naturally occurring or laboratory strains of MuLV.","['Kozak, C A', 'Chakraborti, A']","['Kozak CA', 'Chakraborti A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA. ckozak@nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Capsid/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Targeting', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90604-2 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0604 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Nov 15;225(2):300-5. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basic lesions observed in chronic hepatitis are intra-portal inflammatory infiltrate, piecemeal necrosis, lobular necrotico-inflammatory lesions, and fibrosis. The histological activity of chronic hepatitis is usually assessed by apply Knodell's score or histological activity index (HAI). This score includes inflammatory lesions and fibrosis. But fibrosis is in fact the consequence of portal and lobular inflammation. The current classifications, including that proposed at the 1994 world conference on gastroenterology, propose discriminating between activity, or grade, and fibrosis, or stage. The classification of chronic hepatitis has also been revised because it was ill-adapted to assessing the C virus-linked chronic hepatitis. Histologically, these are little active chronic hepatitis associated with intra-sinusoidal inflammatory infiltrates of the leukaemia type, intralobular microgranulomas, intraportal lymphoid aggregates, and lesions of the small biliary tracts. Although non-specific, these lesions are evocative enough to histologically back-up diagnosis. Liver biopsy confirms chronic hepatitis diagnosis, determines its grade and stage, sometimes its cause. Liver biopsy also permits assessing treatment response.","['Mosnier, J F']",['Mosnier JF'],"['Department of Pathology, Hopital de Bellevue, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hepacivirus/immunology', 'Hepatitis C/*classification/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Prognosis']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ndt/11.supp4.12 [doi]'],ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1996;11 Suppl 4:12-5. doi: 10.1093/ndt/11.supp4.12.,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of the mouse STAT3 gene was almost identical to that of the human STAT2 gene, including the number and size of exons, indicating that the exon-intron organization had already been accomplished before these two genes duplicated, and then these genes evolved to respond to different ligands. By molecular linkage analysis with interspecific backcross mice the STAT3 gene mapped at 1.4 cM proximal to D11Mit59 on mouse chromosome 11. The promoter region contained potential regulatory elements such as GATA, NF-IL-6, PEBP2, Sp-1, AP-2 binding sites, cAMP response element, CAAT box and E-box.

We addressed the specificity and function of Tax interaction with members of the NF-kappa B/I kappa B alpha family by using EMSA, protein affinity chromatography, protein-protein crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The results of the present study demonstrate that: (1) Tax enhances NF-kappa B binding to DNA 40- to 100-fold by increasing NF-kappa B dimer formation which can be detected in the absence of DNA; (2) Tax binds to all NF-kappa B DNA binding subunits in vitro and to I kappa B alpha; (3) Tax physically associates with I kappa B alpha in vivo; and (4) Tax and I kappa B alpha have antagonistic effects on NF-kappa B binding and gene activity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a 54-month period, 373 patients with hematologic malignancies underwent allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or blood stem-cell transplantation using high-dose thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (TBC) as the preparative regimen. Four patients with active CNS disease at BMT and 20 patients with a history of prior CNS disease were identified. The outcomes of those with a history of CNS disease were compared with those of a matched control group. RESULTS: Of four patients with active CNS disease at the time of BMT, two had CNS recurrences and one recurred in the bone marrow. One patient died of treatment-related toxicity. Four of 20 patients with prior CNS involvement currently remain free of disease. At 2 years, the disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 23% +/- 19%, and the DFS rate for the control group 39% +/- 24% (P = .053). An increased rate of treatment-related toxicity and especially grades II to IV CNS toxicity accounted for the poorer outcome of patients who had a history of CNS disease.

CONCLUSION: Consolidation with TBC and BMT can induce prolonged DFS in a proportion of patients with a history of CNS disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 8541, a randomized study of schedule and dose of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) for stage II breast cancer patients with positive regional lymph nodes, provided data on 1,435 women for analysis. Using body-mass index (BMI), we classified a woman as obese if her BMI was > or = 27.3 kg/m2; doses were considered weight-based if within 5% of values calculated using actual weight. Our primary analysis concerned toxicity risks during cycle 1. RESULTS: Among women who received weight-based doses of the most dose-intensive CAF regimen, 47% of obese and 51% of nonobese women experienced severe hematologic toxicity (grade > or = 3) during cycle 1 (P = .51, two-tailed). The overall risk ratio (obese v nonobese) of treatment failure among women who received weight-based doses during cycle 1 was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.26), stratified by treatment and adjusted for number of positive nodes, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and tumor size. The overall adjusted failure risk ratio (weight-based v reduced initial doses) was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.00) among obese women. CONCLUSION: Obese patients initially dosed (within 5%) by actual weight did not experience excess cycle 1 toxicity or worse outcome compared with nonobese women dosed similarly. The data suggest that obese women who received reduced doses in cycle 1 experienced worse failure-free survival. We recommend that initial doses of CAF be computed according to actual body weight.","['Rosner, G L', 'Hargis, J B', 'Hollis, D R', 'Budman, D R', 'Weiss, R B', 'Henderson, I C', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Rosner GL', 'Hargis JB', 'Hollis DR', 'Budman DR', 'Weiss RB', 'Henderson IC', 'Schilsky RL']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Office, Durham, NC, USA.

METHODS: MTX-CH injected subcutaneously into the left hind foot pad of rats delivered greater amounts of methotrexate selectively to the regional lymph nodes and to the injection site for longer periods than did the same dose of methotrexate in aqueous solution. Seven days after mice received a subcutaneous inoculation with 5 x 10(5) P388 leukemia cells in the left hind foot pad, when metastasis had occurred in the left popliteal lymph node, methotrexate was injected subcutaneously into the left hind foot pad in the form of either MTX-CH or methotrexate aqueous solution. In clinical trials, patients with cancers in relatively early stages (5 patients with gastric cancer and 1 with esophageal cancer) each received local injections of MTX-CH doses of 250 to 500 mg under fiberscope. RESULTS: MTX-CH extended the survival time better than did methotrexate aqueous solution. In mice who received an inoculation of P388 leukemia cells and drug treatment using the same procedures, the treatment effects on metastases to the regional lymph nodes were significantly greater in mice treated with the MTX-CH than in those given methotrexate aqueous solution. MTX-CH controlled the disease well for 25 to 35 months. CONCLUSIONS: Local injection of MTX-CH is apparently useful for treating digestive cancers with lymph node metastases in patients who have difficulty tolerating surgery.","['Hagiwara, A', 'Takahashi, T', 'Sawai, K', 'Sakakura, C', 'Hoshima, M', 'Ohyama, T', 'Ohgaki, M', 'Imanishi, T', 'Yamamoto, A', 'Muranishi, S']","['Hagiwara A', 'Takahashi T', 'Sawai K', 'Sakakura C', 'Hoshima M', 'Ohyama T', 'Ohgaki M', 'Imanishi T', 'Yamamoto A', 'Muranishi S']","['Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dosage Forms)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Carbon', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Dosage Forms', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1996/11/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961115)78:10<2199::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Nov 15;78(10):2199-209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No excess risk of death from other diseases has been found. The favourable mortality might be from a ""healthy worker effect', but the increase in death from liver cancer in the absence of excess deaths from cirrhosis is biologically plausible and justifies further investigation.

The deregulated expression of bcl-2 was found to contribute to multistep neoplasia through the suppression of cell death, or apoptosis, in transgenic mouse models. Bcl-2 was subsequently shown to be normally expressed in a variety of tissues and to significantly inhibit the induction of apoptosis in many experimental systems. Bcl-2 is now known to be structurally similar to other proteins, in particular within the domains referred to as BH1 and BH2. This multigene family of cell death regulators includes members which enhance rates of apoptosis, including bcl-xs and bax, and those which inhibit apoptosis, including MCL-1 and bcl-xL. Members of the bcl-2 family physically interact with other proteins, including other family members and these interactions appear to modulate their function. The mechanism(s) by which bcl-2 family members regulate cell death remain in large part unknown, although recent evidence suggests that bcl-2 may interfere with cellular signalling events involved in apoptosis induction.","['McDonnell, T J', 'Beham, A', 'Sarkiss, M', 'Andersen, M M', 'Lo, P']","['McDonnell TJ', 'Beham A', 'Sarkiss M', 'Andersen MM', 'Lo P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.

According to the Kiel Classification, these lymphomas are of centroblastic or immunoblastic type, corresponding in the Working Formulation to malignant lymphoma, large cell non-cleaved and large cell immunoblastic, respectively. Adhesive cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are generally assumed to play an important part in the metastatic process, and to find clues to the highly malignant biological behaviour of this tumour we examined expression of integrins and other adhesion molecules on the tumour cells and the presence of matrix proteins. Few adhesion molecules appeared to be expressed. CD44 was expressed in 10/12 lymphomas, CD49f/VLA-6 was positive in 5/12 cases, and CD49d/VLA-4, CD54 and CD62L were detectable in a small number (2-3) of lymphomas. All other adhesion molecules were lacking. This expression pattern is suggestive of a high metastatic potential: the tumour cells seem to be poorly attached to the extracellular matrix, to each other and to other cells (CD54-, CD11a-, CD58-). The adhesion molecules expressed, CD44, CD49f/VLA-6 and CD49d/VLA-4, have been reported to play a part in dissemination, mediating intravasation (CD49f/VLA-6) and extravasation (CD44, CD49d/VLA-4). This profile of adhesion molecules may explain, at least in part, the specific biological behaviour of these lymphomas with early and rapid dissemination.","['Horstmann, W G', 'Timens, W']","['Horstmann WG', 'Timens W']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00192429 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 1996 Oct;429(2-3):83-90. doi: 10.1007/BF00192429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, it is proposed that the metabolism of the phosphoramidate diesters of FUdR in proliferating tissue proceeds through two separate enzymatic steps involving P-N bond cleavage by an unknown phosphoramidase followed by P-O bond cleavage by phosphatases such as 5'-nucleotidase.","['Abraham, T W', 'Kalman, T I', 'McIntee, E J', 'Wagner, C R']","['Abraham TW', 'Kalman TI', 'McIntee EJ', 'Wagner CR']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*chemistry', 'Floxuridine/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/08 00:00,1996/11/08 00:01,['1996/11/08 00:00'],"['1996/11/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/08 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm9603680 [doi]', 'jm9603680 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Nov 8;39(23):4569-75. doi: 10.1021/jm9603680.,,,"['AI 27251/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 61908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether the functional loss of p53 plays a direct role in the transition of chronic phase to blast crisis, bone marrow cells from p53+/+ or p53-/- mice were infected with a retrovirus carrying either the wild-type BCR/ABL or the inactive kinase-deficient mutant, and were assessed for colony-forming ability. Infection of p53-/- marrow cells with wild-type BCR/ABL, but not with the kinase-deficient mutant, enhanced formation of hematopoietic colonies and induced growth factor independence at high frequency, as compared with p53+/+ marrow cells. These effects were suppressed when p53-/- marrow cells were coinfected with BCR/ ABL and wild-type p53. p53-deficient BCR/ABL-infected marrow cells had a proliferative advantage, as reflected by an increase in the fraction of S+G2 phase cells and a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. Immunophenotyping and morphological analysis revealed that BCR/ABL-positive p53-/- cells were much less differentiated than their BCR/ABL-positive p53+/+ counterparts. Injection of immunodeficient mice with BCR/ABL-positive p53-/- cells produced a transplantable, highly aggressive, poorly differentiated acute myelogenous leukemia. In marked contrast, the disease process in mice injected with BCR/ABL-positive p53+/+ marrow cells was characterized by cell infiltrates with a more differentiated phenotype and was significantly retarded, as indicated by a much longer survival of leukemic mice. Together, these findings directly demonstrate that loss of p53 function plays an important role in blast transformation in CML.","['Skorski, T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Wlodarski, P', 'Perrotti, D', 'Martinez, R', 'Wasik, M A', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Wlodarski P', 'Perrotti D', 'Martinez R', 'Wasik MA', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency']",1996/11/12 00:00,1996/11/12 00:01,['1996/11/12 00:00'],"['1996/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.23.13137 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Nov 12;93(23):13137-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.23.13137.,PMC24059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetic parameters, including the Km value for LTC4 of 118 +/- 5 nM and the inhibition constants for transport of both substrates for the quinoline-based inhibitor MK 571, were similar to those obtained for transport mediated by recombinant MRP.

The present study describes the genetic construction, expression, purification and properties of a diphtheria-toxin-related LIF gene fusion in which the native receptor-binding domain of diphtheria toxin was replaced with a gene encoding human LIF. The fusion protein expressed from the chimeric tox gene was designated DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide. This fusion protein has a deduced molecular mass of 65980 Da and is formed by fusion of the first 389 amino acids of diphtheria toxin to amino acids 2-184 of mature human LIF, using a linker of 34 amino acids that includes six consecutive histidine residues. The latter span allows for single-step purification of the fusion protein by Ni(2+)-resin affinity chromatography. This linker provides a high degree of flexibility between the diphtheria toxin and LIF domains, thereby permitting aggregation-free refolding of the chimeric protein while bound to the affinity column. Both LIF and DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide induced the phosphorylation of CLIP1 and CLIP2 in LIF-responsive neuroblastoma SH-N-BE cells. DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide was selectively cytotoxic for cultured neuroblastoma cells bearing the LIF receptor, and for sympathetic neurons. The cytotoxic action of DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide, like that of native diphtheria toxin, required receptor-mediated endocytosis, passage through an acidic compartment, and delivery of an ADP-ribosyltransferase to the cytosol of target cells. The latter point was confirmed by the fact that, while both LIF and DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide increased c-fos mRNA expression in SH-N-BE cells, only LIF induced proenkephalin and c-fos promoter activities in cells transiently transfected with c-fos-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and proenkephalin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes. Mutational analysis suggested that the C-terminal helix (helix D) of human LIF may, in part, constitute or contribute to the active site for LIF receptor binding and cell activation. The cytotoxic properties of DT-(1-389)-LIF-(2-184)-peptide may be useful in selectively depleting neuronal and immune cell populations that express the LIF beta receptor.","['Negro, A', 'Skaper, S D']","['Negro A', 'Skaper SD']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, CRIBI Biotechnology Center, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (proenkephalin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Diphtheria Toxin/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Enkephalins/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, fos/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00507.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Oct 15;241(2):507-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00507.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When cells were cultured in DHA-supplemented medium, DHA incorporated rapidly and preferentially into phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), with lesser and slower incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC). DHA at low concentrations preferred PE over neutral lipids, but in DHA excess accumulation in neutral lipids outstripped that of phospholipids. High DHA levels reduced cell growth in the apparent absence of lipid peroxidation. To study the importance of DHA's phospholipid class, cells were fused with lipid vesicles of either 18:0, 22:6 PE or 18:0, 22:6 PC.

These results provoke the interesting speculation that T27A cells can safely accumulate DHA in PE, but are vulnerable if excessive DHA is incorporated into PC.","['Zerouga, M', 'Stillwell, W', 'Stone, J', 'Powner, A', 'Jenski, L J']","['Zerouga M', 'Stillwell W', 'Stone J', 'Powner A', 'Jenski LJ']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Purdue University at Indianapolis 46202-5132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Sep-Oct;16(5A):2863-8.,,,['R01CA57212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This carrier, named nanoerythrosome (nEryt), is prepared by extrusion of erythrocyte ghosts to produce small vesicles having an average diameter of 100 nm. Daunorubicin (DNR) was covalently conjugated to the nEryt (nEryt-DNR) using glutaraldehyde as homobifunctional linking arm. This led to a complex that is more active than free DNR both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we identified the mechanisms that make the complex nEryt-DNR more active than free DNR. Using fluorescence microscopy and cellular-uptake, we observed that the nEryt-DNR complex cannot diffuse through the cell membrane and do not enter the cell by endocytosis. Our results suggest that the nEryt-DNR is rapidly absorbed onto the cell membrane. Free DNR is then slowly released by hydrolysis of the glutaraldehyde linking arm, producing a high concentration of free DNR in the cell's vicinity over a long period of time.","['Moorjani, M', 'Lejeune, A', 'Gicquaud, C', 'Lacroix, J', 'Poyet, P', 'Gaudreault, R C']","['Moorjani M', 'Lejeune A', 'Gicquaud C', 'Lacroix J', 'Poyet P', 'Gaudreault RC']","['Departement de Chimie-Biologie, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Carriers', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Sep-Oct;16(5A):2831-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, HbA2 levels are normally low in sickle cell patients. We show that a major reason for low delta-globin gene expression is the defective CACCC box at -90 in the delta-globin promoter. When the CACCC box defect in delta is corrected, expression of an HS2 delta /Luciferase reporter is equivalent to HS2 beta /Luciferase. Erythroid Krupple-like factor (EKLF), which binds to the CACCC box of the beta-globin gene and activates high-level expression, does not bind to the normal delta-globin promoter. Our goal is to design a modified EKLF that binds to the defective delta-globin promoter and enhances delta-globin gene expression. To test the feasibility of this strategy, we inserted the beta-globin CACCC box at -90 of the delta-globin gene promoter to produce an HS2 delta CAC-beta construct and quantitated human delta- and beta-globin mRNA in stably transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. delta- Globin mRNA in these cells was 22.0% +/- 9.0% of total human globin mRNA (delta/delta + beta) as compared with 3.0% +/- 1.3% in the HS2 delta-beta control. In a second set of experiments a GAL4 DNA-binding site was inserted at -90 of the delta-globin gene to produce an HS2 delta GAL4-beta construct. This construct and a GAL4(1-147)/EKLF expression vector were stably transfected into MEL cells. delta-Globin mRNA in these cells was 27.8% +/- 7.1% of total human globin mRNA as compared with 9.9% +/- 2.5% in the HS2 delta GAL4-beta plus GAL4(1-147) control. These results show that delta-globin gene expression can be significantly increased by a modified EKLF. Based on these results, we suggest that modified EKLFs, which contain zinc fingers designed to bind specifically to the defective delta-globin CACCC box, may be useful in gene therapy approaches to increase HbA2 levels and inhibit HbS polymerization.","['Donze, D', 'Jeancake, P H', 'Townes, T M']","['Donze D', 'Jeancake PH', 'Townes TM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9034-53-1 (Hemoglobin A2)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Feasibility Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobin A2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61331-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):4051-7.,,,"['5 T32 CA09467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 43508/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flt3-L is produced by BM stromal cells and its receptor is expressed in the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Therefore, flt3-L may play a role in the paracrine and/or autocrine loops sustaining leukemic cell growth. We evaluated the effects of recombinant human flt3-L on proliferation, apoptosis, and Bcl-2 and Bax expression in primary AML cells and compared them with those of stem cell factor (SCF). Mononuclear BM cells from patients with newly diagnosed AML were cultured in serum-free conditions with flt3-L, SCF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone and in combination. In 9 of 10 samples, flt3-L significantly increased [3H]thymidine uptake (geometric mean stimulation index, 7.5; range, 2.4 to 41.5). Flt3-L also increased the number of AML blast colonies by 126% (range, 61% to 181%). In these 9 samples, flt3-L significantly enhanced the proliferative response triggered by G-CSF or GM-CSF. Flt3-L prevented apoptosis in AML blasts. It reduced the number of apoptotic cells by 36% +/- 3.9% compared with control cultures. Combining flt3-L with G-CSF or GM-CSF doubled the antiapoptotic effect. Cellular Bcl-2 and Bax levels were determined separately for apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis had low Bcl-2 and high Bax levels, whereas nonapoptotic cells had high Bcl-2 and low Bax levels. Flt3-L alone or in combination with G-CSF or GM-CSF did not upregulate Bcl-2. However, Bax expression decreased in viable cells in the presence of these cytokines and the lowest level was achieved when a combination of flt3 and GM-CSF was used. Proliferative and viability effects of flt3-L were similar to those of SCF. Our results demonstrate that flt3-L acts as a stimulatory factor for primary AML cells. The antiapoptotic effects of flt3-L or its combinations with G-CSF or GM-CSF correlate with their ability to prevent upregulation of Bax.","['Lisovsky, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Zhang, X', 'Consoli, U', 'Sanchez-Williams, G', 'Snell, V', 'Munker, R', 'Goodacre, A', 'Savchenko, V', 'Andreeff, M']","['Lisovsky M', 'Estrov Z', 'Zhang X', 'Consoli U', 'Sanchez-Williams G', 'Snell V', 'Munker R', 'Goodacre A', 'Savchenko V', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61323-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3987-97.,,,"['CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also shown that exogenous IL-10 supported the growth of XG-1 and XG-2 human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) through an IL-6-independent mechanism. (Lu et al, Blood 85:2521, 1995). Because the IL-10 receptor does not involve the gp 130 IL-6 transducer, we have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of IL-10 action on myeloma cells. Our results indicate that the myeloma cell growth factor activity of IL-10 was abrogated by an antibody to the gp 130 IL-6 transducer, indicating that it was mediated through one of the gp 130-activating cytokines. We found that myeloma cells from XG-1 and XG-2 HMCL and from 5 of 6 patients' tumoral samples produced oncostatin M (OM) constitutively but failed to produce IL-6, IL-11 and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF). The autocrine OM was inactive in the absence of IL-10 due to lack of a functional OM receptor on myeloma cells. IL-10, by inducing the receptor for LIF (LIFR), produced a functional autocrine OM loop in XG-1 and XG-2 cells and in primary myeloma cells from 2 patients. We also found that some myeloma cell lines (XG-4, XG-6, and XG-7) an fresh myeloma cells from 3 of 6 patients produced an autocrine IL-10 and that these cells constitutively expressed LIFR. One HMCL (XG-7) produced IL-10, OM, and IL-6 an expressed LIFR. The XG-7 cells used OM and IL-6 as autocrine growth factors. We have previously shown that IL-10 could induce IL-11 receptor in myeloma cells and confer on them sensitivity to IL-11 (Lu et al, FEBS Lett 377:515, 1995). Taken together, these results show that IL-10 is a key cytokine for inducing the expression of LIFR and IL-11R and possibly another uncharacterized OM coreceptor on myeloma cells and that OM and IL-10 might be produced by myeloma cells. They also emphasize that all myeloma cell growth factors reported to data involve an activation of the gp130 IL-6 transducer.","['Gu, Z J', 'Costes, V', 'Lu, Z Y', 'Zhang, X G', 'Pitard, V', 'Moreau, J F', 'Bataille, R', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Rossi, J F', 'Klein, B']","['Gu ZJ', 'Costes V', 'Lu ZY', 'Zhang XG', 'Pitard V', 'Moreau JF', 'Bataille R', 'Wijdenes J', 'Rossi JF', 'Klein B']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61322-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3972-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred five consecutive patients with adult AML entered on a multicenter treatment trial were studied with a comprehensive set of DNA probes recognizing the most relevant AML-associated structural and numerical chromosome aberrations: translocations t(8;21), t(15;17), and t(11q23); inversion inv(16);chromosomal deletions (5q-, 7q-, 9q-, 12p-, 13q-, 17p-, and 20q-); and chromosomal aneuploidies. Interphase cytogenetics was particularly sensitive for detecting the AML-specific gene fusions: 3 additional cases of inv(16) and 1 additional case of t(8;21) were identified by FISH that were missed by banding analysis, whereas equal numbers of t(11q23) and t(15;17) were detected. Five additional cases of trisomy 8q, 3 more cases of trisomy 11q, and 2 more cases of trisomies 21q and 22q were shown by FISH. These aberrations were either masked in complex karyo-types or identified in cases in which conventional banding analysis failed. On the other hand, the DNA probes selected were not informative to detect 1 case of 5q-, 9q-, and 20q-. In 5 cases, clonal aberrations were detected on banding analysis for which no FISH probes were selected. In conclusion, interphase cytogenetics proved to be more sensitive for detecting AML-specific chimeric gene fusions and some partial trisomies. Interphase cytogenetics provides a powerful technique complementary and, with further development of diagnostic DNA probes, even an alternative to chromosome banding studies for the cytogenetic analysis of AML.","['Fischer, K', 'Scholl, C', 'Salat, J', 'Frohling, S', 'Schlenk, R', 'Bentz, M', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Fischer K', 'Scholl C', 'Salat J', 'Frohling S', 'Schlenk R', 'Bentz M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Oncogenes']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61321-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3962-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), these processes are particularly prominent and result in diagnostic appearances in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The present study explores the mechanisms that underlie these tissue reactions. Using a human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) model, various possible receptor-ligand interactions between hairy cells (HCs) and ECs were examined and a central importance for alpha 4 beta 1/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was established. This receptor-ligand pair was shown to be important both for strong adhesion and for HC motility/transmigration. A similar importance for alpha 4 beta 1/VCAM-1 was established for the interaction between HCs and relevant tissue accessory cells. The in vitro relevance of these findings was confirmed by the demonstration of VCAM-1 in HCL spleen and by the fact that, in frozen sections, HCs adhered (via VCAM-1) to the red pulp, but not to other areas of normal spleen. These results indicate that alpha 4 beta 1/VCAM-1 is central to the interaction between HCs and endothelium/accessory cells. Such interactions, together with the intrinsic cell activation characteristic of HCL and the HC's consequent ability to interact with matrix, are responsible for many of the characteristic features of the disease.","['Vincent, A M', 'Burthem, J', 'Brew, R', 'Cawley, J C']","['Vincent AM', 'Burthem J', 'Brew R', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*physiology']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61319-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3945-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML is expressed in diverse tissues and cell lines and localized in the nucleus with a typical speckled pattern. In the bone marrow, it is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells. PML appears to be transcriptionally regulated by class I and II interferons, which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal myeloid cells and precursors by activating PML-dependent pathways. Similarly, interferons could act on APL cells, alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (RA), especially if the PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript that results from the t(15; 17) is induced by interferon. We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating human monocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonucleate cells, but is markedly induced by interferon; that PML and PML/RAR alpha expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line, which carries the t(15; 17), and in APL blasts from patients; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells; and, finally, that interferon gamma, but not alpha or beta, induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance, and partially restores RA response.","['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Gandini, D', 'Botto, M', 'Allopenna, J', 'Seale, J R', 'Cross, N C', 'Goldman, J M', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Gandini D', 'Botto M', 'Allopenna J', 'Seale JR', 'Cross NC', 'Goldman JM', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61317-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3926-36.,,,"['1F32CA61646-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1 CA62275-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2PO1-CA29502-14A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the in vivo importance of SLF in the maintenance and responsiveness of stem and progenitor cells is well documented, the molecular mechanism involved in its synergistic effects are mainly unknown. Some factor-dependent myeloid cell lines respond to the synergistic proliferative effects of SLF plus other cytokines in a manner similar to that of normal myeloid progenitor cells from bone marrow and cord blood. We show here that SLF can synergize with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to induce an enhanced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product and a synergistic increase in the total intracellular protein level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21cip-1, which is correlated with a simultaneous decrease in p27kip-1 in the human factor-dependent myeloid cell line, M07e. Moreover, these cytokines synergize to increase p21cip-1 binding and decrease p27kip-1 binding to cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk2), an enzyme required for normal cell cycle progression; these inverse events correlated with increased cdk2 kinase activity. It is also shown that exogenous purified p21cip-1 can displace p27kip-1 already bound to cdk2 in vitro. These data implicate increased p21cip-1 and decreased p27kip-1 intracellular concentrations and their stoichiometric interplay in the enhanced proliferative status of cells stimulated by the combination of SLF and GM-CSF. In support of these findings, it is shown that hematopoietic progenitor cells from mice lacking p21cip-1 are defective in SLF synergistic proliferative response in vitro. Moreover, the cycling status of marrow and spleen progenitors and absolute numbers of marrow progenitors were significantly decreased in the p21cip-1 -/-, compared with the +/+ mice. We conclude that the cdk threshold regulators p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 play a critical role in the normal mitogenic response of M07e cells and murine myeloid progenitor cells to these cytokines and particularly in the SLF synergistic proliferative response that is important to the normal maintenance of the stem/progenitor cell compartment.","['Mantel, C', 'Luo, Z', 'Canfield, J', 'Braun, S', 'Deng, C', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Mantel C', 'Luo Z', 'Canfield J', 'Braun S', 'Deng C', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/physiology', 'Cyclins/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61293-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3710-9.,,,"['R01 54037/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients in long-term remission of their disease had a level of up to 1 x 10(3) AML1-MTG8 molecules/microgram RNA. Two patients tested 2 and 4 months before hematologic relapse showed a level of 0.71 x 10(5) molecules/microgram RNA and this level increased further during relapse to 0.71 x 10(7) and 2.27 x 10(5) molecules/microgram RNA, respectively. Our results show that quantitation of AML1-MTG8 transcripts by competitive polymerase chain reaction is valuable in predicting early relapse in AML with t(8;21). Identification of at-risk patients may allow treatment to be modified to include additional or alternative therapy such as bone marrow transplantation.","['Tobal, K', 'Yin, J A']","['Tobal K', 'Yin JA']","['University Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61292-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3704-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated here the molecular basis for PAI-2 synthesis in monocytic cells by reporter gene deletion analysis. A DNA fragment containing 5.1 kb of 5' flanking region through to the start of the second exon was fused to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, transfected into macrophage and nonmacrophage cells and tested for PAI-2 promoter-directed CAT activity in the presence and absence of phorbol ester. Deletion analysis showed the existence of three major transcription regulatory regions. (1) A positive regulatory region contained in the proximal promoter mediates basal transcription and 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate inducibility. (2) A negative regulatory region, or silencer, present between -1977 and -1675, was found to repress PAI-2 promoter activity in an orientation- and position-independent manner, but not in a cell-specific manner. (3) A second positive regulatory element, located upstream between approximately -5100 and -3300, appears to overcome inhibition mediated by the silencer in a cell-specific manner, suggesting a mechanism for the regulation of this gene. We have localized the motif responsible for silencer activity to a 28-bp DNA sequence containing a unique 12-bp palindrome centered at an Xba I restriction enzyme site, CTCTCTAGAGAG, which is designated the PAI-2-upstream silencer element-1 (PAUSE-1). This element binds a specific PAUSE-1 binding factor as determined by mobility shift analysis. We conclude that PAI-2 gene transcription is regulated by both positive and negative control mechanisms that may be important for the regulation of other genes as well.","['Antalis, T M', 'Costelloe, E', 'Muddiman, J', 'Ogbourne, S', 'Donnan, K']","['Antalis TM', 'Costelloe E', 'Muddiman J', 'Ogbourne S', 'Donnan K']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Experimental Oncology Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61290-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3686-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies used the growth factors to decrease the duration of neutropenia with the hope of reducing infectious morbidity and mortality. The results of these trials are generally quite consistent. Virtually all trials showed a modest reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia with a variable effect on the incidence of severe infections, antibiotic usage, and the duration of hospitalization. There was no consistent benefit in terms of improvements in complete response rate, complete response duration, or overall survival. However, it is important that there does not appear to be an increase in the incidence of drug-resistant leukemia in trials in which the growth factor was begun after completion of the chemotherapy. Other trials administered growth factors either before or simultaneous with the chemotherapy in an attempt to enhance chemosensitivity and decrease drug resistance. None of these trials, whether conducted as part of initial induction therapy or in relapse, showed improvements in response rate or survival. Lastly, some anecdotal reports have suggested that occasional patients who receive growth factors as the only therapy for overt leukemia can achieve remission, possibly through a differentiating effect of the growth factor. However, there are very few such reports, and growth factor use in this situation is potentially dangerous and should be performed only in the context of a clinical trial. In summary, there appears to be no role at this time for priming of leukemia cells by growth factors to enhance the effect of chemotherapy, and more in vitro studies should be performed before further clinical trials of this approach. It is clear that growth factors administered after induction and possibly consolidation chemotherapy can shorten the duration of neutropenia, without a significant effect on treatment outcome. It is as yet unclear whether the use of growth factors in this fashion is cost effective.","['Schiffer, C A']",['Schiffer CA'],"['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, University of Maryland Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61289-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 15;88(10):3675-85.,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDA was administered at dosages ranging from an initial dose of 5 mg/m2/d for 3 days with an increment of 2.5 mg/m2/d to 15 mg/m2/d for 3 days. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were thought to be stomatitis and anorexia. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 15 mg/m2/d for 3 days (45 mg/m2 per course). Bone marrow toxicity was significant when greater than 10 mg/m2/d of IDA was given. When IDA was administered at this dosage or higher, there were three CRs and four partial responses, with an overall response rate of 26.9% in 26 assessable patients. It is recommended that a phase II study be undertaken at an IDA dosage of 10 to 15 mg/m2/d for 3 consecutive days in the treatment of acute leukemia. Twenty-one of 32 patients were also studied for the pharmacokinetics of IDA. The terminal half-life (t1/2) values for IDA were 6.4 to 15.1 hours in plasma and 8.09 to 16.34 hours in blood cells. The t1/2 values for idarubicinol were much longer: 43.46 to 51.01 hours in plasma and 36.61 to 54.70 hours in blood cells. Concentrations of idarubicinol in plasma and blood cells exceeded those of IDA 2 to 4 hours after the start of treatment and remained elevated for a long time. The area under the curve (AUC) of idarubicinol in plasma was 5.16 to 8.36 times higher than that of IDA, and the AUC of idarubicinol in blood cells was 2.05 to 4.57 times higher than that of IDA. The AUCs of both IDA and idarubicinol increased dose-dependently over the dosage range of 5 to 15 mg/m2/d. When two-compartment multiple-dose models were used, plasma t1/2 alpha and t1/2 beta values of IDA were 0.25 +/- 0.13 and 9.4 +/- 3.4 hours, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) was 934.9 +/- 370.7 L/m2, and the plasma clearance was 82.3 +/- 29.7 L/h/m2. The urinary excretion of IDA and its metabolite was low.

Granulomatous vasculitis occurs rarely with lymphoproliferative diseases, and even less commonly T-cell lymphocytic vasculitis with eosinophilia. The most common systemic vasculitis is caused by cryoglobulinemia, due to either lymphocytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Other unusual associations involving systemic vasculitides include polyarteritis nodosa and hairy cell leukemia, Wegener's granulomatosis and Hodgkin's disease, granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system and lymphoma, temporal arteritis and lymphoma, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura and lymphoma. The vasculitis may predate the diagnosis of the lymphoproliferative disease, and patients with vasculitis should be screened and monitored for lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Wooten, M D', 'Jasin, H E']","['Wooten MD', 'Jasin HE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,,IM,"['Cryoglobulinemia/complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications/immunology', 'Vasculitis/*etiology/immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(96)80044-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-0172(96)80044-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 1996 Oct;26(2):564-74. doi: 10.1016/s0049-0172(96)80044-8.,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is induced by the endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV), whose genome is inherited as a Mendelian dominant trait. Lymphoma development takes place in multiple stages affected by many host genetic and epigenetic factors. An inbred strain SL/Kh with a high incidence of pre-B lymphomas has been established and the genetic predisposition of SL/Kh mice to lymphomas is being studied in the crosses with other inbred strains of mice. In the cross to the NFS/N lacking endogenous MuLV genome, it has been shown that lymphomas are induced by the expression of Emv-11 provirus (Chr. 7), and the types of B-lineage lymphomas are determined by combinations of the host genes, Esl-1 (Chr. 17) and Foc-1 (Chr. 4). Another gene, Tlsm-1 (Chr. 7) that determines the type of lymphomas to be T-lineage, is identified in the cross with AKR/Ms, with a high incidence of T-lymphomas. The role of the thymus in the development of T-lymphomas in the mouse, and the possible relevance of Tlsm-1 in this step, is discussed. The length of the latent period is determined by a gene Lia-1 (Chr. 17). A maternal resistance factor that is a maternal antibody to MuLV transmitted via milk and that epigenetically inhibits MuLV expression in SL/Ni-Eco-, one of subline of SL/NI mice, has been shown. Weak but definitive maternal resistance also operates in SL/Ni-Eco+, a subline lacking the maternal antibody to MuLV. In the latter, there is a recessive resistance gene Nir-1 (Chr. 4). In the cross with MSM/Ms, a wild mice-derived inbred strain, two resistance genes, Msmr-1 (Chr. 17) and Msmr-2 (Chr. 18), have been identified. In SL/Kh, all of these host genetic and epigenetic factors are favorable for lymphoma development. This model offers not only an understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced lymphomas but also may provide starting material for the comparative approach to homologous human diseases.","['Hiai, H']",['Hiai H'],"['Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1996.tb03539.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1996 Oct;46(10):707-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1996.tb03539.x.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective longitudinal cohort study was undertaken of bone mass and biochemical mineral status in 40 consecutive children (27 male, 13 female, aged 0.3-17.0 years) receiving therapy on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocol 87-01. Radiography, lumbar spine dual-photon absorptiometry, and biochemical measurements of mineral status were performed at diagnosis and at 6-month intervals throughout 24 months of chemotherapy. Eleven patients were not completely evaluated (4 deaths and 7 off study). Radiographic evidence of osteopenia was observed in 10, 64, and 76% at diagnosis, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Fractures occurred in 39% of children during treatment. Reduction in bone mineral content (BMC), as measured by Z scores, occurred in 64% of patients and was most severe in those greater than 11 years of age at diagnosis. Reduction in BMC during the first 6 months of therapy had a positive predictive value of 64%, while an increase in BMC had a negative predictive value of 82% for subsequent fracture. By 6 months of therapy, 31/37 (84%) children were hypomagnesemic, of whom 16 (52%) were hypermagnesuric. Plasma osteocalcin was subnormal at diagnosis in 29/40 (73%) but increased to normal by 6 months of treatment. Vitamin D status was normal throughout, but plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D remained subnormal in greater than 70% of children. Urinary cross-link N-telopeptide was normal at diagnosis and became elevated in 58% of children by the end of therapy. Suppressed bone mineralization is evident at diagnosis in a minority of children with ALL. Skeletal morbidity and a reduction in bone mineral mass become more prevalent during treatment, with increased bone resorption, perhaps mainly as a consequence of corticosteroid administration.","['Halton, J M', 'Atkinson, S A', 'Fraher, L', 'Webber, C', 'Gill, G J', 'Dawson, S', 'Barr, R D']","['Halton JM', 'Atkinson SA', 'Fraher L', 'Webber C', 'Gill GJ', 'Dawson S', 'Barr RD']","['Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,['0 (Minerals)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Bone/epidemiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Minerals/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650111122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1996 Nov;11(11):1774-83. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650111122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When human promyelocytic HL-60 cells were treated with NaF (0.5 mM, 0-4 days), cell proliferation was inhibited, and the addition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) (10nM, 0-4 days) augmented this antiproliferative effect. NaF increased cellular reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and this effect was strongly augmented by 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, NaF produced marked changes in cellular morphology, increased cellular adhesion to plastic, reduced the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and increased cellular expression of chloroacetate esterase, but failed to alter cellular nonspecific esterase activity. Furthermore, NaF increased expression of CD11b and CD66b, and this stimulation was enhanced by adding 1,25(OH)2D3. The sum of these changes in classical promyelocytic cellular indices suggest: (1) that NaF stimulates the early stages of HL-60 differentiation toward a granulocyte-like cell and (2) that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes these actions of NaF. Additional experiments aimed at further understanding the NaF-induced conversion of HL-60 cells identified further changes. NaF also increased cellular production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) and induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); 1,25(OH)2D3 once again augmented these NaF-induced effects. Similarly, NaF stimulated the production of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 1,25(OH)2D3 again strongly enhanced these effects. Indomethacin completely blocked stimulation of NBT reduction, NO production, and iNOS expression induced by NaF plus 1,25(OH)2D3; adding exogenous PGE2 (0.1-10 ng/ml) to these indomethacin-blocked cultures dose-dependently restored NO production. These additional findings together with the observed slow onset (24-48 h) of NaF and 1,25(OH)2D3 interaction strongly suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 acts as a cofactor with NaF primarily through interaction with an endogenous NaF-induced cyclo-oxygenase product(s), quite possibly PGE2 itself. Such a mechanism for NaF and 1,25(OH)2D3 interaction would be strongly analogous to the interaction we have recently demonstrated between 1,25(OH)2D3 and PGE1 on the differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Kawase, T', 'Oguro, A', 'Orikasa, M', 'Burns, D M']","['Kawase T', 'Oguro A', 'Orikasa M', 'Burns DM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Niigata University School of Dentistry, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/metabolism', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sodium Fluoride/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/03/29 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650111111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1996 Nov;11(11):1676-87. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650111111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown, that v-mos oncogene-transformed cells of this line (mos2) induced selective immunological unresponsiveness in vitro. Because the induction of tolerance is of a central importance for the organ transplantation, this phenomenon, found in vitro, was also studied in vivo. We found that the in vivo injection of mos2 cells into mice induced a state of selective noncreativity. To further analyse these effects, we studied whether specific tolerance is the consequence of a decreased number of essential receptors or receptor families. For this purpose C57BL/6 mice were immunized with cells of the parental line P388D1 or mos2 and mos3 clones. Their spleen and thymus cells were examined phenotypically. The most impressive result of this study was a clearly changed amount of T cells receptors in mos2 immunized mice, in which a state of tolerance was induced. In these mice only the expression of CD3 T receptors as well as that of the V beta 11 chains was reduced. In spleen of these mice the CD3 expression was decreased, compared to D1 or nonimmunized control animals by 54-58% and compared to mos3 mice by 38-40%. Even though the differences in the thymus were not very pronounced, we still saw a decrease in CD3 stained cells selective in mos2 immunized C57B1/6. The expression of V beta 11 chains on the surface of spleen cells of mos2 animals was reduced by 33.3%, on the thymocytes even by 50% comparing to that in nonimmunized mice. Whether the reduced expression of T receptor V beta families is due to changes in the genetic material (cDNA), has to be studied.","['Waaga, A M', 'Otte, J M', 'Krzymanski, M', 'Eckstein, V', 'Muller-Ruchholtz, W']","['Waaga AM', 'Otte JM', 'Krzymanski M', 'Eckstein V', 'Muller-Ruchholtz W']","['Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunoblotting/methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'Oncogenes/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1996;44(2-3):89-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From RzPro-expressing HIV-1-infected cells following virus escape, RzPro and target RNA sequences were amplified and checked for cleavage in vitro.

A polymerase chain reaction-based gene amplification method was developed to detect HTLV-I proviral DNA in paraffin-embedded specimens. The specificity of the polymerase chain reaction products was controlled by Southern blot analysis using a nested oligonucleotide probe and by nucleotide sequencing. The nucleophosmin gene and the T-cell receptor-gamma gene were used as controls for the integrity and adequacy of total DNA and T-cell DNA, respectively. This study was conducted with patients referred to an academic medical center. Biopsy specimens were obtained from lesional skin or lymph node from Japanese patients with HTLV-I seropositive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The main outcome measure was the ability to detect HTLV-I pX region proviral DNA. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of DNA extracted from fresh samples of the HTLV-I infected MT4T-cell line demonstrated that formalin fixation and paraffin embedding resulted in a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity of the assay. Nevertheless, HTLV-I pX sequences were still readily detectable in paraffin-embedded samples of MT4 T cells and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma specimens. Both formalin and B5 fixation were suitable for the assay that was 100% specific for HTLV-I-infected tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this method should greatly facilitate investigation of the role of HTLV-I in human diseases by allowing analysis of a wide variety of archival tissue specimens. In addition, the controls designed for the current study can be used in a variety of other polymerase chain reaction-based studies of T cells to ensure against false-negative results caused by DNA degradation or inadequate T-cell density.","['Wood, G S', 'Ruffo, A', 'Salvekar, A', 'Henghold, W', 'Takeshita, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Wood GS', 'Ruffo A', 'Salvekar A', 'Henghold W', 'Takeshita M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Dermatology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1996 Nov;132(11):1339-43.,,,"['AR39750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR40844/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suramin is a more potent (IC50, 0.9 microM) inhibitor of FPGS partially purified from CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells than is bromosulfophthalein (IC50, 17 microM), the first reported nonsubstrate-analog inhibitor of FPGS (J. J. McGuire et al., Adv. Exptl. Med. Biol. 163, 199, 1983). FPGS inhibition by suramin is reversed by bovine serum albumin (which binds suramin). Suramin is a noncompetitive inhibitor with aminopterin (K(ii) = 0.9 microM; K(is) = 1.1 microM) and glutamic acid (K(ii) = 1.0 microM; K(is) = 5.2 microM) as the variable substrates; suramin inhibition tends toward being competitive with respect to the third FPGS substrate, ATP (K(ii) = 3.4 microM; K(is) = 0.35 microM), since the major effect is on its K(m). Suramin is a much less potent inhibitor of two other folate-dependent enzymes, dihydrofolate reductase (IC50, 38 microM; methotrexate (MTX), 0.6 nM) and thymidylate synthase (IC50, 87 microM; MTX, 48 microM). The effects of suramin on growth of CCRF-CEM cells and a MTX-resistant subline (R30dm) expressing low levels of FPGS activity were determined. R30dm is slightly collaterally sensitive to suramin consistent with FPGS inhibition contributing to the cytotoxic mechanism. These data, and those of Rideout et al. (Int. J. Cancer 61, 840, 1995), demonstrating that the reduced folate carrier system of CCRF-CEM is inhibited, suggest that inhibition of folate metabolism could be involved in the mechanism of action of suramin.","['McGuire, J J', 'Haile, W H']","['McGuire JJ', 'Haile WH']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. mcguire@sc3101.med.buffalo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Suramin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(96)90491-9 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1996.0491 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1996 Nov 1;335(1):139-44. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1996.0491.,,,['CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a commercially available affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. By using DAPI as a DNA counterstain and dual wavelength excitation, it was possible to measure enzyme expression in the cell nucleus, and to examine its cell cycle phase distribution. In human acute leukemia cell lines, topoisomerase II alpha expression was greatest in late S and G2 phases, but in leukemia patient samples the enzyme expression appeared to be much less cell cycle dependent. There was considerable interpatient variation in the effects of topotecan on topoisomerase II alpha expression in the leukemia patients, with a threefold increase in the median value after 48 h followed by a decline to pretreatment levels after 5 days of treatment with the topoisomerase I inhibitor. Although these findings should be treated with caution because of the small number of cases studied, they support the prediction that topoisomerase I inhibitors might be capable of increasing sensitivity to topoisomerase II active drugs such as anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins by upregulating topoisomerase II expression. They also illustrate the potential value of fluorescence image cytometry for making sequential measurements of the effects of drug resistance modulating agents in cancer patients.","['Nicklee, T', 'Crump, M', 'Hedley, D W']","['Nicklee T', 'Crump M', 'Hedley DW']","['Department of Oncologic Pathology, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rabbits', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961101)25:3<205::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961101)25:3<205::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-E [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1996 Nov 1;25(3):205-10. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961101)25:3<205::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human lymphatic leukemia cell line HPB-ALL was chemically mutagenized and rare cells expressing constitutively active beta 2-integrin LFA-1 (alpha L beta 2, CD11a/CD18) were selected from the pool of mutagenized cells, by repeated cycles of binding to immobilized ICAM-1. The selected population showed 20-fold more binding to ICAM-1 compared to the starting population. A sub-clone of the selected population, termed HAP4, was further analyzed. In contrast to the original cell line, HAP4 had constitutively active LFA-1 and adherence to ICAM-1 was insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid and cytochalasin B or to inhibition of ATP synthesis. The activation of LFA-1 appeared specific since the cells did not show a general increase in adhesiveness. No major aberration in cell surface carbohydrate expression was found and the expression of cell surface molecules including CD43, CD4, CD8, and MHC class I and II was normal. However, apparent cell surface expression of integrin beta 1 chain was lost and alpha 4 chain was greatly diminished. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of generating cells with mutated adhesive functions and the characterized cells will serve as tools to further dissect the mechanisms underlying integrin regulation.","['Hedman, H', 'Lundgren, E']","['Hedman H', 'Lundgren E']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells', 'Transfection/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/30 00:00,1996/10/30 00:01,['1996/10/30 00:00'],"['1996/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022175996001354 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(96)00135-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1996 Oct 30;198(1):59-66. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(96)00135-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of ATRA at a concentration that induced differentiation in vitro, promotion or supression of differentiation and lineage determination during the differentiation of APL cells involved factors other than ATRA, such as cytokines. Moreover, APL cells that differentiated into monocytoid cells possessed the capability of producing endogenous cytokines such as TNF alpha, which might be involved in the development of ATRA syndrome. Compared to cells from patients without hyperleukocytosis they had a stronger TNF alpha producing capability and lower sensitivity to TGF beta, showing hyperdifferentiation in response to ATRA.

Recently, it was demonstrated that hematopoietic cytokines utilize the gp130 signal transduction pathway to maintain this phenotype, although their involvement toward maintaining porcine ES cell pluripotency has not been established. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of several heterologous hematopoietic cytokines at maintaining the isolated porcine inner cell masses (pICM) in an undifferentiated state. pICMs (day 7) were isolated by immunosurgery and cultured 4 days in one of six treatments: control medium, human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF; 1,000 mu/ml), human interleukin-6 (hIL-6; 100 ng/ml), hIL-6 + hIL-6 soluble receptor (hIL6 + sR; 100 ng/ml + 2.5 micrograms/ml), human oncostatin M (hOSM; 100 ng/ml), or rat ciliary neurotrophic factor (rCNTF; 100 ng/ml). All cytokines were prepared in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F-10 (1:1)-based medium. Morphology of pICMs was evaluated on a scale of 1 (fully undifferentiated) to 5 (fully differentiated) at 24-h intervals. Differentiation was significantly lower on day 2 for rCNTF vs. hLIF cultured pICMs (2.07 +/- 0.15 vs. 2.70 +/- 0.16; P < 0.05). Furthermore, addition of rCNTF gave the lowest overall mean differentiation score (2.53 +/- 0.15). However, none of the cytokines significantly delayed differentiation over controls for the 4-day culture period (P > 0.05). Since these heterologous cytokines were unable to inhibit differentiation, it is unlikely they will be beneficial towards isolating porcine ES cell lines under current conditions. Future work with homologous cytokines and dose effects may prove more beneficial.","['Moore, K', 'Piedrahita, J A']","['Moore K', 'Piedrahita JA']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,['0 (Lymphokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Swine']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199610)45:2<139::AID-MRD5>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199610)45:2<139::AID-MRD5>3.0.CO;2-U [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 1996 Oct;45(2):139-44. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199610)45:2<139::AID-MRD5>3.0.CO;2-U.,,,['R01 HL51587-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ProTNF of primed THP-1 cells had been shown to act as a positive regulator for production of mature TNF by homologous cells (primed THP-1) after LPS stimulation, whereas when THP-1 cells were co-cultivated with NIH3T3 which expressed pro-TNF, production of mature TNF by THP-1 by LPS was significantly suppressed.

Disruption of the PML gene has been shown to be related to acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). To obtain information about the function of PML bodies we have investigated the 3D-distribution of PML bodies in the nucleus of T24 cells and compared it with the spatial distribution of a variety of other nuclear components, using fluorescence dual-labeling immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Results show that PML bodies are not enriched in nascent RNA, the splicing component U2-snRNP, or transcription factors (glucocorticoid receptor, TFIIH, and E2F). These results show that PML bodies are not prominent sites of RNA synthesis or RNA splicing. We found that a large fraction of PML bodies (50 to 80%) is closely associated with DNA replication domains during exclusively middle-late S-phase. Furthermore, in most cells that we analysed we found at least one PML body was tightly associated with a coiled body. In the APL cell line NB4, the PML gene is fused with the RAR alpha gene due to a chromosomal rearrangement. PML bodies have disappeared and the PML antigen, i.e., PML and the PML-RAR fusion protein, is dispersed in a punctated pattern throughout the nucleoplasm. We showed that in NB4 cells the sites that are rich in PML antigen significantly colocalize with sites at which nascent RNA accumulates. This suggests that, in contrast to non-APL cells, in NB4 cells the PML antigen is associated with sites of transcription. The implications of these findings for the function of PML bodies are consistent with the idea that PML bodies are associated with specific genomic loci.","['Grande, M A', 'van der Kraan, I', 'van Steensel, B', 'Schul, W', 'de The, H', 'van der Voort, H T', 'de Jong, L', 'van Driel, R']","['Grande MA', 'van der Kraan I', 'van Steensel B', 'Schul W', 'de The H', 'van der Voort HT', 'de Jong L', 'van Driel R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19961201)63:3<280::AID-JCB3>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19961201)63:3<280::aid-jcb3>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1996 Dec 1;63(3):280-91. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19961201)63:3<280::aid-jcb3>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken in order to measure the inhibition of the proliferation of various sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines, by S16020-2, and to obtain information concerning its mechanism of action. For a continuous exposure, S16020-2 was as cytotoxic as adriamycin (ADR) (mean IC50 of about 28 nM) and on average, 46 fold more potent than elliptinium acetate (ELP), against a panel of 20 non-multidrug resistant cell lines. With a short exposure (1 hour) followed by a post-incubation of 95 hours in drug-free medium, S16020-2 was 5 and 6 fold more cytotoxic than ADR for human lung A549 and murine melanoma B16 cells, respectively. Furthermore, S16020-2 inhibited more actively the formation of colonies issued from proliferating cells, compared to colonies issued from quiescent A549 cells. Because quiescent cells demonstrated a 3 fold lower level of topoisomerase II alpha (topo II) than proliferating cells, these results suggest that this enzyme could be a potential target for S16020-2. In addition, as demonstrated by flow cytometric studies, S16020-2 intercalated into DNA and induced a cell cycle arrest in G2. Cell lines displaying the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, P388/ADR-1, P388/ADR, P388/VCR-20, KB-A1, DC-3F/AD, S1/tMDR, and Colo320DM, were more sensitive to S16020-2 than to ADR or ELP, as shown by the mean resistance factors, 8, 201, and 23 respectively. In addition, the two cell lines displaying the pure classical MDR phenotype, linked exclusively to the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression (P388/VCR-20 and S1/tMDR), were as sensitive to S16020-2 as their sensitive parental counterparts, although they were resistant to ADR. S16020-2 is thus one of the most potent olivacine and ellipticine derivative yet characterized. The good cytotoxicity of S16020-2 against cells displaying a P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance, and its antitumor activity in vivo delineate an important chemotherapeutic potential for this drug.","['Leonce, S', 'Perez, V', 'Casabianca-Pignede, M R', 'Anstett, M', 'Bisagni, E', 'Pierre, A', 'Atassi, G']","['Leonce S', 'Perez V', 'Casabianca-Pignede MR', 'Anstett M', 'Bisagni E', 'Pierre A', 'Atassi G']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale, Institut de Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (S 16020-2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Ethidium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00210788 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(2):169-80. doi: 10.1007/BF00210788.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upregulation of LIF by inflammatory cytokines is usually associated with injury response. We characterized the molecular mechanism of LIF mRNA regulation by IL-1 beta in explanted neonatal rat SCG and a Schwann cell line. IL-1 beta increases LIF mRNA levels by interacting with IL-1 receptors in SCG, since this induction could be diminished by inclusion of either soluble IL-1 receptors or IL-1 receptor antagonist. The antiinflammatory glucocorticoid dexamethasone also inhibits LIF mRNA induction by IL-1 beta. LIF mRNA encodes a 3' AU-rich mRNA stability control sequence, but IL-1 beta does not appear to regulate the decay of LIF mRNA by this mechanism. IL-1 beta does not raise LIF gene transcription rate in cultured SCG 6 or 24 h after addition of IL-1 beta as measured by nuclear run-on assays. LIF gene transcription is induced repidly and transiently in an immortalized Schwann cell line, returning to uninduced rates by 1 h after induction. These results suggest that the IL-1 beta induction of LIF gene expression is at least partially transcriptional, but that LIF mRNA increases to a greater extent than LIF transcription, suggesting the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation as well.","['Carlson, C D', 'Bai, Y', 'Jonakait, G M', 'Hart, R P']","['Carlson CD', 'Bai Y', 'Jonakait GM', 'Hart RP']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'DNA Probes', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genome', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199610)18:2<141::AID-GLIA6>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199610)18:2<141::AID-GLIA6>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Glia. 1996 Oct;18(2):141-51. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199610)18:2<141::AID-GLIA6>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,"['MH 00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 51564/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 30560/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One other patient with a 12p abnormality had evidence for the fusion using FISH which was not detected by RT-PCR.

The diagnoses were refractory anaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. In the child with acute leukaemia, the CT8M was diagnosed at birth due to severe dysmorphisms and malformations; the other two patients showed a milder phenotype, and the CT8M was diagnosed only after the finding of trisomy 8 in neoplastic cells. The review of eight similar, previously reported cases and the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies performed in our patients led us to make the following observations: (I) CT8M predisposes to neoplasms, preferentially to myelo- or lymphoproliferative diseases; (2) a gene dosage effect for glutathione reductase in red blood cells was seen in two of our patients; (3) the wide phenotypic variation of CT8M was confirmed: trisomy 8 in neoplastic cells of phenotypically near-normal cases may be misinterpreted as acquired; and (4) molecular studies suggested a postzygotic origin of the trisomy in our three cases, with the supernumerary chromosome being of paternal origin in one case and of maternal origin in the other two. We postulate that the trisomy 8 in neoplasms may often occur by mitotic nondisjunction in an early embryonic multipotent cell and that what is usually interpreted as an acquired trisomy 8 may in fact be CT8M. The constitutional trisomy 8 would act as a pathogenetically important first mutation in multistep carcinogenesis.

In order to characterize P-gp-mifepristone interactions in human tumoral cells, we have studied the effect of the antiprogestatin agent on P-gp activity in human CD34+ leukemic cells known to display high levels of P-gp-related drug efflux. P-gp-mediated transport of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 occurring in the CD34+ KG1a myeloid leukemia cell line was found to be strongly inhibited by mifepristone in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly to verapamil, a well-known chemosensitizer agent, the antiprogestatin drug increased doxorubicin cytotoxicity in KG1a cells. Mifepristone, when used at a 10 microM concentration thought to be achievable in vivo without major toxicity, was also able to markedly decrease cellular rhodamine 123 efflux occurring in CD34+ blast cells isolated from six patients suffering from myeloid acute leukemias.

A PMEA-resistant K562 cell line (designated K562/PMEA-1) was selected in the presence of escalating PMEA concentrations. This cell line proved to be insensitive to the induction of erythroid differentiation by PMEA. It also was 108-fold resistant to the cytostatic effects of PMEA. The K562/PMEA-1 cells showed reduced sensitivity to the differentiation-inducing capacity and cytostatic activity of several closely related PMEA analogs. Furthermore, the mutant cells exhibited a decreased sensitivity to the differentiation-inducing activity of a wide variety of structurally nonrelated antimetabolites targeted at different enzymes of nucleotide biosynthesis. A 5-25-fold higher concentration of each of these compounds was required to obtain the same level of differentiation in the K562/PMEA-1 cells as in the wild-type cells. However, unlike the PMEA derivatives, the antimetabolites remained equally cytostatic for the mutant K562 cells and for the wild-type cells. Our results reveal two unique features of the K562/PMEA-1 cells: (i) specific resistance to both the differentiation-inducing and cytostatic effects of several acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogs (which can be accounted for by a diminished cellular uptake and subsequent metabolism of the compounds) and (ii) nonspecific resistance to antimetabolites with regard to their differentiation-inducing, but not cytostatic, properties (which must reside in an unspecified alteration of a common site of the differentiation process that is shared by all of these antimetabolites).","['Hatse, S', 'De Clercq, E', 'Balzarini, J']","['Hatse S', 'De Clercq E', 'Balzarini J']","['Laboratory of Virology and Experimental Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6GQP90I798 (adefovir)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'Organophosphonates/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 Nov;50(5):1231-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The loss in mtDNA was associated with a delayed loss in mitochondrial function. Here, we report that the 4-quinolone drug ciprofloxacin is cytotoxic to a variety of cultured mammalian cell lines at concentrations that deplete cells of mtDNA. The IC50 values for ciprofloxacin varied from 40 to 80 micrograms/ml depending on the cell line tested. Cytotoxicity required continuous exposure of cells to drug for 2-4 days, which corresponded to approximately three or four cell doublings. Shorter times of drug exposure did not cause significant cytotoxicity. In addition, cells became drug resistant when they were grown under conditions that bypassed the need for mitochondrial respiration. Resistance was not due to a decrease in cellular drug accumulation, suggesting that ciprofloxacin cytotoxicity is caused by the loss of mtDNA-encoded functions. Analysis of mtDNA from ciprofloxacin-treated cells revealed the presence of site-specific, double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, exonuclease protection studies indicated that the 5'-, but not the 3'-, ends of the drug-induced DNA breaks were tightly associated with protein.

The nuclear signalling pathways of RA and D3 are mediated through their cognate receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), respectively. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) is an auxiliary factor that forms a heterodimer with RAR and VDR, enabling their efficient transcriptional activation. 9-cis RA, a high-affinity ligand for RXR, greatly enhanced D3-induced CD14 expression in U937 cells, while RA alone did not induce CD14 expression. 9-cis RA also resulted in morphological changes of U937 cells to macrophage-like cells when combined with D3, while RA alone resulted in granulocyte-like cells. RA and D3 together enhanced c-fms expression, phagocytic activity, and acted synergistically to promote nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activity and inhibit proliferation. Northern analysis showed that U937 cells constitutively expressed RAR-alpha, VDR and RXR-alpha mRNAs. RA or D3 alone or in combination did not affect RAR-alpha and VDR expression, while 9-cis RA and 9-cis RA plus all-trans RA significantly reduced RXR-alpha expression. Interestingly, D3 could restore the down-regulation of RXR-alpha mRNA by 9-cis RA. These findings suggest that there is crossover of the nuclear signalling pathways of RA and D3. This may have clinical implications in that RA and D3 may be used in combination for differentiation-inducing therapy in acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Nakajima, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Ueno, H', 'Muto, A', 'Takayama, N', 'Matsushita, H', 'Sonoda, A', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Nakajima H', 'Kizaki M', 'Ueno H', 'Muto A', 'Takayama N', 'Matsushita H', 'Sonoda A', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00020-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00020-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Aug;20(8):665-76. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00020-3.,,,,,,['Leuk Res. 1997 Feb;21(2):173-6.

The supposed mixed erythroid/megakaryocytic nature of these cells has been investigated further by challenging MELCs with the antimicrotubule agent colcemid. This compound, at the concentration of 40 nM, was found to induce a striking arrest of cell growth without significant effects on viability. At the same time, the bulk of treated MELCs underwent a large increase in size to contain, after 3 days, as much as 4 times more proteins and 5 times more DNA than controls. As shown by high rates of 3H-thymidine incorporation, increase in DNA content was the result of active synthesis without completion of intervening mitosis according to a process that closely resembled endoreplication. Eventually, colcemidinduced MELCs presented multilobed nuclei and were arranged into discrete ploidy groups containing up to 16 N levels of DNA. Moreover, upon colcemid addition, MELCs initiated a polyploid response that was shown to continue, even in the absence of the inducer, to yield cells that became strongly positive for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the late stages of culture. These effects were compatible with a colcemid-induced commitment of MELCs to megakaryocyte differentiation, for which these cells seemed to be definitely programmed. The expression of megakaryocyte features in MELCs provided further evidence for the bipotentiality (erythroid/megakaryocytic) of this model.","['Paoletti, F', 'Mocali, A', 'Cellai, C', 'Caporale, R', 'Vannucchi, A M']","['Paoletti F', 'Mocali A', 'Cellai C', 'Caporale R', 'Vannucchi AM']","['Istituto di Patologia Generale, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Demecolcine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Ploidies', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Oct;24(12):1441-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that the Fv-4 resistant (Fv-4r) gene product, Fv-4r env antigen, is released from Fv-4r-bearing BALB/c-Fv-4Wr (C4W) mouse-derived cells into serum in vivo and binds to cells expressing surface receptors for ecotropic MuLV, thereby protecting them from infection with Friend leukemia virus (FLV) by receptor interference. This unique resistance mechanism against retroviral infection might provide a possible therapeutic model system of human retroviral infection such as AIDS. To further investigate the Fv-4r gene action in vivo, we examined the distribution and character of Fv-4r env antigen in serum and systemic organs from C4W mice. The Fv-4r env antigen was immunohistochemically localized to the lympho-hematopoietic cells and exocrine glandular cells, such as those of the salivary gland and pancreas. Using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, we determined two types of gp70-related Fv-4r env antigen in the serum of C4W mice, showing molecular weights of either 70-75 kDa and 80-85 kDa. When thymocytes from Fv-4 susceptible gene (Fv-4r)-bearing C3H mouse were mixed with C4W mouse serum, the 70-75k Da molecule of the C4W serum dominantly bound to C3H thymocytes and thus contributed to receptor interference function. Using immunoelectron microscopy, Fv-4r env antigen was mainly localized to the cell surface membrane of thymic lymphoid cells, while acinar cells of the salivary gland possessed Fv-4r env antigen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as on the cell surface membrane. These data indicate that several glandular organs, as well as lymphohematopoietic organs of C4W mice, may contribute to the production of cell-free Fv-4r env antigen, resulting in protection of cells from infection with FLV by receptor interference.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Sado, T', 'Ikeda, H', 'Hirokawa, K']","['Kitagawa M', 'Aizawa S', 'Kamisaku H', 'Sado T', 'Ikeda H', 'Hirokawa K']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Oct;24(12):1423-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of JNK1 peaked at 4 h of treatment (about ten-fold over the control), and was sustained up to 5 h post-treatment. This induction preceded the onset of apoptosis, as determined by morphological features and internucleosomal degradation of DNA. Upon treatment of cells with JNK1-inducing doses, ADR caused an elevation of steady-state levels of c-jun and ATF3 mRNAs, as measured by RT-PCR. In contrast, the activity of ERK 1/2 remained unchanged throughout the treatments, indicating that members of MAPK family are differentially regulated in ADR-treated cells.

Human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells undergo apoptotic cell death when cells are treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and etoposide. The induction of the actin cleavage activity accompanied the development of apoptosis. ICE/ced-3 family protease inhibitors such as Z-VAD-CH2DCB and Z-EVD-CH2DCB at 100 microg/ml prevented both the emergence of ACA and the morphological change, characteristics of apoptosis, in cisplatin-treated OVCAR-3 cells. The ACA in apoptotic OVCAR-3 cell lysate was greatly adsorbed by antibody against CPP-32, an ICE family protease. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated CPP-32 from OVCAR-3 lysate could cleave actin to generate a 15-kDa fragment, as did the apoptotic OVCAR-3 cell lysate, indicating that CPP-32 is a major protease responsible for the ACA. The activation of CPP-32 in the drug-treated cell lysate was verified with Western blot analysis.

These analyses revealed a striking correlation with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) and 2,2'-O-cyclocytidine sensitivity in the cell lines harboring ras mutations compared to the tumor lines with wild-type ras alleles. Strong correlations were also found with topoisomerase (topo) II inhibitors, especially 3'-hydroxydaunorubicin and an olivacine derivative. These differential sensitivities persisted in an additional 22 non-small cell lung carcinoma lines (ras mutations, n = 12 and wild-type ras, n = 10). Thus, the association with Ara-C sensitivity was greatest while topo II inhibitors showed a lower, but significant, correlation. These results suggest that the ras oncogene may play a determinant role in rendering tumor cells sensitive to deoxycytidine analogues and topo II inhibitors.","['Koo, H M', 'Monks, A', 'Mikheev, A', 'Rubinstein, L V', 'Gray-Goodrich, M', 'McWilliams, M J', 'Alvord, W G', 'Oie, H K', 'Gazdar, A F', 'Paull, K D', 'Zarbl, H', 'Vande Woude, G F']","['Koo HM', 'Monks A', 'Mikheev A', 'Rubinstein LV', 'Gray-Goodrich M', 'McWilliams MJ', 'Alvord WG', 'Oie HK', 'Gazdar AF', 'Paull KD', 'Zarbl H', 'Vande Woude GF']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Software', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Nov 15;56(22):5211-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human pathology, the TAL-1 gene product is expressed in a high percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range; however, it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis. In this report, we describe the phenotype of mouse transgenic lines obtained by inducing tal-1 protein expression in lymphoid tissues using the LCK promoter. The survival rate of tal-1 transgenic animals was much lower as compared with control mice. Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T-cell type, often comprising a minor B-cell component. Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion. Primary lymphocyte cultures showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low-serum apoptosis. To further unravel the tal-1 oncogenic potential, a strain of tal-1 transgenic mice was crossbred with p53-/- mice; the survival rate in these animals was reduced by more than one-half when compared with that of tal-1 mice, and histopathological analysis revealed exclusively T-cell lymphomas. These data indicate that TAL-1, expressed in T cells, is per se a potent oncogene, which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.","['Condorelli, G L', 'Facchiano, F', 'Valtieri, M', 'Proietti, E', 'Vitelli, L', 'Lulli, V', 'Huebner, K', 'Peschle, C', 'Croce, C M']","['Condorelli GL', 'Facchiano F', 'Valtieri M', 'Proietti E', 'Vitelli L', 'Lulli V', 'Huebner K', 'Peschle C', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E2 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'Phenotype', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Nov 15;56(22):5113-9.,,,"['CA21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition was very obvious in NRK-49F and AtT-20 cells, but it was almost negligible in HL-60 cells. There was no difference in terms of the binding of 12-HETE to NRK-49F and HL-60 cells. Pretreatment of NRK-49F cells with pertussis toxin almost completely ADP-ribosylated Gi proteins, but it did not affect the inhibition of 12-HETE on AC in this cell. This result excludes the involvement of Gi proteins in 12-HETE-mediated inhibition of AC. It was revealed that the characteristics of ACs in these cells were quite different in response to agonists and forskolin, suggesting that these cells do have different isoform of AC.

Sequencing revealed that one of these genes, which was approximately 1.7 kb and which encoded a protein of 320 amino acids, was identical to hnRNP A1. The other was a novel gene of about 2.2 kb encoding a protein of 469 amino acids. These genes were also down-regulated in the cells incubated with camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces DNA single strand breaks, but not in those exposed to ICRF-154, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that does not induce DNA cleavable complex formation.

This paper describes a novel protein named the anthracycline resistance associated (ARA) protein. The ara gene is amplified in the MDR leukaemia line CCRF-CEM/E1000 and its mRNA is overexpressed. ARA belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. Another ABC protein, the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), has previously been reported to be overexpressed in the CEM/E1000 subline. The primary amino acid sequence of ARA indicates that it is 49.5 kDa without glycosylation, and that it has one potential glycosylation site. ARA has one ATP binding site and associated transmembrane regions. This is in contrast to MRP (190 kDa, 172 kDa deglycosylated) and most other higher eukaryote ABC proteins, which consist of two similar halves, each having one ATP binding site. In addition to ARA being coexpressed with MRP, comparison of amino acid sequences showed that, among known proteins, ARA is most similar to the C-terminal half of MRP.","['Longhurst, T J', ""O'Neill, G M"", 'Harvie, R M', 'Davey, R A']","['Longhurst TJ', ""O'Neill GM"", 'Harvie RM', 'Davey RA']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ABCC6 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.545 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Nov;74(9):1331-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.545.,PMC2074757,,,"['GENBANK/L05628', 'GENBANK/X95715']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When administered to a patient this combination should result in selective irradiation of the target tumour cells with relative sparing of normal tissues. Simple ions and small molecules which follow physiological pathways as either the natural substrates or analogues form the best examples of biological targeting. Clinically valuable results are seen with, for instance, iodine uptake by normal and malignant thyroid cells, incorporation of the calci-mimetic element strontium in areas of increased bone metabolism and accumulation of the catecholamine analogue meta-iodobenzylguanidine in neuroblastoma. The use of monoclonal antibodies as targeting vehicles has not proved to be a panacea, yet some patients with lymphoma, hepatoma and ovarian carcinoma have obtained benefit. Current clinical studies in targeted radiotherapy focus on the integration of radionuclide treatment with conventional treatments, and the optimization of such combined approaches. The development of modifications to offset the limitations inherent in the use of crude antibodies also offers an opportunity for improved clinical outcomes.","['Gaze, M N']",['Gaze MN'],"['Meyerstein Institute of Oncology, Middlesex Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodobenzenes)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Iodobenzenes/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neuroblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Palliative Care', 'Polycythemia/radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/radiotherapy']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/41/10/003 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 1996 Oct;41(10):1895-903. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/41/10/003.,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two main sources of the enzyme, E. coli and Erwinia. Faced with increasing reports of treatment complications, we established a programme to monitor enzyme activity and asparagine levels in serum, in children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Trough asparagine and asparaginase levels were measured in 49 children on induction treatment with different E. coli preparations (Asparaginase medac, Crasnitin) and in 52 children on re-induction (Asparaginase medac, Crasnitin, and, in the event of allergic reactions, Erwinase) just prior to each sequential application of 10000 U/m2 of asparaginase. Measurements were made by an enzyme assay and an HPLC method. During induction, both Escherichia coli preparations induced the desired reduction in asparagine, but the asparaginase activity with Asparaginase medac was significantly higher than with Crasnitin (median of trough levels 475 versus 74 U/l). Under re-induction treatment (median, Asparaginase medac 528 U/l, Crasnitin 49 U/l, and Erwinase < 20 U/l) complete asparagine depletion was recorded on day 3 in more than 90% of Asparaginase medac samples, more than 60% of Crasnitin samples and in 26% of Erwinase samples. The latter two groups included some children with unchanged asparagine levels and no measurable enzyme activity. Different asparaginase preparations are not readily interchangeable. When Asparaginase medac is used instead of Crasnitin, and identical dose will be associated with significantly higher enzyme activity, well above the level required for complete asparagine depletion. Clinical studies will need to specify both the preparation and the dose to be used.

Immunological characteristics of this region were investigated further using a peptide corresponding to the middle of the putative FIV V3 loop. The peptide was recognized in ELISA by sera from the majority of naturally FIV-infected cats, and absorbed a significant fraction of the virus neutralizing activity from a pool of sera of cats naturally infected with FIV, confirming the immunogenic nature of this region. A sheep immunized with an octameric form of the peptide (multiple antigenic peptide; MAP) in Freund's complete adjuvant generated neutralizing antibody to a higher titre than infected cats. However, immunization of cats with the same MAP in an acceptable adjuvant formulation (Quil A) induced antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses to the immunizing peptides but only minimal neutralizing activity. These responses did not significantly alter the kinetics of infection or the proviral load after challenge with a homologous strain of FIV, compared with naive controls. While the potential efficacy of peptide vaccines to lentiviruses remains to be determined, this study shows that the immune response evoked may be highly dependent on the delivery and adjuvant regime used.","['Rigby, M A', 'Mackay, N', 'Reid, G', 'Osborne, R', 'Neil, J C', 'Jarrett, O']","['Rigby MA', 'Mackay N', 'Reid G', 'Osborne R', 'Neil JC', 'Jarrett O']","['MRC Retrovirus Research Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Cats', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Receptors, Virus/*immunology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sheep', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Viral Load']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0264-410X(96)00060-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0264-410x(96)00060-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1996 Aug;14(12):1095-102. doi: 10.1016/0264-410x(96)00060-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crypt contains abundant replicating cells which, upon reaching the villus tip, acquire their fully differentiated state. Besides its well recognized role in bone cell homeostasis, calcitriol has been attributed a role in cellular differentiation and proliferation in normal leukocytes and myeloid leukemia cells. We have previously documented the presence and the distribution of specific calcitriol receptors in the cells of the small and large intestine from 13-20-wk-old human fetuses and that calcitriol was able to promote human intestinal epithelium proliferation or differentiation, in organ culture, depending upon fetal age. We now show that, whereas transcripts for calcitriol receptors are abundant from duodenum to colon, those for the 9-kD calcium-binding protein are present mainly in the duodenum and the jejunum and to a lesser extent in the ileum and the colon. Transcripts for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-24-hydroxylase could not be detected in any of the intestine segments despite a prolonged exposition of the gels. Immunofluorescence staining for the 9-kD calcium-binding protein was exclusively observed in the epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon, the subepithelial layers being always negative. The 9-kD calcium-binding protein distribution along the crypt-villus axis appeared as a gradient, increasing from the developing crypt to the tip of the villus in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Based on the present observations and on the fact that calcitriol promotes human fetal proliferation and differentiation, the presence of transcripts for calcitriol receptors and 9-kD calcium-binding protein in the intestinal cell opens interesting possibilities as of their role in the in utero human gut development and the control of colorectal cancers.","['Delvin, E E', 'Lopez, V', 'Levy, E', 'Menard, D']","['Delvin EE', 'Lopez V', 'Levy E', 'Menard D']","[""Centre de recherche de l'Hopital Ste-Justine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Colon/embryology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestine, Small/embryology/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/*metabolism', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199611000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1996 Nov;40(5):664-70. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199611000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of IRS-2 as a signaling molecule for GH is further demonstrated by the finding that GH stimulates association of IRS-2 with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.

None of the reported purification procedures worked properly for our P-glycoprotein-overproducing cell lines, i.e. murine lymphoid leukemia P388/ADR25, rat hepatoma AS30-D/COL10, and human lymphoblastic leukemia CEM/VLB5 cells. We have thus developed a general procedure for efficient purification of P-glycoprotein by combining solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate and chromatography on ceramic hydroxyapatite. This procedure was successful for the three cell lines and yielded 70% of the P-glycoprotein present in the starting plasma membranes with more than 99% purity. After exchanging sodium dodecyl sulfate into dodecyl maltoside and reconstitution into liposomes, purified P-glycoprotein exhibited a specific ATPase activity of about 200 nmol/min/mg, which was very similar to that obtained for P-glycoprotein solubilized and purified with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

The subunit association and DNA binding properties of the NF-Y complex were examined as a function of redox state using recombinant NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. Reduction of NF-YB by dithiothreitol (DTT) was essential for reconstitution of specific NF-Y CCAAT box DNA binding activity in vitro. Approximately 30% of the Escherichia coli-derived NF-YB subunit existed as intermolecular disulfide-linked dimers. NF-YB mutants in which the highly conserved cysteine residues at positions 85 and 89 had been converted to serines existed only as monomers and did not require DTT for functional NF-Y DNA binding activity. DTT was required, however, for the functional association of NF-YC with wild-type NF-YB but not with the NF-YB cysteine mutants. The cellular redox factors Ref-1 and adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor stimulated the DNA binding activity of recombinant NF-Y in the absence of DTT. Cells treated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, an irreversible inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, exhibited reduced endogenous NF-Y DNA binding activity. Together these results suggest that the cellular redox environment of mammalian cells is an important posttranscriptional regulator of NF-Y subunit association and DNA binding activities.","['Nakshatri, H', 'Bhat-Nakshatri, P', 'Currie, R A']","['Nakshatri H', 'Bhat-Nakshatri P', 'Currie RA']","['Laboratory of Gene Regulation, The Picower Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA. racurrie@picower.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biopolymers', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.46.28784 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)34996-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 15;271(46):28784-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.46.28784.,,,['DK 47272/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/U62296', 'GENBANK/U62297']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This motif plays a critical role in receptor-mediated signal transduction. Synthetic peptides based on the ITAM sequences of the beta and gamma subunits of FcepsilonRI were used to investigate which proteins associate with these motifs. Tyrosine-phosphorylated beta and gamma ITAM peptides immobilized on beads precipitated Syk, Lyn, Shc, Grb2, and phospholipase C-gamma1 from lysates of rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Syk was precipitated predominantly by the tyrosine-diphosphorylated gamma ITAM peptide, but much less by the diphosphorylated beta ITAM peptide or by the monophosphorylated peptides. Phospholipase C-gamma1, Shc, and Grb2 were precipitated only by the diphosphorylated beta ITAM peptide. Non-phosphorylated ITAM peptides did not precipitate these proteins. In membrane binding assays, fusion proteins containing the Src homology 2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma1, Shc, Syk, and Lyn directly bound the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM peptides. Although the ITAM sequences of the beta and gamma subunits of FcepsilonRI are similar, once they are tyrosine-phosphorylated they preferentially bind different downstream signaling molecules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM of the gamma subunit recruits and activates Syk, whereas the beta subunit may be important for the Ras signaling pathway.","['Kimura, T', 'Kihara, H', 'Bhattacharyya, S', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Appella, E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Kimura T', 'Kihara H', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Sakamoto H', 'Appella E', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. tk51w@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Type C Phospholipases/chemistry/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.44.27962 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35327-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 1;271(44):27962-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.44.27962.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This serpin, proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9), has an unusual reactive center P1(Glu)-P1'(Cys), which suggests that it inhibits serine proteinases that cleave after acidic residues. The only known serine proteinase with this specificity is granzyme B, a granule cytotoxin produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes. To test the interaction of PI-9 with granzyme B we prepared recombinant hexa-histidine tagged PI-9 in a yeast expression system. Addition of the recombinant protein to native granzyme B resulted in an SDS-resistant complex typical of serpin-serine proteinase interactions. Further analysis showed that complex formation followed bimolecular kinetics with a second order rate constant of 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, which is in the range for a physiologically significant serpin-proteinase interaction. Recombinant PI-9 also completely abrogated granzyme B and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Examination of PI-9 mRNA distribution demonstrated that it is expressed in immune tissue, primarily in lymphocytes. The highest levels of PI-9 mRNA and protein were observed in natural killer cell leukemia cell lines and in interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which also produce granzyme B. Like PI-6, PI-9 was shown to be a cytosolic protein that is not secreted. Fractionation of natural killer cells and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that PI-9 is in a separate subcellular compartment to granzyme B. These results suggest that PI-9 serves to inactivate misdirected granzyme B following cytotoxic cell degranulation. This may explain why cytotoxic cells are not damaged by their own granzyme B during destruction of abnormal cells.","['Sun, J', 'Bird, C H', 'Sutton, V', 'McDonald, L', 'Coughlin, P B', 'De Jong, T A', 'Trapani, J A', 'Bird, P I']","['Sun J', 'Bird CH', 'Sutton V', 'McDonald L', 'Coughlin PB', 'De Jong TA', 'Trapani JA', 'Bird PI']","['Department of Medicine, Monash Medical School, Box Hill Hospital, Box Hill 3128, Australia. philb@boxhill.med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SERPINB9 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serpins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Viral Proteins']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.44.27802 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35305-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 1;271(44):27802-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.44.27802.,,,,['GENBANK/U71364'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cultured line of human leukemic T cells, termed HSB.2, co-expresses a total of 7282 +/- 1805 EP3, EP4, and EP2 Rs per cell with a Kd of 3.7 +/- 1.4 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 9). The EP3/EP1 R-selective agonist sulprostone, EP3/EP2/EP4 R-selective agonists M&B 28767 and misoprostol, and EP2 R-selective agonist butaprost but not the EP1 R-selective antagonist SC-19220 competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]PGE2 to HSB.2 cells. Stimulation of increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) by PGE2, misoprostol, and butaprost and of increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) by PGE2 and sulprostone demonstrated the respective involvement of EP2/EP4 Rs and EP3 Rs in transduction of biochemical signals. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was identified by zymography and Western blots as the principal MMP secreted by HSB.2 cells. The cytosolic level and secretion of MMP-9 were increased maximally after 24 h of incubation of HSB.2 cells with 10(-8)-10(-6) M PGE2, sulprostone, M&B 28767, and misoprostol but not with 10(-6) M PGF2alpha, PGD2, PGI2, or butaprost, suggesting a principal dependence on EP3 Rs. That stimulation of MMP-9 secretion by PGE2 was not diminished in Ca2+-free medium but was suppressed significantly and dose-dependently by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase, suggested that MMP-9 expression by HSB.2 cells is mediated by increases in [Ca2+]i attributable to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The lack of effect of dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and SQ 22536, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, on MMP-9 secretion by HSB.2 cells argued against any role for cAMP-dependent mechanisms linked to EP2/EP4 Rs. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D, which respectively inhibited protein and RNA synthesis, suppressed basal and PGE2 induction of MMP-9 production by HSB.2 cells. Northern analysis indicated that PGE2 and sulprostone time-dependently increased expression of MMP-9 mRNA. Thus, stimulation of MMP-9 in HSB.2 T cells by PGE2 is attributable to [Ca2+]i-dependent EP3 R-mediation of increases in message transcription.","['Zeng, L', 'An, S', 'Goetzl, E J']","['Zeng L', 'An S', 'Goetzl EJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94143-0711, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins E, Synthetic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', '0E43V0BB57 (Misoprostol)', '17318-31-9 (9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)-adenine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '501Q5EQ1GM (sulprostone)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '80558-61-8 (11-deoxy-16-phenoxy-17,18,19,20-tetranorprostaglandin E1)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'HP16WVP23Y (butaprost)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Alprostadil/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Misoprostol/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins E, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/drug effects/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.44.27744 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35296-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 1;271(44):27744-50. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.44.27744.,,,['HL 31809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS: 235 outpatients who underwent 264 autologous bone marrow harvests. Patients are candidates for autologous bone marrow harvesting on an outpatient basis if they are Karnofsky performance status of 80-100 and ASA status I, II or III. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of perioperative complications and hospital admission from the Surgical Day Hospital, the duration of the harvesting procedure and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, details of the postoperative pain management, and costs and charges of the outpatient procedure compared with the same procedure performed on inpatients were assessed. Mean age was 37.7 years +/- 10.5 SD; + 7.7% patients were male and 52.3% were female. The disease process included non-Hodgkin's lymph/ma (30.3%), leukemia (24.3%), metastatic breast cancer (18.4%), Hodgkin's disease (17.3%), testicular carcinoma (6.5%) and other (1.6%). The patients were ASA status II (54.5%) or ASA III (45.5%) and received general endotracheal anesthesia. Each patient had 10.7 ml/kg +/- 2.8 SD of marrow harvested over a period of 110.7 minutes + 30.4 SD and total recovery room time of 233.7 minutes +/- 85.5 SD. Of 251 harvest, only three (1.1%) required hospital admission. PACU complaints included transient hypotension and dizziness (5.3%), nausea (3.8%), vomiting (3.4%), and (1.9%) temperature elevation. 83.7% of patients were reached at home the following day and 4.1% complained of nausea and/or vomiting at home. 6.8% of patients experienced temperature elevation at home. Only 27.1% of patients took the acetaminophen with codeine that was prescribed. The reminder required no opioid at home. Outpatient charge/ inpatient charge was 51.1%, and outpatient cost/inpatient was 74.4%. CONCLUSION: Autologous bone marrow harvesting is an acceptable ambulatory surgical procedure that results in a very law postanesthesia complication rate. Postoperative pain is easily controlled.

We cannot sum up the bioeffects of EMF in a few words, for these are attributed to frequency difference. This review discusses the bioeffects of EMF ranging from frequency of microwave to static magnetic field with main stress on the socalled non-thermal effects below radiofrequency band. Non-thermal effects are rather weak compared with those of high frequency band and have been treated as unknown matter for a long period. However, as the EMF energy has come to be increasingly used at high levels, we can now clearly detect the bioeffects of induced eddy currents. On the other hand, some findings about low level ELF electromagnetic field suspected as a cancer-promoting factor are mainly gained by epidemiological method. Cancer researchers concerned with recent powerline issues are coming up with many reports on oncological effects of very low-level (0.1 microT order) ELF electromagnetic fields. More data, however, should be collected to reach appropriate conclusion about the possibility of low level ELF electromagnetic fields have an effect of cancer promotion. As for the safety standards of static magnetic field it should be noted that in 1993 National Radiation Protection Board (UK) and International Radiation Protection Association published the highest values ever recommended. These announcements would agree with our assumption that biological processes require high flux density of ELF-EMF proportional to 1/f, where frequency and flux density are indicated with a logarithmic function.","['Nakagawa, M']",['Nakagawa M'],"['Railway Technical Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi,Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,9507473,,IM,"['Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Safety']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi. 1996 Jan;38(1):1-10.,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence and describe the clinical spectrum of acute polyneuropathy associated with HDAC therapy for leukemia. METHODS: Records of 153 acute leukemia patients who received 194 courses of HDAC at the City of Hope were reviewed for evidence of severe peripheral neuropathy with onset 2-3 weeks after HDAC therapy. RESULTS: Two patients were identified who developed motor disability 2-3 weeks after HDAC therapy, and the disability progressed in a monophasic course to quadriparesis. There was neurophysiologic evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination with slowed nerve conduction velocities and conduction block. One patient who was autopsied had demyelination identified in luxol-fast blue sections of peripheral nerve (with Bielschowsky-stained sections showing intact peripheral nerve axons). There were foamy macrophages in the peripheral nerve but no chronic inflammatory cells. For comparison, data from these two patients were combined with those from four published case reports of polyneuropathy associated with HDAC therapy. Quadriparesis occurred in five of six cases with the need for ventilatory support in four. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was elevated in five of six cases. Etiologic evidence incriminating HDAC included simultaneous cerebellar signs in two of six cases and a narrow interval of clinical onset after HDAC therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Demyelinating polyneuropathy occurs in approximately 1% of HDAC courses and produces severe motor disability. HDAC immunosuppression could trigger an immune-mediated neuropathy; alternatively, a direct neurotoxic effect of HDAC on Schwann cells is also an etiologic possibility.","['Openshaw, H', 'Slatkin, N E', 'Stein, A S', 'Hinton, D R', 'Forman, S J']","['Openshaw H', 'Slatkin NE', 'Stein AS', 'Hinton DR', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Neurology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Durate, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cerebellar Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Demyelinating Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961101)78:9<1899::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Nov 1;78(9):1899-905.,,,"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that bone marrow mast cells are clearly identifiable on the basis of their light-scatter properties and strong CD117 expression. These cells were negative for the CD34, CD38, and BB4 antigens. In addition, they were CD33+ and displayed a high reactivity for the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody. The identity of the CD117-strong+ cells (mast cells) was confirmed by both microscopic examination and flow cytometry analysis. The overall frequency of mast cells in the bone marrow samples analyzed in the present study was constantly lower than 1%. The lowest frequencies corresponded to normal human bone marrow samples (0.0080 +/- 0.0082%) and the highest to those patients suffering from indolent systemic mast cell disease (0.40 +/- 0.13%). In summary, our results show that the identification and enumeration of bone marrow mast cells can be achieved using multiparametric flow cytometry. Moreover, once identified, mast cells are suitable for being characterized from the phenotypic and the functional point of view, facilitating the comparison between normal and abnormal mast cells.","['Orfao, A', 'Escribano, L', 'Villarrubia, J', 'Velasco, J L', 'Cervero, C', 'Ciudad, J', 'Navarro, J L', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Orfao A', 'Escribano L', 'Villarrubia J', 'Velasco JL', 'Cervero C', 'Ciudad J', 'Navarro JL', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio Central de Citometria, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Separation', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/*pathology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Nov;149(5):1493-9.,PMC1865253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGJ2 inhibited the growth of both human PL-21 myeloid leukemia and RC-K8 pre-B lymphoma cells in culture in a dose-dependent manner with fragmentation of nucleus and formation of apoptotic body. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed DNA ladder formation in the cells treated with PGJ2. Furthermore, PGJ2 induced a rapid and transient expression of apoptosis-related protooncogene, c-fos, in both cells. The gene transcriptional rate was remarkably increased approximately 3.3-fold in PGJ2 treated cells, but the stability of c-fos mRNA was not significantly changed. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide increased c-fos mRNA stability but not abrogated PGJ2-induced c-fos transcription.

Toxoplasmosis is the most frequent cause of posterior uveitis (43%) and of uveitis in childhood (12%); involvement is bilateral in 50-60% of cases. Diffuse uveitis forms are uncommon in children, but their course is particularly severe. They may either be the natural evolution of a posterior uveitis or the presenting sign of a systemic disease typical of the third decade of life, such as sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's disease.

We conclude that the use of recombinant human growth factors is potentially an effective way of increasing the MI in bone marrow cultures from APL patients for the purposes of diagnosis and residual disease detection.","['Williams, B', 'Allan, D J']","['Williams B', 'Allan DJ']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Mater Adult Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mitotic Index/*drug effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460896001550 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00155-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Oct 1;91(1):77-81. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00155-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulation of sphingosine kinase activity in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells was investigated by treatment with several bioactive agents. Treatment of HEL cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in sphingosine kinase activity measured in vitro. Sphingosine kinase activity increased in a phorbol ester- and diacylglycerol-specific manner. Staurosporine and calphostin C, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, blocked the increased in sphingosine kinase activity, suggesting a PKC-dependent regulation. The effects of PMA on sphingosine kinase were dependent on transcription and translation. Purified PKC had no direct effect on sphingosine kinase activity. However, these studies led to the observation that HEL cell sphingosine kinase activity is stimulated in vitro by phosphatidylserine. Interestingly, other inducers of HEL cell differentiation, dimethylsulfoxide and retinoic acid, did not affect sphingosine kinase activity. These results indicate a separate and distinct pathway of PKC-dependent sphingosine kinase activation, and suggest a role for sphingosine kinase in regulation of cell function.","['Buehrer, B M', 'Bardes, E S', 'Bell, R M']","['Buehrer BM', 'Bardes ES', 'Bell RM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/18 00:00,1996/10/18 00:01,['1996/10/18 00:00'],"['1996/10/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(96)00092-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(96)00092-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Oct 18;1303(3):233-42. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(96)00092-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the mechanisms by which HTLV-I Tax protein induces phenotypic changes in PC12 cells. We demonstrated that the HTLV-I Tax gene induces epithelioid changes and increases cell-cell contact in PC12 cells. No change in the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule was observed between HTLV-I Tax-expressing PC12 cells and PC12 cells transfected with a control plasmid. However, HTLV-I Tax-expressing PC12 cells demonstrated a marked change in the abundance and distribution of E-cadherin, which was concentrated at regions of cellular contact and accompanied by changes in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Although E-cadherin is expressed at low levels in PC12 and PC12 transfected with a control plasmid cells, the steady state level of E-cadherin in tax-expressing PC12 cells increases significantly, apparently as a result of regulation at the transcriptional level. Diminished expression of Tax protein in Tax-expressing PC12 cells exposed to antisense oligonucleotides for the Tax gene suppresses E-cadherin expression and decreases cell-cell adhesion. These findings imply that HTLV-I Tax protein enhanced E-cadherin expression modulates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion mechanisms.","['Kitajima, I', 'Kawahara, K', 'Hanyu, N', 'Shin, H', 'Tokioka, T', 'Soejima, Y', 'Tsutsui, J', 'Ozawa, M', 'Shimayama, T', 'Maruyama, I']","['Kitajima I', 'Kawahara K', 'Hanyu N', 'Shin H', 'Tokioka T', 'Soejima Y', 'Tsutsui J', 'Ozawa M', 'Shimayama T', 'Maruyama I']","['Department of Molecular and Laboratory Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cadherins/*biosynthesis', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'PC12 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1996 Mar;109 ( Pt 3):609-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is considerable variation between these studies with respect to methods of exposure assessment and reported results. Methods of exposure assessment range from simple visual criteria to costly and time consuming measurements or estimations of electric flux density. Additional individual refinements further hinder the comparability of results. We carried out several meta-analyses of data published so far taking into account the heterogeneity between studies as far as possible. Our particular interest was to investigate a potential dose-response-like relationship by comparing analyses for different cut-off points of exposure. Our meta-analyses suggest a marginal association between all cancer diagnoses combined and EMF exposure assessed by the two-level wire code (odds ratio, OR = 1.37, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.94-2.00). Based on this criterion a significant effect was found for bases of leukemia (OR = 1.66, CI: 1.11-2.49) but not for central nervous system (CNS) tumors (OR = 1.5, CI: 0.69-3.26) or lymphomas (OR = 1.32, CI: 0.52-3.37). A significant increase in overall cancer risk with increasing stages of the four-level wire code (P = 0.003) could not be confirmed when data of the initial study performed by Wertheimer and Leeper were excluded (P = 0.17). When the exposure criterion was based on distance to the transmission line, estimated ORs for all cancers combined and for leukemias increased with distances decreasing from 100 to 25 m. Those analyses incorporating data on measured or calculated EMFs demonstrated also an increase of overall cancer risk with higher cut-off points. However, regarding individual diagnoses, this finding was reflected only in the group of brain tumors. One possible explanation for the high degree of heterogeneity between studies--especially with respect to methods of exposure assessment and choice of the respective cutpoint relevant for an increase in cancer risk--could be that published cut-off points were not always chosen in advance, but were selected because in exploratory analyses the most striking results were obtained with these specific cut-off values. Should this speculation be true at least partially, any meta-analysis will yield a false-positive finding. Further results of comparable studies with strictly a priori planned analyses are necessary to properly investigate a possible link between EMF and childhood cancer.","['Meinert, R', 'Michaelis, J']","['Meinert R', 'Michaelis J']","['Institute of Medical Statistics and Documentation, University of Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Child', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Assessment']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01211237 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1996 Feb;35(1):11-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01211237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper details tenidap's cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity and the resulting pharmacological properties in experimental animals. Tenidap inhibited calcium ionophore-stimulated prostaglandin D2 synthesis by rat basophilic leukemia cells (COX-1) with an IC50 of 20 nM. In two different in vitro human test systems, tenidap inhibited COX-1 activity more potently than COX-2, although the relative potency ratio (COX-1/COX-2) differed markedly between the two systems. Tenidap inhibited the COX pathway when added to human blood in vitro (IC50, 7.8 mu M) and when administered orally to monkeys, rats and dogs (at 5, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg p.o., respectively) and COX activity measured ex vivo in blood collected 2 to 4 hours post dose. After oral administration to rats, tenidap inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema with an ED50 of 14 mg/kg and inhibited the glucocorticoid-resistant UV erythema in guinea pigs with an ED50 of 1.4 mg/kg. It retained antiinflammatory activity in adrenalectomized rats indicating that this property is independent of adrenal stimulation.

These data indicate that tenidap is an effective antiinflammatory and analgesic agent in animal models.

Analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of lymphoblastoid DNA digested with three rare-cutting enzymes, Not I, Mlu I, and Nru I, revealed the positions of 17 markers on each restriction map. The 1.8-mb YAC contig that covers this region was obtained through YAC walking mediated by sequence-tagged sites (STSs), with 29 STSs including 12 newly generated YAC end-specific STSs. The consensus restriction map from 15 overlapping YACs and the positioning of the STS markers on each clone allowed 24 markers including 4 Not I-linking STSs to be ordered and mapped physically. Comparison of the maps revealed that the proximal region contains more unmethylated CpG islands than the distal region, which suggests that many expressed genes are in the proximal region. This fine consensus physical map will be informative and useful for construction of contigs of cosmid, P1, or BAC clones for further large-scale sequencing in this gene-rich region.","['Eki, T', 'Abe, M', 'Furuya, K', 'Fujishima, N', 'Kishida, H', 'Shiratori, A', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Le Paslier, D', 'Cohen, D', 'Murakami, Y']","['Eki T', 'Abe M', 'Furuya K', 'Fujishima N', 'Kishida H', 'Shiratori A', 'Yokoyama K', 'Le Paslier D', 'Cohen D', 'Murakami Y']","['Division of Human Genome Research, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,DNA Seq,DNA sequence : the journal of DNA sequencing and mapping,9107800,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Walking', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Interferon/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10425179609010196 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Seq. 1996;6(2):95-108. doi: 10.3109/10425179609010196.,,,,"['GENBANK/D38265', 'GENBANK/D38266', 'GENBANK/D38270', 'GENBANK/D38271', 'GENBANK/D38283', 'GENBANK/D38284', 'GENBANK/D38286', 'GENBANK/D38288', 'GENBANK/D42158', 'GENBANK/D42159', 'GENBANK/D42160', 'GENBANK/D42161', 'GENBANK/D42164']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the patients not developing AML, median survival from initial EMT was 11 weeks. Nine patients received chemotherapy at the time of EMT and had a median survival of 36 weeks. The median survival for patients receiving conservative therapy for EMT was 48 weeks. Patients (n = 15) with EMT and MDS associated AML had a poor outcome regardless of therapy with a median survival of 11 weeks. Unlike other forms of isolated EMT, MDS associated EMT is not always a forerunner of AML. Premature induction therapy for MDS associated EMT does not appear to prolong survival. EMT in the setting of MDS associated AML is associated with a poor prognosis despite aggressive chemotherapy.

DIC, defined as hypofibrinogenemia in the presence of elevated fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products, was detected at presentation in 10% of 99 and during remission induction in 67% of 58 patients who were screened for DIC. Elevated levels of D-dimers (DD) were seen in all eight patients with DIC in whom they were measured. All cases of DIC were diagnosed by the ninth day of induction and were associated with infection in 15 of 39 patients. DIC did not cause any deaths but was temporally associated with two thromboses and four hemorrhages in six of the 16 patients with fibrinogen levels < 100 mg/dl but with only one hemorrhage among 23 patients (4%) with fibrinogen levels > 100 mg/dl (P < 0.01). Heparin was not administered to any patient, whereas platelets were administered to all to maintain platelet counts > 20 x 10(9)/l. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or cryoprecipitate were administered 26 patients resulting in a contemporaneous correction of the coagulopathy and in control of hemorrhages and thromboses. We conclude that DIC is rare at presentation but common during induction of adult ALL and is frequently associated with clinical complications when fibrinogen levels are < 100 mg/dl. We recommend daily testing of fibrinogen, PT, and DD during the first 10 days of induction, and for the patients with DIC platelet transfusions to maintain counts > 20 x 10(9)/l, and when fibrinogen levels fall below 100 mg/dl transfusions of FFP and/or cryoprecipitate.

The AML blast cells that produced IL-6 alone could not form autonomous in vitro colonies, whereas the blast cells that coexpressed CSF in addition to IL-6 were able to form such colonies. This suggests that IL-6 acts as a costimulator to enhance CSF-induced clonogenicity of AML blast cells. TNF-alpha and IL-1 that are produced from the blast cells may stimulate the growth of the AML blast cells by inducing production of CSF in bone marrow stromal cells or in the blast cell population itself. Improvement of clinical manifestations by the administration of an anti-IL-6 murine monoclonal antibody in a patient with AML-M5B confirmed an important role of IL-6 in in-vivo growth of the blast cells. The mRNA expression of IL-6 and its related genes in AML and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) blast cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IL-6 mRNA expression was common in AML, but rare in ALL, whereas the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) mRNA was expressed in almost all cases of AML and in more than half of the cases of ALL. In contrast, gp130 was ubiquitously expressed in both AML and ALL. A significant correlation between the levels of IL-6R expression and the responsiveness of the blast cells to exogenous IL-6 was observed. This suggests the possibility of the rapid prediction of the responsiveness of leukemic cells to exogenous IL-6 (IL-6 administration for therapy) by rapid measurement of IL-6R mRNA by RT-PCR.","['Sugiyama, H', 'Inoue, K', 'Ogawa, H', 'Yamagami, T', 'Soma, T', 'Miyake, S', 'Hirata, M', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Sugiyama H', 'Inoue K', 'Ogawa H', 'Yamagami T', 'Soma T', 'Miyake S', 'Hirata M', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Suita City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609067579 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Mar;21(1-2):49-52. doi: 10.3109/10428199609067579.,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although interferon-alpha exhibits a wide variety of cellular effects, none of these have adequately explained the mechanism of action of interferon-alpha in B-CLL. Recent attention has focussed on the role of bcl-2 in B-CLL, and the regulation of bcl-2 expression by cytokines. B-CLL is characterized by the relentless accumulation in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of a monoclonal population of long-lived B-cells. However, when these cells are cultured in vitro, they die rapidly by apoptosis or programmed cell death. It has recently been demonstrated that B-CLL cells can be protected from apoptotic death in vitro by co-culture with cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and interferon-gamma. The protection against apoptosis is correlated with increased levels of bcl-2 expression. It was suggested that interferon-alpha induced remissions in early stage B-CLL by interrupting these growth-factor dependent survival pathways and allowing the cells to die by apoptotic death in vivo. However, interferon-alpha has also been shown to protect B-CLL cells from apoptotic death in vitro. This suggests that interferon-alpha does not produce remission in B-CLL by direct effects on B-CLL cells in the circulation. Many of the cytokines which protect B-CLL cells from apoptotic cell death, are members of the cytokine receptor family which utilize a common family of signal transduction molecules. Further elucidation of these signal transduction pathways may offer the prospect of developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at inducing apoptosis of the malignant clone in vivo.","['Jewell, A P']",['Jewell AP'],"['School of Life Science, Kingston University, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609067578 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Mar;21(1-2):43-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199609067578.,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several constitutive gene defects that contribute to the development of abnormal cell behavior have been identified in the hematopoietic cells. The role of bone marrow stroma cells in leukemogenesis, however, has not been established. We studied the organization of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to see if it was impaired during the initiation and progression of these malignancies. The buffy coat, hematon, and plasma fractions were separated from BM aspirates taken from healthy donors and diseased subjects at distinct clinical stages. The structural integrity of the BM microenvironment was evaluated analyzing the morphogenetic unit, the hematon. The hematon is a multicellular complex that includes fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, resident macrophages, hematopoietic cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC), high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU), burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and terminally differentiated cells in normal BM. Hematon complexes were present in most BM aspirates from healthy donors (46H+/55). But they were absent from most of the patients with MDP (21H+/62) and AML (5H+/24) in the first perceptible phase, and from those with CML throughout the disease (5H+/55). Hematon complexes were present in the BM aspirate in 22/36 AML patients at clinical remission after chemotherapy or differentiation therapy. The hematon fraction isolated from normal BM, contained 25 times more 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and about 500-fold more 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than the BM plasma. The concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was low or undetectable in the BM plasma of some, but not all, patients with MDP (18/35) or AML (9/24). Thus, in the BM microenvironment, the metabolism of low-density lipids and lipophylic hormones are severely impaired prior to initiation or during the accelerated expansion of leukemia cells. The lack of organized stromal network and the decreased level of some lipophylic hormones, acting probably as morphogens, may contribute to the onset and progression of human myeloid leukemias.","['Blazsek, I', 'Farabos, C', 'Quittet, P', 'Labat, M L', 'Bringuier, A F', 'Triana, B K', 'Machover, D', 'Reynes, M', 'Misset, J L']","['Blazsek I', 'Farabos C', 'Quittet P', 'Labat ML', 'Bringuier AF', 'Triana BK', 'Machover D', 'Reynes M', 'Misset JL']","['Institute of Cancer and Immunogenetics, Claude Bernard Association and Blood Disease and Tumor Clinic, Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcitriol/blood/*deficiency/pharmacokinetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1996;20(1):31-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using CAT reporter constructs containing a heterologous general enhancer, we demonstrate that the CD80 promoter is active in CD80-expressing Raji cells, but has no significant activity in Jurkat cells that are CD80 negative. Transcriptional activity in Raji increases as the promoter is truncated from nucleotide position -906 to -84. However, truncation of this promoter to -41 significantly decreases its activity. Within this region is one stretch of DNA that is protected in DNase I footprint analysis and that shows some sequence similarity to the NF-kappaB element. Site-specific mutation of the 5' purine-rich portion of this element (B7-RE, or B7 regulatory element) abrogates expression. Nuclear extracts prepared from Raji, or from leukemic cells induced to express CD80, form a distinct complex(es) with B7-RE in electromobility shift assays. Moreover, a consensus NF-kappaB oligonucleotide can compete with B7-RE for nuclear extract binding. However, no super-shifted bands are observed when extracts are preincubated with Abs to p50, p65, or other Rel proteins. Moreover, we find that recombinant p49 (RelB), p50, p65 (RelA), or p49/p65 heterodimers do not bind B7-RE in vitro.

In the present study, we examined the effect of capsaicin and its analogue, resiniferatoxin, on the activation of NF-kappa B induced by different agents including TNF. The pretreatment of human myeloid ML-1a cells with capsaicin blocked TNF-mediated activation of NF-kappa B in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Resiniferatoxin was at least eight times as potent as capsaicin in inhibiting NF-kappa B activation. Neither agent by itself activated NF-kappa B or affected the DNA-binding ability of NF-kappa B. Capsaicin also blocked phorbol ester-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but that mediated through okadaic acid was less effective, suggesting there is a difference in the mechanism of activation of NF-kappa B by different agents. Capsaicin treatment of cells also blocked the degradation of I kappa B alpha, and thus the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, which is essential for NF-kappa B activation. TNF-dependent promoter activity of I kappa B alpha, which contains NF-kappa B binding sites, was also inhibited by capsaicin.

Consequently, Mov-13 embryos do not transcribe alpha 1 (I) collagen mRNA and lack type I collagen protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Homozygotes die within 12-14 days of embryonic development, in part from the rupture of large blood vessels, and also exhibit deficiencies in hematopoesis and assembly of the ECM (Lohler et al. [1984] Cell 38:597-607). Several matricellular proteins, proteoglycans, and growth factors bind to type I collagen, e.g., fibronectin, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), decorin, and transforming growth factor-beta. Here we investigate the expression and function of SPARC in the absence of type I collagen. We show that fibroblasts isolated from Mov-13 homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type embryos transcribed and translated SPARC mRNA in vitro. However, accumulation of extracellular SPARC was severely affected in the tissues of Mov-13 homozygotes, whereas extracellular deposition of the secreted glycoproteins fibronectin and type III collagen was not altered. Since SPARC has been shown to be a regulator of cell shape, the functional consequences of the absence of extracellular SPARC were evaluated in collagen gel contraction assays. Fibroblasts isolated from homozygous Mov-13 mice did not contract native type I collagen gels as efficiently as fibroblasts from heterozygous littermates; however, addition of exogenous SPARC enhanced the contraction of collagen by homozygous Mov-13 fibroblasts. The stimulatory effect of SPARC was blocked by antibodies specific for the amino terminus of the protein. These results provide evidence that type I collagen is one of the major extracellular proteins that binds SPARC in vivo. Furthermore, the capacity of fibroblasts to contract ECM in vitro is enhanced by extracellular SPARC. We therefore propose that the remodeling of ECM by cells in vivo is regulated in part by a specific interaction between SPARC and type I collagen.","['Iruela-Arispe, M L', 'Vernon, R B', 'Wu, H', 'Jaenisch, R', 'Sage, E H']","['Iruela-Arispe ML', 'Vernon RB', 'Wu H', 'Jaenisch R', 'Sage EH']","['Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Col1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osteonectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/22 10:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/22 10:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199610)207:2<171::AID-AJA5>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199610)207:2<171::AID-AJA5>3.0.CO;2-E [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Dyn. 1996 Oct;207(2):171-83. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199610)207:2<171::AID-AJA5>3.0.CO;2-E.,,,"['GM40711/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD25059/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL03174/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polarization measurements of intracellular exogenous fluorescein have been shown to reflect the physiological state of the cells. The relationship between intracellular fluorescein fluorescence polarization (IFFP) and cell cycle, was investigated in the leukemia T-lymphocyte Jurkat cell line. Jurkat T cells were cultured in increasing cell densities, their cell cycle progression cytometrically monitored and the IFFP measured. At the highest cell density, the subpopulation of cells at the resting phases the (Gzero/G1) predominated, and the mean IFFP was 0.186 +/- 0.015. At the lowest density, with diminished proportion of cells in the G1/G2 stages the mean IFFP decreased to 0.126 +/- 0.01. Treatment of the Jurkat T cell line with phase arrested agents 1 microM hydroxyurea, or 1 microM nocodazole, arrests the cells in the S and G2/M phases, respectively. These treated cells exhibit significantly lower IFFP values, mean polarization value 0.140, as compared to 0.171 +/- 0.009 in control cells. Preincubation of Jurkat cells in buffer in accumulation of the cells in the Gzero/G1 phases as well as a parallel increase in IFFP. A characteristic decrease in IFFP was demonstrated upon triggering these cells with Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). High correlation (Pearson correlation = 0.942) was found between percentage of cells in the Gzero/G1 phases and the mean IFFP of the measured cell population. These results may indicate that the intracellular microviscosity of Jurkat T cells as measured by IFFP, is changing over the cell cycle.","['Zurgil, N', 'Deutsch, M', 'Tirosh, R', 'Brodie, C']","['Zurgil N', 'Deutsch M', 'Tirosh R', 'Brodie C']","['Schottenstein Cellscan Center for Early Detection of Cancer, Physics Dept., Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL39R93PRE (diacetylfluorescein)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Fluoresceins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1247/csf.21.271 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 1996 Aug;21(4):271-6. doi: 10.1247/csf.21.271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this further, surface antigens on blood eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia (23 bronchial asthma, 6 eosinophilic pneumonia, 1 Kimura's disease and 1 adult T-cell leukemia) and from 8 control subjects were examined using a new direct method for fluorescence detection of eosinophils. HLA-DR+ and CD4+ eosinophil counts were higher in patients with bronchial asthma and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) than in patients from other groups and in control subjects. CD11b+ eosinophil counts in Kimura's disease and ATL were smaller than those in the other groups.

CD44+ eosinophil counts in eosinophilic pneumonia were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with the other groups and control subjects. These results suggest the existence of functional heterogeneity in the different eosinophilic diseases, with eosinophils in bronchial asthma and eosinophilic pneumonia being more highly activated in migration, activation and immunoregulation. On the other hand, eosinophils in Kimura's disease and ATL might be functionally down-regulated.

IL-5 shows activity on the murine chronic B cell leukemia cell line BCL1-B20, inducing differentiation into IgM-secreting cells, but IL-3 and GM-CSF do not have such activity. To elucidate whether the lineage specificity of IL-5 is due to restricted expression of the IL-5 receptor alpha chain (IL-5R alpha), transfectants of BCL1-B20 were established that express IL-3 receptor alpha (BCL1-3R) or GM-CSF receptor alpha (BCL1-GMR). BCL1-3R and BCL1-GMR acquired responsiveness to IL-3 and GM-CSF, respectively, to an extent similar to IL-5 stimulation, resulting in IgM-secreting cells. Thus, the differentiation of BCL1-B20 into IgM-secreting cells can be equally supported by either IL-3 or GM-CSF, suggesting that intracellular signaling through IL-5R can be replaced by signaling from IL-3R and GM-CSFR. These results support the notion that the lineage specificity of IL-5 is mainly due to the restricted expression of IL-5R alpha. Regulation of IL-5R alpha, IL-3R alpha and GM-CSFR alpha expression in the developmental stage appears to be important for understanding the unique function of these cytokines on a particular cell type.","['Shiiba, M', 'Takaki, S', 'Takatsu, K']","['Shiiba M', 'Takaki S', 'Takatsu K']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000237406 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1996;111 Suppl 1:12-5. doi: 10.1159/000237406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very few data are available on depletion caused by the Erwinia chrysanthemi (E. chrysanthemi) product. Since it has been suggested that L-ASN depletion may have been overestimated in the past due to residual L-ASE activity, samples in this study have been analyzed after deproteinization with sulphosalicylic acid. Patients undergoing subsequent exposures to L-ASE derived from E. chrysanthemi have been investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at our institution entered this study. L-ASE was given at conventional doses (10,000 IU/sqm) every three days during the induction phase (8 doses, first exposure) or twice a week (4 doses, second exposure) during the reinduction phase. High-dose L-ASE (i.e., HD-L-ASE 25,000 IU/sqm) was given weekly, for a total of 20 doses, as a second or third exposure during the reinduction and/or maintenance phases. To determine the plasma levels of L-ASN, samples were deproteinized with sulphosalicylic acid, stored at -80 degrees C and then analyzed by HPLC after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. The CSF samples were analyzed by the same procedure. An experiment was carried out to detect in vitro L-ASE deactivation in patients' plasma. RESULTS: L-ASN plasma depletion was observed in 80% of the cases during the first exposure to conventional doses of L-ASE and only in 25% of the cases during the second or third exposures to either conventional or high doses of L-ASE. A correlation was found between plasma and CSF L-ASN levels. Activity inhibitory to L-ASE was found in the plasma of patients not depleted during L-ASE treatment and was not found in the plasma of those in whom L-ASN plasma depletion was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: L-ASN plasma depletion is regularly obtained in the majority of patients during the first exposure to conventional doses of E. chrysanthemi L-ASE. Conversely, in most cases depletion does not occur during subsequent exposures.

A GATMO experience. Argintine Group of Bone Marrow Transplant.,719-24,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a multivariate analysis the prognostic factors associated with hematopoietic recovery and the supportive care requirements after autotransplant of progenitor cells (PC) from various sources: bone marrow (BMPC), BMPC & peripheral blood (PBPC), and PBPC alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 570 patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors underwent high-dose therapy followed by autotransplant. PBPC were obtained after mobilization with chemotherapy and/or cytokines. One-hundred five patients received BMPC, 217 received BMPC & PBPC and 248 PBPC alone; all of the patients received G-CSF or GM-CSF after infusion. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis the recovery of neutrophils was adversely associated with low numbers of nucleated cells infused (P < 0.13), bone marrow progenitor cell source, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma and acute leukemia (P < 0.001). The factors that adversely affected platelet recovery were low number of nucleated cells and diagnosis of multiple myeloma and acute leukemia (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BMPC adversely affect neutrophil recovery while low numbers of nucleated cells and diagnosis of multiple myeloma and acute leukemia adversely affect both neutrophil and platelet recovery.","['Pavlovsky, S', 'Koziner, B', 'Milone, G', 'Lastiri, F', 'Bayo, R', 'Fernandez, I', 'Dengra, C', 'Martinez Rolon, J', 'Feldman, L', 'Kusminsky, G', 'Corrado, C', 'Bullorsky, E', 'Milone, J', 'Garcia, J J', 'Cerutti, I', 'Saporito, G', 'Robinson, A', 'Canepa, C']","['Pavlovsky S', 'Koziner B', 'Milone G', 'Lastiri F', 'Bayo R', 'Fernandez I', 'Dengra C', 'Martinez Rolon J', 'Feldman L', 'Kusminsky G', 'Corrado C', 'Bullorsky E', 'Milone J', 'Garcia JJ', 'Cerutti I', 'Saporito G', 'Robinson A', 'Canepa C']","['GATMO-Grupo Argentino de Trasplante de Medula Osea, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010721 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)65586-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Sep;7(7):719-24. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010721.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By flow cytometry, it could be shown that among several surface adhesion molecules (ICAM-1/CD54, VLA-4/CD49d, Mac-1/CD11b, LFA-1/CD11a, LFA-2/CD2, LFA-3/CD58, VCAM-1), only the constitutively expressed immunoglobulin family member intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is modulated by proinflammatory cytokines on HMC-1 mast cells. Stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) resulted, in addition to interleukin-(IL-)4, in selective upregulation of ICAM-1 expression. Costimulation of either IL-4 or IFN-gamma with TNF-alpha further increased the ICAM-1 expression as compared to the stimuli alone. In contrast, stem-cell factor (SCF), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-10, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF), and the complement split product C5a failed to modulate the expression of any adhesion molecule examined. The levels of cytoplasmic free calcium in HMC-1 mast cells were not altered by cross-linking surface ICAM-1, suggesting linkage of other intracellular signaling pathways. This cytokine-induced upregulation of ICAM-1 expression might reveal a putative regulatory mechanism of mast-cell interaction with effector cells bearing the counterparts of ICAM-1 (CD54), the molecules Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and leukosialin (CD43), and the principal ligand LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18).","['Wedi, B', 'Elsner, J', 'Czech, W', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Kapp, A']","['Wedi B', 'Elsner J', 'Czech W', 'Butterfield JH', 'Kapp A']","['Department of Dermatology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*immunology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Allergy. 1996 Oct;51(10):676-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dietary regimens studied included restriction of specific dietary components (energy, fat, protein and mineral), as well as different sources of dietary protein (casein, soy protein and lactalbumin). A statistical approach based on contributing causes of death was used to obtain the mortality due to all neoplasms, and the relative onset rate of frequently observed neoplasms, e.g., leukemia, pituitary adenoma, testicular interstitial cell tumor, etc. Only the regimen involving energy restriction reduced the mortality due to all neoplasms. Neither reduction of individual components without energy restriction, nor replacement of casein with soy protein or lactalbumin as the protein source affected mortality. Analyses of the relative onset rate of selected neoplasms also indicated that only a reduction of energy intake suppressed the occurrence of most of these neoplasms. Other dietary regimens, at most, suppressed a few types of neoplasm.

We sought to discover whether amplification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occurred in leukaemia, and found it was often remarkably amplified in the blast cells of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We used gene dosage experiments to quantify the amount of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA. DNA extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or bone marrow of healthy individuals or patients was simultaneously hybridized with a probe for the mitochondrial genome and a control probe for the renin gene on human chromosome 1. Comparative densitometric ratios of approximately 1 were obtained between the two signals in 20 normal control peripheral blood samples. In contrast, comparative ratios in the range of 2-50 were observed in 25 AML samples and 13 of these showed 8-fold or greater amplification of mtDNA relative to normal peripheral blood controls. An additional four cases of AML were investigated at both presentation and remission and showed 3-10-fold amplification of mtDNA at presentation, but no amplification when in clinical remission. 18 cases of chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) were also studied in chronic phase and showed mtDNA dosage levels equivalent to normal peripheral blood controls. However, 8/9 CGL patients showed mtDNA amplification during transformation from chronic phase.

In contrast to ARA-C, paclitaxel dose responses were independent of cell culture method, the growth factors G-CSF and GM-CSF, and the ligands all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and hydrocortisone. Most blast cell populations were sensitive to paclitaxel; compared with normal marrow progenitors the dose responses were markedly heterogenous with some more, and others less, sensitive. Remission marrow progenitor paclitaxel responses resembled those of AML blasts in heterogeneity. The cell culture model tested the effect of pacliataxel and ATRA on the ARA-C dose responses of OCI/ AML-5; paclitaxel exposure was either before or after ARA-C to test for an effect of schedule; ATRA was added to the MEC cultures after paclitaxel and ARA-C. Repeat experiments were done to test three dose levels each of paclitaxel and ATRA. When paclitaxel was given after ARA-C, synergism was found for all but one of the dose combinations tested; only three examples of synergy were seen when paclitaxel preceded ARA-C.

It is not clear whether myeloablative therapy used in conjunction with autologous transplantation contributes to the development of MDS/AML or whether the conventional chemotherapy preceding the transplant, and administered over a prolonged period, causes these secondary malignancies. To address this issue, we examined 188 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who had received AT. 71 patients with no more than one cycle of standard chemotherapy were enrolled in our Total Therapy program, designed to avoid exposure to alkylating agents prior to peripheral blood stem cell mobilization (group 1). The median duration of pretransplant therapy in group 1 was 7.6 months and significantly shorter than the 24 months of 117 patients (group 2) with more prolonged conventional therapy (P = 0.0001). All seven patients developing MDS post-transplantation belonged to group 2 (P = 0.02); the median durations from initial therapy and first transplant were 66 months (range 38-86) and 24 months (range 9-39), respectively. Our findings provide evidence that prolonged standard-dose alkylating agent therapy prior to transplantation, rather than autotransplant-supported myeloablative treatment, is associated with development of MDS/AML. Stem cell damaging alkylator treatment should be avoided, not to compromise PBSC collection, but also to reduce the risk of treatment-related MDS/AML.","['Govindarajan, R', 'Jagannath, S', 'Flick, J T', 'Vesole, D H', 'Sawyer, J', 'Barlogie, B', 'Tricot, G']","['Govindarajan R', 'Jagannath S', 'Flick JT', 'Vesole DH', 'Sawyer J', 'Barlogie B', 'Tricot G']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1891.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Nov;95(2):349-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1891.x.,,,"['CA55819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spin trap 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulphonate (DBNBS), which is oxidized in the presence of H2O2 and peroxidase enzymes, was used to produce a characteristic three-line spectrum, and it was found that an identical spectrum was produced by human lymphoblastic leukaemic cells (CCRF-CEM cells) after exposure to adriamycin. We tested our hypothesis further by exposing CCRF-CEM cells to subtoxic concentrations of adriamycin (10(-8), 10(-9) and 10(-10) M) and low concentrations of H2O2 (10(-8), 10(-9) and 10(-10) M) and subsequently monitored cell proliferation. We found that low concentrations of both adriamycin and H2O2 significantly stimulate CCRF-CEM cell proliferation. We therefore conclude that subtoxic concentrations of adriamycin are likely to induce cell proliferation via an H2O2 mediated mechanism.","['Yang, M', 'Nazhat, N B', 'Jiang, X', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Blake, D R', 'Newland, A C', 'Morris, C J']","['Yang M', 'Nazhat NB', 'Jiang X', 'Kelsey SM', 'Blake DR', 'Newland AC', 'Morris CJ']","[""Inflammation Research Group, St Bartholomew's School of Medicine and Dentistry, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1901.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Nov;95(2):339-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1901.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TH-69 is a high-affinity antibody (7.6 x 10(9) M-1) that rapidly induced modulation during treatment. The Fc-portion of the antibody was required for effective tumour cell killing. Complement deposition was found on tumour sections after TH-69 treatment and in part may account for tumour destruction. There was no evidence for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The kinetics of tumour disappearance suggested the initiation of a programmed cell death (PCD), despite the lack of significant DNA fragmentation.

Recently we found that many different mature B-cell malignancies proliferate upon stimulation via the CD40 antigen, and this led us to investigate whether a similar CD40 activation on ALL cells could also induce proliferation. First, we measured CD40 expression in 21 ALL cases; all were CD40+, although mostly weak. Next, we triggered the CD40 antigen by anti-CD40 antibodies and by a CD40 ligand-expressing cell line. In addition, we measured the influence of IL-3, IL-4 and IL-7 with and without these stimuli. In 8/10 cases proliferation, measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation, could be induced after CD40 crosslinking, especially in the presence of IL-3. Stimulation via the CD40 ligand was more successful than using crosslinked anti-CD40 antibodies. IL-4 inhibited the spontaneous proliferation found in three cases, but stimulated proliferation after CD40 crosslinking. IL-7 did not contribute to proliferation. Morphology, immunophenotyping and surface marker analysis, combined with DNA flow cytometry confirmed that the proliferation found could be ascribed to the ALL cells. In conclusion, B-lineage ALL cases are CD40+, and many can be cultured using CD40 stimulation and IL-3.","['Planken, E V', 'Dijkstra, N H', 'Bakkus, M', 'Willemze, R', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C']","['Planken EV', 'Dijkstra NH', 'Bakkus M', 'Willemze R', 'Kluin-Nelemans JC']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/physiology', 'Preleukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1908.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Nov;95(2):319-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1908.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate this hypothesis we used a delta assay for primitive haemopoietic cells (P delta assay for P delta cells) which allows investigation of the kinetics of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (CFU-GM) production. The frequencies of these primitive (P delta) cells were similar in CML blood (14.5/10(5) mononuclear cells), CML marrow (17.3/10(5)) and normal marrow (11.6/10(5)) The average frequency in normal blood is only 0.58/10(6). The absolute numbers of P delta cells in CML patients are therefore greatly increased. The average numbers of CFU-GM produced by individual P delta cells were reduced in CML blood (8.1) and marrow (11.6) compared with normal marrow (28.5). This is consistent with a reduced probability of differentiation at the single cell level in CML. Although the absolute number of CFU-GM produced by individual CML P delta cells was subnormal there was a relative increase in the number of day 7 CFU-GM compared with the number of day 14 and 21 CFU-GM, which agrees with the 'discordant maturation hypothesis'. This bias towards day 7 colony formation could reflect accelerated maturation by the CFU-GM produced by P delta cells or, alternatively, the production of CFU-GM with shorter than normal maturation pathways. Overall, these results suggest that discordant maturation does not by itself account for myeloid expansion in CML. It is more likely that myeloid expansion in CML is due mainly to an increase in the number of primitive haemopoietic progenitor cells.","['Marley, S B', 'Lewis, J L', 'Scott, M A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Lewis JL', 'Scott MA', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1910.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Nov;95(2):299-305. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1910.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer of p16ink4a gene in several solid tumour cell lines with functional pRb and lacking both p16ink4a alleles has resulted in a dramatic reduction of cell proliferation, and the aim of this work was to confirm this effect in leukaemic (especially ALL) cell lines. We tested the proliferation in liquid medium and in soft agar after transfer of p16ink4a gene by a retroviral vector in leukaemic cell lines with homozygous p16ink4a gene deletion (K562, CEM, Jurkat cell lines) or with p16ink4a gene hemizygous deletion and a point mutation inactivating the remaining allele (HL60 cell line). The viral titre obtained after transfection of PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line, which has a p16ink4a gene homozygous deletion, was low, suggesting that p16ink4a gene expression could impair viral production of retroviral packaging cell lines derived from the NIH3T3 cell line. After retroviral transfer of p16ink4a in cell lines and G418 selection in liquid medium, a strong cell proliferation inhibition was observed for K562, CEM and Jurkat, but no inhibition was seen for HL60. A strong growth reduction in soft agar was also observed with p16ink4a-transduced CEM, Jurkat and K562 cells, with a moderate growth reduction in the HL60 cell line. The growth inhibition in liquid culture, of K562 and Jurkat cell lines, was confirmed by electroporation transfer of the p16ink4a gene. Our findings show that p16ink4a gene transfer has a growth-inhibitory effect in leukaemic cell lines with p16ink4a gene homozygous deletion.

The latter led to a minimum of one log increase in sensitivity of detection in 62% of alleles from 19 samples (16/28 in FR1; 11/15 in FR2) tested in parallel on log DNA dilutions, and to at least a 10(-2) level of sensitivity of detection in 15/19. The improved resolution allowed an approximate 20% increase in the number of clonal alleles detected, and consequently doubled the incidence of oligoclonality (6/26; 23%).

DESIGN: Prospective cohort and retrospective case-control series. SETTING: University hospital pediatric referral center. PATIENTS: Fifty-six consecutive immunocompromised children (ie, the prospective group) with laboratory evidence consistent with acute or recently acquired CMV infection, which was defined as CMV cultured from the blood, urine, nasopharynx, or biopsy specimen, recent seroconversion, a 4-fold increase in the CMV antibody titer, or an antibody titer of 1:512 or greater. Ninety-three immunocompromised children (ie, the retrospective group) with acute CMV or previous CMV exposure, which was defined as a CMV titer of 1:4 or greater and less than 1:512.

Since the P2T receptor seems to be specific to platelets, we investigated the possibility that the human megakaryoblastic cell line Meg-01 might express the platelet ADP receptor, using functional studies and the ADP analogue [33P]2MeSADP as a specific P2T radioligand. ADP and 2MeSADP were able to induce shape change and pseudopod formation in Meg-01 cells. [33P]2MeSADP binding to membrane preparations was saturable and specific, binding sites being of high affinity (Kd = 13 +/- 3 nM) and present at a concentration of 13 +/- 7 fmoles/mu g protein. In contrast to UTP and GTP, ADP and ATP were able to displace the specific [33P]2MeSADP binding. ADP, 2MeSADP, UTP and ATP induced a dose dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Desensitization experiments demonstrated that UTP, and ADP share a common P2U purinoceptor and that Meg-01 cells also express a P2T purinoceptor for which ADP and 2MeSADP are agonists and ATP a competitive antagonist. It was concluded that the human megakaryoblastic cell line Meg-01 expresses two distinct types of functional P2 receptor; a P2U and a P2T purinoceptor. This cell line could therefore provide the necessary material to clone the as yet unidentified platelet P2T purinoceptor.","['Hechler, B', 'Cazenave, J P', 'Hanau, D', 'Gachet, C']","['Hechler B', 'Cazenave JP', 'Hanau D', 'Gachet C']","['INSERM Unite 311, Biologie et Pharmacologie des Interactions du Sang avec les Vaisseaux et les Biomateriaux, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Platelet Activation', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Purinergic/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1995;37(4):231-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parental MEL cells did not express GABA-gated chloride channels but recombinant cells were sensitive to pressure-applied GABA. The GABA responses reversed at the equilibrium potential predicted for chloride ions. These results show that the alpha1 subunit of the bovine GABAA receptor inserts in the plasma membrane of the MEL cells and forms homo-oligomeric chloride channels that are gated by GABA.

The sonodynamic effect was found for a number of structurally unrelated compounds, and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Recently, Jeffers et al. (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 97:669-676; 1995) have shown that the sonodynamic action of nontoxic concentrations of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl formamide (MMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) combined with ultrasound, on killing of cultured HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, and attributed this toxic effect to unknown short lived reactive species produced from these solutes by ultrasonic cavitation. Using the spin trap 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate (DBNBS) in nitrogen-saturated aqueous solutions of DMF, MMF, or DMSO exposed to 50 kHz ultrasound, we detected formation of .CH3 and .CH2N(CH3)CHO radical adducts for DMF, mostly .CH2NHCHO adducts for MMF, and .CH3 adducts for DMSO. These radicals were formed either by reactions of the solutes with ultrasound-generated .H and .OH radicals (such as .CH2R-type radicals in DMF and MMF, and .CH3 radicals in DMSO), or by direct pyrolysis of the weak bonds in the solute molecules (e.g., .CH3 radicals from DMF). In air-saturated sonicated solutions these carbon centered radicals were converted to the corresponding peroxyl radicals and spin trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO); .OOCH2N(CH3)CHO radicals were identified in DMF, .OOCH2NHCHO radicals in MMF, and .OOCH3 radicals in DMSO solutions. We suggest that these radical species by virtue of their longer lifetimes and higher selectivity, compared to .OH radicals, which are also formed in sonicated solutions, are the species responsible for sonodynamic cell killing by the combined effect of ultrasound with DMF, MMF, or DMSO.","['Misik, V', 'Riesz, P']","['Misik V', 'Riesz P']","['Radiation Biology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Formamides)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '3170-83-0 (perhydroxyl radical)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '83016-63-1 (3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonate)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Benzenesulfonates/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/metabolism', 'Dimethylformamide/metabolism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Formamides/metabolism', 'Free Radicals/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Nitroso Compounds/metabolism', 'Peroxides/*metabolism', 'Spin Labels', '*Ultrasonics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891584995020098 [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(95)02009-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1996;20(1):129-38. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(95)02009-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha was time-dependent, requiring at least 6 hr of exposure. Both actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibited the TNF-alpha mediated increase in L-arginine transport, indicating that de novo RNA and protein synthesis were required. Ribonuclease protection analysis revealed the presence of cationic amino acid transporter (CAT)-1 and CAT-2 mRNA. Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with TNF-alpha selectively increased the levels of CAT-2 mRNA, whereas message for CAT-1 remained unchanged. These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha stimulates L-arginine transport in endothelial cells by selectively inducing the expression of CAT-2 mRNA. The capacity of TNF-alpha to stimulate the expression of CAT-2 protein may provide an important mechanism by which increases in substrate are provided to endothelial cells during periods of elevated L-arginine metabolism.","['Durante, W', 'Liao, L', 'Cheng, K', 'Schafer, A I']","['Durante W', 'Liao L', 'Cheng K', 'Schafer AI']","['Houston VA Medical Center, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Assoc Am Physicians,Proceedings of the Association of American Physicians,9514310,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Proc Assoc Am Physicians. 1996 Sep;108(5):356-61.,,,['HL36045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its differential diagnosis, however, includes a variety of other hematopoietic and particularly B-cell lymphoid neoplasms that are best identified in paraffin sections using immunostains. To determine the paraffin-section immunoreactivity of MCD, 20 specimens from 14 patients with MCD and 1 bone marrow sample (from a patient with probable MCD) that showed equivocal metachromasia, were stained with antitryptase, CD68 (KP-1), CD20 (L26), antilysozyme, and antimyeloperoxidase antibodies. Ten hairy cell leukemias (HCLs), six lymphomas of parafollicular and/or monocytoid B-cell (MBCLs) and low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) types, six granulocytic sarcomas, and five acute myeloid leukemias with monocytic differentiation (M4 and M5 types) were also stained. Tryptase positivity was identified in all of the MCD cases. The staining was moderate to strong in 20 of the 21 specimens, including the probable MCD case. No other neoplasms tested were tryptase positive. CD68 showed similar to even stronger staining in all of the specimens of MCD, HCL, granulocytic sarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (M4 and M5 types) tested and in five of the six MBCL and/or MALT-type lymphomas. Weak-to-moderate lysozyme staining seemed to be present in at least 7 of the MCD specimens, whereas there was a lack of staining for myeloperoxidase in 12 specimens, and 7 specimens were nonevaluable (1 case was not tested). Myeloperoxidase was identified in all of the granulocytic sarcomas and acute myeloid leukemias (M4 and M5 types) but not in any HCLs, MBCLs, or low-grade lymphomas of MALT type. CD20 was negative in all of the MCD and myelomonocytic neoplasms but positive in all of the HCLs, MBCLs, and low-grade B-cell lymphomas of MALT type. MCD, therefore, has a characteristic tryptase-positive, CD68-positive, and CD20-negative phenotype in paraffin sections. This distinguishes MCD from the hematopoietic and/or lymphoid disorders that it most closely resembles.","['Li, W V', 'Kapadia, S B', 'Sonmez-Alpan, E', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Li WV', 'Kapadia SB', 'Sonmez-Alpan E', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD20/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Chymases', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry', 'Mastocytosis/*pathology', 'Microtomy', 'Muramidase/*analysis', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Peroxidase/*analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis', 'Skin/chemistry/pathology', 'Tryptases']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1996 Oct;9(10):982-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DRCs in 13 of 13 specimens with reactive follicular hyperplasia were uniformly immunoreactive with the NGFR-specific antibody NGFR5 and with the DRC-specific antibody DRC-1. We also found that the DRCs associated with 30 of 30 cases of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were immunoreactive with NGFR5 in a pattern similar to that seen with DRC-1, in contrast to a previous study. Our results were similar in frozen tissue and microwave-treated paraffin sections. Four of four cases of diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, six of six cases of immunoblastic large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and three of three cases of small noncleaved cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma did not exhibit significant tumor-associated NGFR5-positive DRCs. Similarly, no NGFR5 staining was observed in eight of eight cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia or in six of six cases of marginal zone lymphoma, except in residual germinal centers. However, in 10 of 11 cases of mantle cell lymphoma, the DRCs present in a loose tumor-associated meshwork were reactive with NGFR5; this finding is of potential utility in the differential diagnosis of low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. In four of four cases of nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease, tumor nodule-associated DRCs were immunoreactive for NGFR in a pattern similar to that seen with DRC-1, but NGFR-positive DRCs were not observed in association with other types of Hodgkin's disease. These results indicate that NGFR expression by DRCs is not lost in follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and mantle cell lymphomas. Nerve growth factor and NGFR may have a role in the function of DRCs and the formation of the DRC matrix in normal and neoplastic lymphoid follicles and in other DRC-associated neoplasms.","['Dorfman, D M', 'Shahsafaei, A']","['Dorfman DM', 'Shahsafaei A']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tissue Fixation/methods']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1996 Oct;9(10):959-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimation procedure entailed identifying work areas within each manufacturing process, historical changes in exposure potential and specific tasks involving exposure, and using mathematical models to calculate job- and time-period-specific average exposures. The resulting estimates were linked with the subjects' work histories to obtain cumulative exposure estimates, which were employed in stratified and Poisson regression analyses of mortality rates. Mantel-Haenszel rate ratios adjusted by race, age, and cumulative styrene exposure increase with cumulative butadiene exposure from 1 in the nonexposed category to 4.5 in the category of 80 ppm-years or more (P = 0.01).

A trend of increasing risk with butadiene exposure is still present after exclusion of the nonexposed category (P = 0.03).

Earlier reports on this cohort found a statistically significant deficit for all causes of death and lower than expected mortality for most leading causes of death. Prior reports noted an excess of deaths from lymphosarcoma primarily in those employed less than 10 years, first employed before 1946, and employed in jobs with the potential for daily exposure to butadiene (BD). There was a nonsignificant elevation for leukemia in persons potentially exposed to BD on an intermittent basis. The purpose of this update was to examine the patterns of mortality with four additional years of follow-up. Persons who had become eligible since the cohort was last updated through 1990 were also added. A total of 1222 deaths were identified, and death certificates were obtained for all but 20 of the deaths (1.6%). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death is 88 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 83-93), and for all cancer, the SMR is 92 (95% CI = 82-104). There were 42 deaths from lymphohematopoietic cancers (LHC) with 28.6 expected (SMR = 147, 95% CI = 106-198), 9 observed vs. 4.7 expected deaths for lymphosarcoma (SMR = 191, 95% CI = 87-364), 13 observed vs. 11.5 expected deaths for leukemia (SMR = 113, 95% CI = 60-193), and 15 observed vs. 9.9 expected deaths from cancer of other lymphatic tissue (SMR = 152, 95% CI = 85-250). Subcohort analyses showed that the elevated risk of all LHC and its subcategories was restricted to persons who were first employed before 1950. As an adjunct to the SMR analyses, modeling was done using a qualitative cumulative exposure score as a time-dependent explanatory variable for, (1) all LHC (ICD 200-209); (2) lymphosarcoma (ICD 200); (3) lymphosarcoma and other lymphoma (ICD 200, 202); (4) multiple myeloma (ICD 203); and (5) leukemia (ICD 204-207). The cumulative exposure score was not significantly associated with any of these cancers. Cancer risk was found to increase with age for all of the LHC groups analyzed, except for lymphosarcoma. Similarly, cancer risk was found to increase with age-at-hire for all of the LHC groups except for multiple myeloma.","['Divine, B J', 'Hartman, C M']","['Divine BJ', 'Hartman CM']","['Texaco Inc., Houston, TX 77251, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects']",1996/10/28 00:00,1996/10/28 00:01,['1996/10/28 00:00'],"['1996/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(96)03442-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(96)03442-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1996 Oct 28;113(1-3):169-81. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(96)03442-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF impairs proliferation of AtT20 cells (25% reduction versus control, P < 0.03), while simultaneously enhancing ACTH secretion (2-fold, P < 0.001) and augmenting ACTH responsiveness to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) action (4-fold, P < 0.001). This attenuation of cell growth is due to a block of cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase, as measured by flow cytometric analysis (24 +/- 0.8 versus 11.57 +/- 1.5, P < 0.001). Using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, loss of cells in S phase was confirmed (25 +/- 0.08 to 9.4 +/- 1.4, P < 0.008). In contrast, CRH induced the G2/M phase (3.6 +/- 0.2 to 15.4 +/- 3, P < 0.001). This effect was blunted by LIF (P < 0.001 versus CRH alone). Cyclin A mRNA levels, which decline in S phase, were stimulated 3.5-fold by LIF and markedly suppressed by CRH. These results indicate a LIF-induced cell cycle block occurring at G1/S in corticotroph cells. Thus, LIF reduces proliferation, enhances ACTH secretion, and potentiates effects of CRH on ACTH secretion while blocking effects of CRH on the cell cycle. Responses of these three markers of differentiated corticotroph function indicate LIF to be a differentiation factor for pituitary corticotroph cells by preferential phenotypic switching from proliferative to synthetic.","['Stefana, B', 'Ray, D W', 'Melmed, S']","['Stefana B', 'Ray DW', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1996/10/29 00:00,1996/10/29 00:01,['1996/10/29 00:00'],"['1996/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.22.12502 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 29;93(22):12502-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.22.12502.,PMC38021,,"['DK 42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The algorithm used a multiplicative model to adjust recently measured quantitative exposure data to past scenarios for which representative exposure measurement data did not exist. This was accomplished through the development of exposure modifiers to account for differences in the workplace, the materials handled, the environmental conditions, and the tasks performed. Values for exposure modifiers were obtained empirically and through physical/chemical relationships. Dates for changes that altered exposure potential were obtained from archive records, retired employee interviews, and from current operations personnel. Exposure modifiers were used multiplicatively, adjusting available measured data to represent the relevant exposure scenario and time period. Changes in exposure modifiers translated to step changes in exposure estimates. Though limited by availability of data, a validation exercise suggested that the algorithm provided accurate exposure estimates for benzene (compared with measured data in industrial hygiene survey reports); the estimates generally differed by an average of less than 20% from the measured values. This approach is proposed to quantify exposures retrospectively where there are sufficient data to develop reliable current era estimates and where a historical accounting of key exposure modifiers can be developed, but where there are insufficient historic exposure measurements to directly assess historic exposures.","['Armstrong, T W', 'Pearlman, E D', 'Schnatter, A R', 'Bowes, S M 3rd', 'Murray, N', 'Nicolich, M J']","['Armstrong TW', 'Pearlman ED', 'Schnatter AR', 'Bowes SM 3rd', 'Murray N', 'Nicolich MJ']","['Occupational Health Division, Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., East Millstone, NJ 08875-2350, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J,American Industrial Hygiene Association journal,0371160,"['0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods/standards', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/*poisoning', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Models, Statistical', '*Petroleum', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15428119691014864 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J. 1996 Apr;57(4):333-43. doi: 10.1080/15428119691014864.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus we suggest inhibitors of prostaglandine synthesis for therapy.","['Zernikow, B', 'Fleischack, G', 'Hasan, C', 'Bode, U']","['Zernikow B', 'Fleischack G', 'Hasan C', 'Bode U']","['Abteilung Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatskinderkinik.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Ischemia/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*drug therapy', 'Raynaud Disease/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Toes/*blood supply']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043994 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Mar-Apr;208(2):53-5. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043994.,,,,,,,,,,,,Zyanotisches Raynaud-Phanomen als Nebenwirkung von Amphotericin B.,,,,,,

While no particularly interesting pattern is suggested for Hodgkin's disease (even after considering specific Rye subgroups), multiple myeloma and leukemias, for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas the high rate in one agricultural area (Forli) was mainly due to the A sub-group in the Working Formulation (low-grade). In a heavily industrialized area (Varese), the high incidence rate was at least partly explained by a higher proportion of cases classified in the G sub-group (intermediate grade).

We have sequenced up to 1.6 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the TXAS gene and characterized the promoter activity in a human megakaryocyte cell line and endothelial cells. Our results demonstrated that the nucleotides -248/+137 relative to the major transcription start site conferred a full promoter activity of the TXAS gene.

We have investigated the effect of vitamin E supplementation on intact live eucaryotic cells. L1210 murine leukemia cells were exposed to an oxidative stress induced by 20 microM Fe2+ and 100 microM ascorbic acid introduced immediately before oxidative measurements were begun, and the kinetics of the generation of lipid-derived free radicals, as measured by EPR spin trapping (a product) and O2 consumption (a reactant) were measured. Cells grown for 24 h with supplemental (5-100 microM) vitamin E in their media had a slower rate of lipid radical generation compared to cells grown without vitamin E supplementation; this inhibition in the rate of oxidation was generally dependent upon the amount of vitamin E supplementation. In complementary studies measuring O2 consumption, 5-100 microM vitamin E slowed the rate of oxidation (10-fold with 100 microM supplemental vitamin E) consistent with the EPR studies. The membrane active drug edelfosine accentuated the vitamin E effects; vitamin E introduced a discernible lag phase (time delay) in both lipid radical generation and O2 consumption that was not seen in the absence of edelfosine. Vitamin E supplementation of cells also altered the kinetics of ascorbate free radical formation. We conclude that vitamin E inhibits lipid peroxidation in cells by slowing the rate of lipid peroxidation; but with iron/ascorbate as the initiating system, vitamin E does not delay the onset of peroxidation. Of special interest is that these free radical peroxidation events parallel cell membrane damage as detected using trypan blue exclusion. These observations are consistent with the free radical events preceding and causing the observed membrane damage.","['Wagner, B A', 'Buettner, G R', 'Burns, C P']","['Wagner BA', 'Buettner GR', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Oxides', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen Consumption/*drug effects', 'Pyridines', 'Spin Labels', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(96)90454-3 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1996.0454 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1996 Oct 15;334(2):261-7. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1996.0454.,,,"['HL49264/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have tested for evidence of anticipation in familial leukemia. Of 49 affected individuals in nine families transmitting autosomal dominant acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the mean age at onset is 57 years in the grandparental generation, 32 years in the parental generation, and 13 years in the youngest generation (P < .001). Of 21 parent-child pairs with AML, 19 show younger ages at onset in the child and demonstrate a mean decline in age at onset of 28 years (P < .001). Of 18 affected individuals from seven pedigrees with autosomal dominant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the mean age at onset in the parental generation is 66 years versus 51 years in the youngest generation (P = .008). Of nine parent-child pairs with CLL, eight show younger ages at onset in the child and reveal a mean decline in age at onset of 21 years (P = .001). Inspection of rare pedigrees transmitting acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple types of leukemia, and lymphoma is also compatible with anticipation. Sampling bias is unlikely to explain these findings. This suggests that dynamic mutation of unstable DNA sequence repeats could be a common mechanism of inherited hematopoietic malignancy with implications for the role of somatic mutation in the more frequent sporadic cases. We speculate on three possible candidate genes for familial leukemia with anticipation: a locus on 21q22.1-22.2, CBL2 on 11q23.3, and CBFB or a nearby gene on 16q22.","['Horwitz, M', 'Goode, E L', 'Jarvik, G P']","['Horwitz M', 'Goode EL', 'Jarvik GP']","['Division of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA. horwitz@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/03/29 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1996 Nov;59(5):990-8.,PMC1914843,,['HD0108-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Am J Hum Genet. 1997 May;60(5):1256-7.

This study demonstrates the importance of specific tyrosine residues in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor cytoplasmic domain in G-CSF-induced macrophage cell differentiation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a series of G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) mutants in which the tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine either singly or in combination. The mouse myeloid leukemic cell line (M1) transfected with G-CSF-R cDNA can be induced to differentiate into macrophages in response to G-CSF. The effect of the tyrosine mutations on this differentiation response was assessed by examining cell morphology and differentiation in soft agar colony assays. Although three of the four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues appeared to contribute to the differentiation response, mutation of a single residue (Tyr744) significantly reduced the ability of the M1 cells to differentiate. The STAT family of signaling molecules (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5) were activated by G-CSF in M1 cells expressing those G-CSF-R tyrosine mutants unable to mediate G-CSF-induced differentiation. Furthermore, activation of STAT proteins was shown to occur in the absence of all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, suggesting an alternative mechanism for STAT activation other than direct interaction with receptor phosphotyrosines.","['Nicholson, S E', 'Starr, R', 'Novak, U', 'Hilton, D J', 'Layton, J E']","['Nicholson SE', 'Starr R', 'Novak U', 'Hilton DJ', 'Layton JE']","['Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1996/10/25 00:00,1996/10/25 00:01,['1996/10/25 00:00'],"['1996/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.43.26947 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35404-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Oct 25;271(43):26947-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.43.26947.,,,['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this possibility, we examined the status of STAT and ERK proteins in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes following stimulation with bFGF or LIF. Both STAT1 and STAT3 as well as ERK1 and ERK2 proteins were detectable in extracts of myoblasts. LIF stimulation of myoblasts lead to rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of STAT3 and of ERKs 1 and 2. Similarly, bFGF stimulation of myoblasts resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. However, unlike LIF, the bFGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 appeared cyclical, with recurrent peaks of phosphorylation even after prolonged exposure. By contrast, STAT1 remained unphosphorylated in myoblasts treated with bFGF or LIF. In differentiated myotubes, LIF treatment resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT3 and STAT1, but ERK phosphorylation was not detectable, and bFGF treatment did not lead to STAT1 or STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation.

The present in vitro studies demonstrate that Ukrain is an effective biological response modifier augmenting, by up to 48-fold, the lytic activity of splenic lymphocytes obtained from alloimmunized mice. The lytic activities of interleukin-2 (IL-2) treated spleen cells and peritoneal exudate lymphocytes were also significantly increased by the addition of Ukrain to the cell mediated lysis (CML) assay medium. The highest Ukrain-induced enhancement of splenic lymphocytolytic activity in vitro was found to occur at day 18 after alloimmunization was dose-dependent and specific for the immunizing P815 tumour cells. Since Ukrain was present only during the CML assays, its mode of action is thought to be via direct activation of the effector cells' lytic mechanism(s). The effect of Ukrain on the growth of Balb/c syngenic mammary adenocarcinoma was also evaluated. Intravenous, but not subcutaneous or intraperitoneal, administration of this drug was found to be effective in delaying tumour growth in an actual therapeutic protocol initiated five days after tumour implantation. No deleterious side-effects were observed using these in vivo treatment modalities. The role of macrophages in the observed retardation of tumour development was investigated, using peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) in cytotoxicity assays. Previous studies showed that PEM of mammary tumour-bearing mice lose their capacity to kill a variety of tumour target cells including the in vitro cultured homologous tumour cells (DA-3). Pretreatment of PEM from normal mice with 2.5 microM Ukrain for 24 h, followed by stimulation with either IFN-gamma or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus IFN-gamma enhanced their cytotoxic activity. Treatment of PEM from tumour-bearing mice with 2.5 microM Ukrain and LPS results in a reversal of their defective cytotoxic response against DA-3 target cells. Furthermore, Ukrain alone, in the absence of a secondary signal, induced the activation of tumouricidal function of PEM from tumour-bearing, but not from normal, mice. These data indicate that Ukrain's in vivo effects against the development of mammary tumours may be due, at least in part, to its ability to restore macrophage cytolytic function.","['Liepins, A', 'Nowicky, J W']","['Liepins A', 'Nowicky JW']","[""Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Berberine Alkaloids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '6251Q9UK1S (ukrain)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Berberine Alkaloids', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenanthridines', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1996;22(3-5):103-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with aplastic anemia were conditioned with cyclophosphamide (CY), patients with CML were conditioned with a combination of CY and total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan. Sixty-three of the patients with aplastic anemia (54%) and 100 patients with CML (51%) were categorized as mixed chimeras based on the concurrent presence of donor and host lymphohematopoietic cells 14 days or later after transplantation. The TBI dose used for conditioning was inversely correlated with the development of mixed chimerism (P < 0.0001) among CML patients. No other patient- or transplant-related parameter was identified which contributed significantly to the development of mixed chimerism. The incidence of rejection was higher but not significantly so in patients with aplastic anemia who were mixed chimeras. The incidence of leukemic relapse in patients with CML who were mixed chimeras was increased only if mixed chimerism occurred after day 100 (P = 0.015). The incidence of acute GVHD (grades II-IV) was lower in mixed chimeras than in complete chimeras, but this difference was statistically significant only for patients with aplastic anemia given single-agent GVHD prophylaxis (P = 0.0008). Mixed chimeras in that group also had a better survival than complete chimeras, while no significant difference was observed in patients with aplastic anemia given drug combinations for GVHD prophylaxis. Among patients with CML, both overall survival (P = 0.03) and relapse-free survival (P = 0.04) were significantly superior in mixed than in complete chimeras. Thus, mixed chimerism was frequent among patients with aplastic anemia and with CML and was not uniformly associated with graft failure or leukemic relapse. The interaction between conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis and chimerism are complex. The survival advantage of mixed chimeras is only in part related to a lower incidence of GVHD and other factors are likely to contribute.","['Huss, R', 'Deeg, H J', 'Gooley, T', 'Bryant, E', 'Leisenring, W', 'Clift, R', 'Buckner, C D', 'Martin, P', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Huss R', 'Deeg HJ', 'Gooley T', 'Bryant E', 'Leisenring W', 'Clift R', 'Buckner CD', 'Martin P', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Results from a retrospective analysis.,761-5,"Cilastatin, an inhibitor of the tubular brush border enzyme dehydropeptidase-I, is added in a fixed combination to imipenem. Cilastatin has been demonstrated in different animal models and in one clinical trial, to reduce the nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporin A. To evaluate a possible nephroprotective effect of cilastatin following allogeneic BMT we conducted a retrospective analysis of 104 patients transplanted in our BMT Unit from January 1991 to January 1995. Imipenem/cilastatin (I/C) was used in a non-randomized manner in 64 patients during this period. Acute renal failure (ARF) was diagnosed in 32 patients (30%). ARF was not associated with gender, sepsis, conditioning regimen, underlying disease, bilirubin, or age. VOD occurred in 12/32 (37.5%) of patients with ARF whereas it occurred in only 7/72 (9.7%) of patients without ARF (P < 0.0007). ARF was not correlated with use of aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ciprofloxacine, ceftazidime or amphotericin-B. However, 13 patients of 64 exposed to I/C (20.3%) developed ARF vs 19 of 40 patients (47.5%) who were not exposed to I/C (P < 0.003; OR 0.28). Stratified analysis and multiple logistic regression confirmed the I/C nephroprotective action. The mean cyclosporin A levels in the I/C group were significantly decreased (208.6 +/- 64.9) vs the non-I/C group (265 +/- 118). We conclude that these results suggest I/C may counteract acute cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity following BMT and further prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm if routine administration of cilastatine confers benefit in the BMT setting.","['Gruss, E', 'Tomas, J F', 'Bernis, C', 'Rodriguez, F', 'Traver, J A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Gruss E', 'Tomas JF', 'Bernis C', 'Rodriguez F', 'Traver JA', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Department of Nephrology, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '141A6AMN38 (Cilastatin)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/physiology', 'Cilastatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kidney/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Oct;18(4):761-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The actuarial probabilities of development of acute and chronic GVHD were 57% and 47%, respectively. Twenty-six patients died of transplant-related complications at a median of 3.5 months, and two of unrelated causes. Seventeen patients relapsed at a median of 6.5 months. Forty patients were alive and well at 74-197 months (median 157) after BMT; seven (18%) with limited chronic GVHD requiring therapy. The actuarial 10-year probabilities of transplant-related death, relapse, and disease-free survival were 33%, 25% and 48% respectively. In multivariate analysis, infusion of a lower cell dose, development of GVHD, and age > 35 years were associated with increased transplant-related mortality, donor-recipient ABO incompatibility with a lower relapse rate, and age > 35 years and a lower cell dose with poorer disease-free survival. We conclude that with long-term follow-up, allografting in AML after cyclophosphamide-TBI and cyclosporine has resulted in disease-free survival that is comparable to most currently reported series. Patients who are alive and well 3-4 years after BMT have excellent prospects of long-term survival.","['Mehta, J', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Horton, C', 'Tait, D', 'Meller, S', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Middleton, G', 'Eisen, T', 'Singhal, S']","['Mehta J', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Horton C', 'Tait D', 'Meller S', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Middleton G', 'Eisen T', 'Singhal S']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Oct;18(4):741-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, effects of reduced and oxidized folates on the development of resistance to a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor, N10-propargyl-5, 8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717), were examined in the human leukemia cell line MOLT-3. MOLT-3 cells were made resistant to CB3717 by soft-agar cloning in RPMI-1640 medium with either pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) or a more physiological folate (10 nM leucovorin). A 40-fold CB3717-resistant subline developed in PGA (MOLT-3/CB3717(40)-PGA) showed amplification of the TS gene with a concomitant increased level in the gene expression. A 200-fold CB3717-resistant subline (MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-PGA), which was derived from MOLT-3/CB3717(40)-PGA, showed further enhancement of amplification of the TS gene. In contrast, even a 200-fold CB3717-resistant subline developed in leucovorin (MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-LV) showed neither amplification nor overexpression of the TS gene. Both MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-PGA and MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-LV cells showed decreased membrane transport of PGA as well as methotrexate. These results suggest that the types of folates used during the development of CB3717 resistance may play a role in resistance, and that impaired transport of PGA, in CB3717-resistant MOLT-3 cells developed in PGA, might have accelerated amplification of the TS gene.","['Miyachi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Ando, Y']","['Miyachi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Ando Y']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/adverse effects/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01209028 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1996;122(11):659-64. doi: 10.1007/BF01209028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Finnish Leukaemia Group.,247-53,"A long plateau phase is one of the strongest signs predicting long survival in multiple myeloma. The kinetics of escape from the plateau is, however, poorly known, and so is its influence on subsequent survival. During a 9-yr follow-up of 432 myeloma patients the serum M-protein doubling time at first relapse was measured from serial observations in 137 cases. Univariate and multivariate analyses of pretreatment characteristics and of characteristics associated with chemotherapy were used to identify the predictors influencing on M-protein doubling time. In 65 patients the M-protein doubling time was 6 months or less and in 72 longer, with median remaining survival times of 17 and 45 months, respectively; 50% of the former group had any response to salvage chemotherapy, compared to 75% of the latter group. In univariate analysis stage and Hb were significant predictors for the M-protein doubling time. An at least 75% response was associated with short doubling time. However, the multivariate analysis left only a long preceding plateau and use of several drug combinations during primary chemotherapy as significant predictors for a long M-protein doubling time. A M-protein doubling time of 6 months or less is associated with frequent resistance to salvage chemotherapy and short remaining survival. A short doubling of the M-protein is preceded by a short plateau. The use of several drug combinations during primary chemotherapy does not jeopardize the later course of the disease.

In order to define the role of the MDM-2 gene in the pathogenesis of human acute myeloid leukemia, the expression and the sequence of the MDM-2 gene were examined in samples of bone marrow and/or peripheral mononuclear cells of 38 patients by using immunostaining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining detected a weak accumulation of the MDM-2 protein in AML patients of FAB classification M4 and M5. RT-PCR analysis revealed a heterogeneous expression pattern of MDM-2 mRNA in AML samples of different FAB classification. An increased level of MDM-2 mRNA expression was observed in 17 of 38 AML patients when compared to normal controls. No structural changes in a 488 bp region extending from nucleotide 890 to 1378 of the MDM-2 cDNA were detected using RT-SSCP and sequence analysis. In addition, heterogeneous expression of p53 transcripts was found with the highest p53 mRNA levels in AML M4 and M5. Interestingly, there seems to be a correlation between the relative ratios of p53 and MDM-2 mRNA levels in AML M4 and M5: in 15 of 23 cases high p53 mRNA expression was directly associated with high levels of MDM-2 transcripts. An exclusively intranuclear p53 immunostaining pattern was found in 10 of 16 (58%) AML FAB M4 and M5, whereas the remaining AML samples tested were negative for p53 (0/10). Using RT-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of the RT-PCR amplification products of p53 exon 5-8, we observed that only 1 of 38 AML patients showed a point mutation in the p53 gene. This missense mutation occurred in the evolutionary highly conserved region of p53 at codon 255 (Ile to Phe). These data indicated that structural alterations of the p53 gene do not play an important role in the initiation and progression of AML. However, abrogation of p53 tumor suppressor function due to MDM-2 overexpression may be an alternative molecular mechanism by which a subset of AMLs may escape from p53-regulated growth control.","['Seliger, B', 'Papadileris, S', 'Vogel, D', 'Hess, G', 'Brendel, C', 'Storkel, S', 'Ortel, J', 'Kolbe, K', 'Huber, C', 'Huhn, D', 'Neubauer, A']","['Seliger B', 'Papadileris S', 'Vogel D', 'Hess G', 'Brendel C', 'Storkel S', 'Ortel J', 'Kolbe K', 'Huber C', 'Huhn D', 'Neubauer A']","['Johannes Gutenberg-University, IIIrd Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01369.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Sep;57(3):230-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01369.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They inhibit the action of MMPs on extracellular matrix components. The balance of MMPs and TIMPs is important for tissue remodeling and its disturbance is believed to play a crucial role in pathophysiological processes such as tumor metastasis, destruction of cartilage and fibrosis. Cytokines and growth factors were found to regulate TIMPs and MMPs in a complex manner. In order to better understand the role of TIMPs in inflammatory joint diseases we have studied in vitro the regulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 by inflammatory cytokines in cultured human synovial lining cells. We found that transforming growth factor beta 1 as well as interleukin-1 beta induce gene expression of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-3. In contrast, oncostatin M, an interleukin-6-type cytokine produced by activated T-lymphocytes and monocytes, had a differential effect on TIMP mRNA levels. After oncostatin M treatment, TIMP-1 expression was up-regulated but basal, as well as interleukin-1 beta-induced, TIMP-3 expression was inhibited. Interleukin-6 itself had no effect on synovial lining cells but a complex of interleukin-6 and the soluble interleukin-6 receptor induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors in these cells and regulated TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 expression in a similar fashion as oncostatin M. Since TIMP-3 is matrix-associated whereas TIMP-1 is found in many body fluids, the role of oncostatin M during inflammatory processes might be to promote ECM degradation in the local environment but to prevent it systemically.","['Gatsios, P', 'Haubeck, H D', 'Van de Leur, E', 'Frisch, W', 'Apte, S S', 'Greiling, H', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Graeve, L']","['Gatsios P', 'Haubeck HD', 'Van de Leur E', 'Frisch W', 'Apte SS', 'Greiling H', 'Heinrich PC', 'Graeve L']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Knee', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0056t.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Oct 1;241(1):56-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0056t.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined annexin II expression in II human B-cell lymphoma cell lines and in normal B-cells. Wide variation was observed in the levels of annexin II in these cell lines. Annexin II overexpression was observed in 5 cell lines, while significantly reduced expression was observed in Raji, OMA-BL-1 and REH cell lines. Analysis of the annexin II gene, mRNA and protein in Raji and OMA-BL-1 cell lines indicated that annexin II gene was unaltered and that a low level of annexin II transcripts are produced in these cells. Down-regulation of annexin II expression was at the transcriptional level, and no reexpression of annexin II was observed after treatment of cells with demethylating agents. Thus methylation of the annexin II gene does not appear to be responsible for annexin II down-regulation. A slow migrating altered form of annexin II was detected in Raji and OMA-BL-1 cells, which was detected with the anti-chicken annexin II antiserum, but not with the anti-human annexin II antiserum. The slow migrating annexin II species was found to be sensitive to dephosphorylation by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, resulting in reduction of the size of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The phosphorylated annexin II was also observed in nuclear extracts of human K562 and HeLa cells. Thus, Raji and OMA-BL-1 cells exclusively produce a phosphorylated form of annexin II, and phosphorylated annexin II may be important for cell survival and proliferation.","['Chiang, Y', 'Davis, R G', 'Vishwanatha, J K']","['Chiang Y', 'Davis RG', 'Vishwanatha JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-4525, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Annexin A2/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/11 00:00,1996/10/11 00:01,['1996/10/11 00:00'],"['1996/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(96)00103-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(96)00103-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Oct 11;1313(3):295-301. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(96)00103-6.,,,['GM46459/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, neuropeptide gene expression is similarly increased by exposure to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). The effect of IL-1 in-vitro has been shown to be mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Since IL-1 regulates neuropeptide expression via LIF in vitro, we asked whether axotomy in vivo produces an increase in LIF mRNA, and whether that increase is regulated by IL-1 activity. Within 6 h following axotomy, ganglionic LIF mRNA is substantially elevated. Moreover, axotomy produces a rapid and transient increase in intraganglionic IL-1 beta mRNA, followed rapidly by an increase in ICAM-1 mRNA, thereby suggesting a local source of IL-1 activity. Pretreatment with the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DEX) reduces the increases of both IL-1 beta and LIF mRNAs following axotomy. mRNA encoding the specific signal-transducing Type I IL-1 receptor is present in unlesioned SCG in vivo, and increases following axotomy. Local application of IL-1 beta in vivo induces LIF mRNA even in uninjured ganglia, though not to the extent seen with axotomy. DEX treatment blocks this IL-1 beta-mediated increase in LIF mRNA. Therefore, DEX blocks the induction of LIF mRNA by inhibiting both the production of IL-1 and its action on LIF gene expression. Axotomy of a homozygous IL-1 receptor type I gene knockout mouse leads to a delayed and/or diminished induction of LIF mRNA in SCG, but does not prevent LIF mRNA expression. We conclude that while IL-1 is likely to be involved in the cascade of gene expression that follows axotomy, it alone is not sufficient to mediate the full induction of LIF mRNA by axotomy.","['Carlson, C D', 'Bai, Y', 'Ding, M', 'Jonakait, G M', 'Hart, R P']","['Carlson CD', 'Bai Y', 'Ding M', 'Jonakait GM', 'Hart RP']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Denervation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Inflammation/physiopathology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/01 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-5728(96)00115-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-5728(96)00115-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 1996 Nov;70(2):181-90. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(96)00115-4.,,,"['MH00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH51564/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30560/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['GENBANK/M98820'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these questions, we have generated a null mutation of the only known mammalian DNA methyltransferase gene through homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells and found that the development of the homozygous embryos is arrested prior to the 8-somite stage. Surprisingly, the null mutant embryonic stem cells are viable and contain low but stable levels of methyl cytosine and methyltransferase activity, suggesting the existence of a second DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells. Further studies indicate that de novo methylation activity is not impaired by the mutation as integrated provirus DNA in MoMuLV-infected homozygous embryonic stem cells become methylated at a similar rate as in wild-type cells. Differentiation of mutant cells results in further reduction of methyl cytosine levels, consistent with the de novo methylation activity being down regulated in differentiated cells. These results provide the first evidence that an independently encoded DNA methyltransferase is present in mammalian cells which is capable of de novo methylating cellular and viral DNA in vivo.","['Lei, H', 'Oh, S P', 'Okano, M', 'Juttermann, R', 'Goss, K A', 'Jaenisch, R', 'Li, E']","['Lei H', 'Oh SP', 'Okano M', 'Juttermann R', 'Goss KA', 'Jaenisch R', 'Li E']","['Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital-East, Charlestown 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Cytosine Methylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Proviruses/genetics']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1996 Oct;122(10):3195-205.,,,"['F32 HD07945-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'GM52106/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA44339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 2) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2) who developed hepatosplenic fungal disease, and were treated with antifungal medication, underwent MRI examination on a 1.5 T MR imager. MR images were prospectively evaluated and correlated with liver biopsy (three patients), and clinical picture (one patient). RESULTS: Multiple liver lesions measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter were identified in all patients. Lesions possessed a distinctive MR appearance: central mild hyperintensity with a peripheral ring of very low signal intensity on precontrast T1- and T2-weighted images. The central region of the lesions enhanced following gadolinium administration with the peripheral ring remaining low in signal intensity. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing fungal granulomas in the liver of patients with transfusional hemosiderosis on treatment with antifungal antibiotics have a distinctive appearance of moderate high signal intensity center on T1- and T2-weighted and postgadolinium MR images with a peripheral rim of low signal intensity. This appearance reflects the presence of iron-laden macrophages in the periphery of granulomas and may be expected in processes that initiate an immune response involving aggregation of macrophages in the liver of patients with transfusional iron overload.","['Kelekis, N L', 'Semelka, R C', 'Jeon, H J', 'Sallah, A S', 'Shea, T C', 'Woosley, J T']","['Kelekis NL', 'Semelka RC', 'Jeon HJ', 'Sallah AS', 'Shea TC', 'Woosley JT']","['Department of Radiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7510, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Magn Reson Imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging,8214883,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granuloma/diagnosis', 'Hemosiderosis/*complications/etiology', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Liver/*pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0730-725X(96)00090-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0730-725x(96)00090-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Magn Reson Imaging. 1996;14(6):615-8. doi: 10.1016/0730-725x(96)00090-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fura-2 loaded HEL cells responded to 2-methylthio ATP, ATP, 2-methylthio ADP, ADP and UTP with an increase in intracellular calcium. 2 Methylthio ADP was the most potent agonist. When external calcium was chelated with EDTA, calcium responses were observed indicating the mobilization of intracellular stores. These responses showed evidence of both homologous and heterologous receptor desensitization. In photoaffinity labeling experiments, beta-[32P]-AzPET-ADP was incorporated into three protein species with mobilities corresponding to M(r) approximately 55 kDa (doublet) and approximately 43 kDa. Labeling of approximately 55 kDa proteins was specifically inhibited by ADP, while that of the approximately 43 kDa was inhibited specifically by UTP. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the positive clones obtained by screening the HEL cell cDNA library with mouse P2U cDNA revealed that the P2U receptor from HEL cells is identical to the previously cloned human P2U receptor. These experiments suggest that the HEL cells contain a P2Y purinoceptor responding to ADP, in addition to a P2U receptor and possibly also a third P2 purinoceptor with a unique agonist profile.","['Akbar, G K', 'Dasari, V R', 'Sheth, S B', 'Ashby, B', 'Mills, D C', 'Kunapuli, S P']","['Akbar GK', 'Dasari VR', 'Sheth SB', 'Ashby B', 'Mills DC', 'Kunapuli SP']","['Department of Physiology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*analysis/classification/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10799899609039949 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 1996 May-Jul;16(3-4):209-24. doi: 10.3109/10799899609039949.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether myristylation of FBR v-fos contributes to in vivo tumorigenicity, we examined its transforming capability in comparison to a nonmyristylated FBR v-fos (G2A-R). Retroviral infections with FBR v-fos and G2A-R transform BALB/c-3T3 cells. The number, size, and cellular morphology of foci generated by both FBR and G2A-R are indistinguishable. However, marked biological differences were found in transgenic mice expressing either the myristylated FBR v-fos or the nonmyristylated G2A-R. 11 of 26 FBR v-fos transgenic mice died as a result of gross tumor burden. None of the 28 G2A-R transgenic mice died from tumor burden, and only two of the G2A-R mice developed bone tumors. Histologic examination of the tumors reveals that the FBR v-fos bone tumors contain malignant cells with features of four cell lineages (osteocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes) in an environment rich in extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the G2A-R tumors exist in an environment devoid of ECM and display malignant cells with features of adipocytes. Masson staining reveals that the ECM of the FBR tumors stains strongly for collagen. Immunohistochemical staining with collagen III antibody demonstrates an abundance of collagen III expression in this ECM. While NH2-terminal myristylation is not required for FBR immortalization and transformation, it is essential in determining the degree of differentiation and tumorigenicity of malignant cells.","['Jotte, R M', 'Holt, J T']","['Jotte RM', 'Holt JT']","['Department of Cell Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-fos)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-fos/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.135.2.457 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Oct;135(2):457-67. doi: 10.1083/jcb.135.2.457.,PMC2121035,,"['523C-MO 7347-14/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01CA51735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Varicella vaccine was safe, immunogenic, and effective in leukemic children at risk for serious disease or death from chickenpox. The major side effect was mild rash in 50% approximately 1 month after immunization. About 40% of children who developed rash were treated with acyclovir. Vaccine efficacy was judged by the degree of protection after a household exposure to varicella; of 123 exposed children, 17 (14%) developed a mild form of varicella. The vaccine protected completely against severe varicella. Leukemic vaccines were less likely to develop zoster than were comparable children with leukemia who had wild type varicella.

In 3.5-day-old mutant embryos, cultured in vitro, progressive depletion of CAN leads to cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, and eventually to blastocoel collapse, impaired NLS-mediated protein uptake and nuclear accumulation of polyadenylated RNA. Remarkably, these defective CAN-depleted embryos do not display any gross morphological abnormalities in their nuclear envelopes or NPCs.

To examine the role of nm23 in human myeloid leukemia, we investigated the relative levels of nm23-H1, nm23-H2, and c-myc transcripts in 42 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and in 5 with chronic myelogenous leukemia at chronic phase by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expression of nm23-H1 and -H2 but not of c-myc in AML was significantly higher than that in normal blood cells. Among AMLs, acute monocytic leukemia (presentation with AML-M5 morphology) was especially associated with elevated nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA levels. On the other hand, the elevated levels of c-myc expression in AML-M5 were less evident. An analysis of correlation between nm23 expression and clinicopathological parameters showed that resistance to initial chemotherapy is associated with increased nm23-H1 mRNA levels and that a high initial white blood cell count is associated with increased nm23-H2 mRNA levels. Elevated nm23-H1 mRNA levels were associated with significantly reduced the overall survival of AML, especially of AML-M5 patients.

We cloned the proximal 10p breakpoint from one patient and showed that the MLL gene at 11q23 was fused to the 3' portion of AF10 at 10p12. In addition, we cloned the telomeric 10p junction and we found that the 5' portion of AF10 was juxtaposed to a previously unidentified gene at 11q12, which we call HEAB (a human homolog to a hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans ATP/GTP-binding protein). These results indicate that the AF10 gene is split into a 5' AF10 and a 3' AF10 portion by the 11q23q12 chromosome segment and that both breakpoint junctions result in fusion transcripts of 5' AF10/HEAB and MLL/3' AF10. Only the MLL/3' AF10 fusion mRNA results in an in-frame fusion. Northern blot analysis of HEAB expression shows that a 2.0-kb major transcript is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is especially abundant in testis and skeletal muscle, whereas a 3.2-kb minor transcript is noted with the highest level of expression in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. The HEAB gene encodes a 425-amino acid protein that is rich in valine and leucine. HEAB protein shows high homology in its entire amino acid sequence to a putative C elegans protein and contains an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif that has homology to the ATP-binding transporter superfamily or to GTP-binding proteins. Our results could explain the high frequency of complex insertion and other rearrangement events that involve 10p12 and 11q12 and 11q23.

FLT3 receptor mRNA is found in early hematopoietic progenitors and in human myeloid leukemia blasts. Much less is known about the surface expression of FLT3 receptor on human hematopoietic cells. Using human 125I-FLT3 ligand, we have identified and characterized surface FLT3 receptors on normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells and cell lines. Our results showed that surface display of FLT3 receptor was greatest in fresh myeloid leukemia blast cells and myeloid leukemia cell lines. Erythroleukemic and megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines (n = 5) bound little to no 125I-FLT3 ligand. Scatchard analysis of 125I-FLT3 ligand binding data shows that three myeloid leukemia cell lines, ML-1, AML-193, and HL-60, as well as normal human marrow mononuclear cells, exhibit high affinity FLT3 receptors. Crosslinking of 125I-FLT3 ligand to FLT3 receptors on the surface of ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells indicates that the FLT3 ligand. The rates of FLT3 ligand internalization and degradation were determined by binding 125I-FLT3 ligand to ML-1 cells and acid stripping to distinguish surface bound from internalized ligand. Internalized 125I-FLT3 ligand was detected within 5 minutes after binding to ML-1 cells. In addition, we evaluated the effect of FLT3 ligand on megakaryocytic colony growth and nuclear endoreduplication, alone or in the presence of thrombopoietin. FLT3 ligand did not promote colony forming unit megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg) colony growth or megakaryocyte nuclear maturation, nor did FLT3 ligand augment the effects of thrombopoietin on these measures of megakaryopoiesis. These data indicate that the FLT3 receptor shares several characteristics with the c-kit receptor including dimerization and rapid internalization. However, the more restricted cellular distribution of the FLT3 receptor may target the effects of FLT3 ligand to primitive hematopoietic cells and to myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells, in contrast to the pleiotropic effects of the c-kit receptor ligand, stem cell factor.","['Turner, A M', 'Lin, N L', 'Issarachai, S', 'Lyman, S D', 'Broudy, V C']","['Turner AM', 'Lin NL', 'Issarachai S', 'Lyman SD', 'Broudy VC']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61351-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 1;88(9):3383-90.,,,"['CA61578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44194/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MO 1-RR000 37/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the putative role of eosinophils on tumor cell regulation in HD, we have analyzed these cells for the functional expression of CD30 ligand (CD30L), a surface molecule able to transduce CD30-mediated proliferation signals on Hodgkin's (H) and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. The results demonstrate that circulating and tissue eosinophils from normal donors and patients with HD or hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), display CD30L mRNA and express CD30L protein, as shown by immunostaining with a specific monoclonal antibody (M80) and with a biotinylated soluble CD30-Fc fusion protein. The surface density of CD30L on eosinophils from HD and HES patients was remarkably higher compared with healthy donors, probably reflecting a cytokine-mediated upregulation in these pathologic conditions. Accordingly, we provide evidence that cytokines regulating eosinophils proliferation and activation, ie, interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), are able to enhance the cellular density of CD30L on purified eosinophils from normal subjects. Finally, we show that native CD30L on human eosinophils is a functionally active surface structure able to transduce proliferative signals on CD30+ target cells, including cultured H-RS cells. Our data suggest that eosinophils may not merely represent innocent bystanders, but rather act as important elements in the pathology of HD by contributing to the deregulated network of CD30/CD30L-mediated interactive signals between H-RS cells and surrounding reactive cells.","['Pinto, A', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Gloghini, A', 'Zagonel, V', 'Degan, M', 'Improta, S', 'Juzbasic, S', 'Todesco, M', 'Perin, V', 'Gattei, V', 'Herrmann, F', 'Gruss, H J', 'Carbone, A']","['Pinto A', 'Aldinucci D', 'Gloghini A', 'Zagonel V', 'Degan M', 'Improta S', 'Juzbasic S', 'Todesco M', 'Perin V', 'Gattei V', 'Herrmann F', 'Gruss HJ', 'Carbone A']","['Leukemia Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD30 Ligand)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFSF8 protein, human)']",IM,"['CD30 Ligand', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61341-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Nov 1;88(9):3299-305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality in this cohort has been under study since 1950. Deaths are routinely identified through the family registry system and ascertainment is virtually complete. Cancer incidence data for the LSS cohort are also available from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki population-based tumour registry established in 1958. The central finding of the LSS is an increase in cancer risk. Besides the well-known increase in leukaemia, increases in solid cancer such as cancers of the lung, breast, stomach and thyroid have also been demonstrated. Radiation-induced leukaemia occurred 2 to 3 years after exposure, reached its peak within 6 to 8 years after the bombing, and has since declined steadily. However, this has not been true of solid cancer. Radiation-induced solid cancer begins to appear at later ages than such cancer is normally prone to develop, and continues to increase proportionally with the increase in mortality or incidence in the control group as it ages. Survivors who were exposed in the first or second decade of life have just entered the cancer-prone age and have so far exhibited a high relative risk in association with radiation dose. Whether the elevated risk will continue or will fail with time is not yet clear. It is important to continue long-term follow-up of this cohort to document the changes with time since exposure. Beyond cancer risk, increased risk of non-cancer mortality is also suggested, although it is not conclusive.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Mabuchi, K', 'Preston, D L', 'Shigematsu, I']","['Shimizu Y', 'Mabuchi K', 'Preston DL', 'Shigematsu I']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,World Health Stat Q,World health statistics quarterly.

However, the occurrence of primary or secondary GC resistance limits their clinical usefulness. Prior investigations into the mechanism of GC resistance in established human leukemic cell lines revealed loss-of-function mutations in the GC receptor (GR) gene. In this study, we analyzed the GC-resistant human acute T-cell leukemia line CEM-C1, which has been reported to express biochemically functional GR and, thus, was thought to owe its GC resistance to signal transduction changes distal from the GR. Radioligand binding assays revealed a 2-3-fold lower expression of GR in CEM-C1 than in the GC-sensitive sister cell line CEM-C7H2. Analysis of transcriptional activity using mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat-controlled chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transient transfection assays confirmed the expression of functional GR in CEM-C1 but at levels lower than those in CEM-C7H2 cells. Upon molecular analyses of the GR gene and its transcripts, we found that CEM-C1 cells were heterozygous for the ligand binding domain L753F point mutation in exon 9, which is also present in GC-sensitive CEM-C7H2. No mutations, however, were found on the second GR allele of CEM-C1. To test the possibility that resistance in CEM-C1 cells might be caused by insufficient expression of GR, we established several cell lines stably transfected with rat GR expression vectors. These cell lines differed in exogenous GR expression as determined by Northern blotting and radioligand binding assays. The GR expression level in individual lines correlated well with their sensitivity to GC-induced apoptosis. Thus, GC resistance of CEM-C1 cells might be due to subthreshold expression of functional GR rather than defects in signal transduction pathways distal from the GR. Since several clinical investigations showed a correlation between reduced GR expression and poor response to GC-containing treatment, the CEM-C1 line may represent a valid model for GC resistance in human acute T-cell leukemia.","['Geley, S', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Hala, M', 'Strasser-Wozak, E M', 'Kapelari, K', 'Kofler, R']","['Geley S', 'Hartmann BL', 'Hala M', 'Strasser-Wozak EM', 'Kapelari K', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Medical School, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Nov 1;56(21):5033-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that flavopiridol is cytostatic but not cytotoxic when applied to exponentially growing cells. In the present study, various human tumor cell lines were assayed for trypan blue exclusion and ability to form colonies after exposure to flavopiridol under a variety of growth conditions. When log phase A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells were examined 72 h after the start of a 24-h flavopiridol exposure, as many as 90% of the cells accumulated trypan blue. A 24-h exposure to 250-300 nM resulted in trypan blue uptake in 50% of A549 cells at 72 h and a 50% reduction in colony formation. Similar results were observed in HCT8 ileocecal adenocarcinoma, T98G glioblastoma, MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, and HL-60 leukemia cells. With A549 cells, identical results were obtained in actively growing logarithmic phase cells and growth-arrested confluent cells. Treatment with the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin only minimally affected the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol. In contrast, the RNA synthesis inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reduced the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol. These results suggest that: (a) flavopiridol is not only cytostatic, but also cytotoxic to a variety of human tumor cell lines; (b) flavopiridol is equally active against cycling and noncycling A549 cells; and (c) RNA and protein synthesis appear to play a role in flavopiridol-induced cytotoxicity.","['Bible, K C', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Bible KC', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Nov 1;56(21):4856-61.,,,"['U01 CA66084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA66912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results suggest that MEL cells are capable of supporting human gamma expression, despite their predominantly adult phenotype.","['Flamm, M', 'Bornschlegel, K', 'Wu, S', ""O'Neill, D"", 'Bank, A']","['Flamm M', 'Bornschlegel K', 'Wu S', ""O'Neill D"", 'Bank A']","['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aging/blood/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Cosmids/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Switch', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<181::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<181::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-V [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Nov;53(3):181-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<181::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-V.,,,"['5K08 HL02547/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 25274/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous data suggested that CD34 expression may be associated with other poor prognosis factors in AML such as undifferentiated leukemia, secondary AML (SAML), and clonal abnormalities involving chromosome 5 and 7. In order to analyze the correlations between the clinicopathologic features, cytogenetic and CD34 expression in AML, we retrospectively investigated 99 patients with newly diagnosed AML: 85 with de novo disease and 14 with secondary AML (SAML). Eighty-six patients who received the same induction chemotherapy were available for clinical outcome. Defining a case as positive when > or = 20% of bone marrow cells collected at diagnosis expressed the CD34 antigen, forty-five patients were included in the CD34 positive group. Ninety patients had adequate cytogenetic analysis. Thirty-two patients (72%) with CD34 positive AML exhibited an abnormal karyotype whereas 15 patients (28%) with CD34 negative AML had abnormal metaphases (P < 0.01). Monosomy 7/7q- or monosomy 5/5q- occurred in 10 patients and 8 of them expressed the CD34 antigen (P < 0.05). All patients with t(8;21) which is considered as a favorable factor in AML had levels of CD34 >/= 20% (P < 0.05). We did not find any association between CD34 expression and attainment of complete remission, overall survival, or disease-free survival. In conclusion, the variations of CD34 expression in AML are correlated with cytogenetic abnormalities associated both with poor and favorable outcome.

The sensitivity of cytogenetics is fairly similar to that of Southern detection of M-BCR rearrangement (5%); this last technique has the potential advantage of being independent of cell division and yield of metaphases. IFN alpha treatment can induce lack of growth of hemopoietic precursors and poor yield of metaphases has been observed. For this reason we decided to study the grade of concordance and complementarity between analysis of karyotype and detection of M-BCR rearrangement of Southern blot. We studied 43 Ph1 positive, M-BCR positive pre-BMT CML patients (48 samples) treated with IFN alpha 2a. Karyotype was done on bone marrow cells by direct method, culture, and banding. Southern technique was performed onto DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes treated with BgIII (and Xbal if necessary) and hybridized with the universal probe (Ph1/bcr-3, Transprobe 1) labelled with dCTP32. A highly significant association between both tests was obtained. Of 48 samples analyzed, 34 were evaluable by both methods and 28 gave the same result for both tests. The concordance between the tests was good (kappa index: 0.63). Of total samples 27.1% was not evaluable by cytogenetics; this figure was 31.2% in samples from patients who were previously in complete cytogenetic response. All of the specimens not evaluable by karyotyping were evaluable by Southern. One sample was not analyzable by Southern but it was evaluable by cytogenetic analysis. The information obtained by Southern technique was clinically relevant, and decisions were made according to its results. We conclude that both tests show a significant association and a good concordance, although they are not interchangeable. Cytogenetic and molecular studies are complementary and must be employed together in CML patients treated with alpha-interferon.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Requena, M J', 'Casado, L F', 'Pico, M', 'Penarrubia, M J', 'Ferro, M T', 'Resino, M', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Steegmann JL', 'Requena MJ', 'Casado LF', 'Pico M', 'Penarrubia MJ', 'Ferro MT', 'Resino M', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Hematology Department, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<169::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<169::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-X [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Nov;53(3):169-74. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199611)53:3<169::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of Op18 is cell cycle regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and expression of a 'CDK target site-deficient mutant' results in a phenotype indicative of a role for Op18 during mitosis. This phenotype is compatible with the idea that Op18 is a phosphorylation-responsive regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed MTs in cells induced to express either wild-type or mutated Op18. The results showed that wild-type Op18 and a CDK target site mutant both efficiently elicited rapid depolymerization of MTs. This result contrasts with clear-cut differences in their cell cycle phenotypes. Morphological analysis of MTs explained this apparent discrepancy: while interphase MTs were depolymerized in cells expressing either Op18 derivative, apparently normal mitotic spindles were formed only in cells overexpressing wild-type Op18. This result correlates with our finding that only mutated Op18 causes a block during mitosis. Hence, we conclude that Op18 decreases MT stability and that this activity of Op18 is subject to cell cycle regulation by CDKs.","['Marklund, U', 'Larsson, N', 'Gradin, H M', 'Brattsand, G', 'Gullberg, M']","['Marklund U', 'Larsson N', 'Gradin HM', 'Brattsand G', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Tubulin)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Metaphase', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymers/analysis', 'Stathmin', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Oct 1;15(19):5290-8.,PMC452273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tal-1 gene product is a serine phosphoprotein and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor known to regulate embryonic hematopoiesis. We have established a transgenic mouse model in which tal-1 mis-expression in the thymus results in the development of clonal T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Thus, overexpression of tal-1 alone can be transforming, verifying its pathogenic role in human T-ALL. In addition, leukemogenesis is accelerated dramatically by transgenic co-expression of tal-1 and the catalytic subunit of casein kinase IIalpha (CKIIalpha), a serine/threonine protein kinase known to modulate the activity of other bHLH transcription factors. Although tal-1 is a substrate for CKII, the synergy of the tal-1 and CKIIalpha transgenes appears to be indirect, perhaps mediated through the E protein heterodimeric partners of tal-1.

The phenotype of these cells closely resembled that of typical adult T-cell leukemia cells and tax-immortalized human T cells; i.e., positive for CD3, CD4 and IL-2 receptor alpha-chain. Chromosomal analysis revealed that about 10% of the tax-transduced T cells had several chromosomal abnormalities. We also performed in vivo characterization of tax-transduced splenocytes by injecting them into newborn syngeneic rats soon after in vitro infection. Maintenance of the injected tax-transduced cell population and in vivo expression of the tax gene was confirmed in the splenocytes of the injected rats by polymerase chain reaction. However, development of obvious disease was not observed in these rats for up to 18 months after inoculation.

Transcriptional induction of the RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR mRNAs is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins. Up-regulation of RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR gene expression by IFN(alpha) is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers, i.e., granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor mRNA and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase. However, IFN(alpha) does not have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33. The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells, since the phenomena are not observed in HL-60 promyelocytes. Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells, although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity.

This oncoprotein consists of almost the entire DEK protein fused to the C-terminal two-thirds of the CAN protein. In much the same way, CAN is fused to SET in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia, producing a SET-CAN fusion protein. Interestingly, CAN is associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and we recently established its crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport processes and cell cycle progression. As a first step in the biochemical analysis of the oncogenic mechanism associated with translocation (6;9), we set out to identify proteins that interact with CAN and its fusion proteins. We found that two proteins specifically co-immunoprecipitate with CAN. One had a molecular mass of 88 kDa protein (CC88) and was determined to associate with the central region of CAN that contains several protein interaction motifs. A second protein of 112 kDa (CC112) was found to interact with the C-terminal nucleoporin-specific repeat of CAN, a region that is supposed to function in nucleocytoplasmic transport. CC112 also interacts with the DEK-CAN and SET-CAN fusion proteins.

The present experiments suggest that p53 is involved in the control of cell ploidity. Using a p53 non-producer cell line, M1/2, that was reconstituted to express either wild type or mutant p53 protein, by infection with the temperature sensitive (Ts) p53Val135 virus, it was found that both loss of wild type p53 or overexpression of mutant p53, may be associated with the generation of cell polyploidity. Overexpression of mutant p53 protein enhanced the appearance of giant cells that further accumulated following gamma-irradiation. Expression of wild type p53 reduced the level of giant cells which accumulated in the parental M1/2 p53 non-producer cells following gamma-irradiation. This activity of the wild type p53 seems to be mediated by either the reduction in the rate of giant cell generation, as observed in M1/2 derived cell lines expressing low levels of wild type p53 protein or by facilitating their apoptosis, as observed in wild type p53 high-producer cells. The latter conclusion is further supported by the observation that isolated giant cells are directly induced to undergo apoptosis following wild type p53 expression.","['Peled, A', 'Schwartz, D', 'Elkind, N B', 'Wolkowicz, R', 'Li, R', 'Rotter, V']","['Peled A', 'Schwartz D', 'Elkind NB', 'Wolkowicz R', 'Li R', 'Rotter V']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Ploidies', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",1996/10/17 00:00,1996/10/17 00:01,['1996/10/17 00:00'],"['1996/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Oct 17;13(8):1677-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model allowed us to create both a normal level of secretory phase P or an inadequate level of secretory phase P, i.e. endometria that cannot support implantation. The objective of our present study focused on PCR analyses of genes for several factors that are believed to be important in the proper maturation of the endometrium. Complementary DNA (cDNA) populations were prepared from endometria harvested on day 13 (peak E level), days 21-23 of an adequate secretory phase (PcDNA) and days 21-23 of an inadequate secretory phase (IcDNA). Although placental protein 14, leukemia inhibitory factor and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase displayed highly upregulated levels in PcDNA (P-activated genes), there was little or no up-regulation in IcDNA. Transforming growth factor-beta 2 and its receptor and insulin growth factor-I and its receptor were up-regulated in PcDNA, whereas little or no expression was observed in IcDNA. Regulators of the cell cycle and transcription, such as retinoblastoma, c-fos, and c-jun genes, were also greatly underexpressed in IcDNA compared with PcDNA. Interestingly, one gene that we studied, keratinocyte growth factor, that was up-regulated by P (peak E levels vs. PcDNA) was more highly expressed in IcDNA. This latter result suggests that low levels of circulating P are sufficient for expression of this gene, whereas high sustained P levels result in an autologous down-regulation. These data show that the regulation of genes that may play pivotal roles in endometrial maturation are differentially expressed in IcDNA vs. PcDNA and may, in part, characterize improper endometrial maturation.","['Okulicz, W C', 'Ace, C I', 'Longcope, C', 'Tast, J']","['Okulicz WC', 'Ace CI', 'Longcope C', 'Tast J']","['Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655, USA.

Some of them are produced by chondrocytes and interact to regulate cartilage metabolism. In this study, we investigated the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by human chondrocytes and examined the modulation of their secretion by exogenous cytokines. Human articular chondrocytes were isolated from their extracellular matrix by a triple successive enzymatic digestion of the cartilage. Subsequently, chondrocytes were stimulated by increased amounts of human recombinant cytokines [IL-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), IL-8, LIF, IL-6]. IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and LIF were assayed into culture media and inside cell extracts by specific enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassays (EASIAs). Under these experimental conditions, we have identified various interactions between cytokines. IL-beta and TNF alpha highly stimulated IL-6, LIF and IL-8 productions. IL-6 decreased IL-8 synthesis and increased LIF production. IL-8 slightly enhanced IL-6 production. Finally, LIF stimulated IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 productions. Using neutralizing antibodies against IL-1, we demonstrated that the effects of LIF were secondary to the stimulation by LIF of IL-1 beta production by the chondrocytes. In conclusion, chondrocytes secrete a variety of immunocompetent cytokines including IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and LIF that can interact to regulate chondrocytes metabolism. These results also define new biological activities of LIF and IL-6, and raise questions concerning their role in the pathogenesis of joint diseases.","['Henrotin, Y E', 'De Groote, D D', 'Labasse, A H', 'Gaspar, S E', 'Zheng, S X', 'Geenen, V G', 'Reginster, J Y']","['Henrotin YE', 'De Groote DD', 'Labasse AH', 'Gaspar SE', 'Zheng SX', 'Geenen VG', 'Reginster JY']","['Cartilage Metabolism Research Unit, University Hospital, Sart-Tilman, CHU, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Cartilage, Articular/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1063-4584(96)80012-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1063-4584(96)80012-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1996 Sep;4(3):163-73. doi: 10.1016/s1063-4584(96)80012-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both CSA and M17 synergized more strongly with FK 506 than they did between themselves. These results show that some metabolites of CSA, like the parent compound, possess anti-allergic effects and that at concentrations that are obtainable in transplant patients, synergistic interaction occurs between CSA and its metabolites, and this may be of some therapeutic significance.","['Ezeamuzie, C I']",['Ezeamuzie CI'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (cyclosporine metabolite M18)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '89270-23-5 (cyclosporine metabolite M21)', '89270-28-0 (cyclosporine metabolite M17)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy', 'Immunoglobulin E/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Rats', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192056196845061 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(96)84506-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1996 Apr;18(4):263-70. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(96)84506-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study introduced the notion that it is possible to develop gene therapies against infectious agents on the basis of mutant host factors required for viral replication. In this report, we provide further evidence to support this new paradigm and describe murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vectors expressing three different eIF-5A mutants from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). HIV-1 replication (SF2, HXB-3) was reduced up to 2 orders of magnitude in transduced, polyclonal T cell populations. All eIF-5A mutants also showed antiviral activity (approximately seven-fold reduction) in a chronic HIV-1 infection model. Expression of eIF-5A mutant M13 delta in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) showed no difference in proliferation and metabolic activity as determined in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-assay, suggesting that expression of this type of mutant protein is not associated with cellular toxicity.

Production of IGFBP-2 in M-9 was approximately 20-fold higher (up to 195 ng ml-1) than in M-3, partially reflecting higher proliferation. However, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that, independent of the culture medium 10(6) T-cells contained between 30 and 48 units IGFBP-2 mRNA relative to the glycerol aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase control gene, but B-cells contained less than 1 unit.

To evaluate the immunoregulatory and antitumor capacities of lung tumor-derived interleukin-7 (IL-7), we transduced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with the IL-7/HyTK internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) retroviral vector and evaluated modifications in tumor phenotype and cocultured effector activities. In vitro proliferation of IL-7-transduced tumor cells was significantly less than control vector-transduced and parental tumor cells. The decreased proliferation rates of IL-7-transduced cells could be reproduced by adding high concentrations of recombinant IL-7 to the parental cells. Anti-IL-7 monoclonal antibody significantly increased the proliferation of the IL-7-transduced cells (P < .05). Parental NSCLC cells were found to express the IL-7 receptor, and IL-7 gene transduction did not alter expression of the IL-7 receptor. IL-7 transduction significantly altered tumor cell expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1, major histocompatibility complex 1, lymphocyte function-related antigen 3, very late activation antigen beta 1, and p185neu. Peripheral blood lymphocytes cocultured with either IL-7-transduced tumor cells or tumor supernatants had enhanced cytolytic and proliferative capacities compared with coculture with control vector-transduced or parental cells. Our findings indicate that IL-7 gene transfer in NSCLC significantly augments cocultured effector activities in vitro, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, and modifies tumor cell surface phenotype. These findings suggest that IL-7 gene therapy may be effective in modifying host antitumor responses in NSCLC.","['Sharma, S', 'Wang, J', 'Huang, M', 'Paul, R W', 'Lee, P', 'McBride, W H', 'Economou, J S', 'Roth, M D', 'Kiertscher, S M', 'Dubinett, S M']","['Sharma S', 'Wang J', 'Huang M', 'Paul RW', 'Lee P', 'McBride WH', 'Economou JS', 'Roth MD', 'Kiertscher SM', 'Dubinett SM']","['Pulmonary Immunology Laboratory, UCLA School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1996 Sep-Oct;3(5):302-13.,,,"['CA 58993-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59326-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07014-18/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome was fatal in six patients; all of whom developed hepatic encephalopathy. In four of these patients, alanine transaminase levels exceeded 1000 iu/l. Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive therapy permit enhanced viral replication.

In Drosophila, chemical mutagenesis screens were complemented with P-element insertional mutagenesis which facilitated the cloning of many genes that had been identified by chemical lesions. To facilitate the cloning of vertebrate genes that are important during embryogenesis, we have developed an insertional mutagenesis strategy in zebrafish using a retroviral vector. Here, in a pilot screen of 217 proviral insertions, we obtained three insertional mutants with embryonic lethal phenotypes, and identified two of the disrupted genes. One of these, no arches, is essential for normal pharyngeal arch development, and is homologous to the recently characterized Drosophila zinc-finger gene, clipper, which encodes a novel type of ribonuclease. As it is easy to generate tens to hundreds of thousands of proviral transgenes in zebrafish, it should now be possible to use this screening method to mutate and then rapidly clone a large number of genes affecting vertebrate developmental and cellular processes.","['Gaiano, N', 'Amsterdam, A', 'Kawakami, K', 'Allende, M', 'Becker, T', 'Hopkins, N']","['Gaiano N', 'Amsterdam A', 'Kawakami K', 'Allende M', 'Becker T', 'Hopkins N']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (cpsf4 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/abnormalities', 'Embryonic Development', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Pharynx/embryology', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics', '*Zebrafish Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1996/10/31 00:00,1996/10/31 00:01,['1996/10/31 00:00'],"['1996/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/383829a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1996 Oct 31;383(6603):829-32. doi: 10.1038/383829a0.,,,,['GENBANK/U70479'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the hypothesis that this capacity stems from down-regulation of PKC activity and/or Ca2+-dependent (group-I; cPKC) isoform expression, comparisons were made between the effects of this agent and the stage-2 tumor promoter mezerein under conditions favoring either cellular differentiation or drug-induced apoptosis. Twenty-four-hour pretreatment of HL-60 cells with 10 nM bryostatin 1, which does not induce differentiation in this cell line, led to a profound reduction in membrane and cytosolic PKC activity, decreased expression of cPKC isoforms (alpha, betaI, betaII, gamma), and a marked increase in ara-C induced apoptosis. In contrast, 10 nM mezerein, which induces HL-60 cell differentiation, was less effective in down-regulating membrane and cytosolic PKC activity as well as alpha, betaI, and gamma cPKC isoform expression, and failed to potentiate ara-C-related apoptosis. The effects of bryostatin 1 were dominant to those of mezerein, in that the combination resulted in down-regulation of PKC activity and expression and potentiation of ara-C-induced apoptosis, but not cellular maturation. However, coadministration of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (250 nM) restored bryostatin 1's differentiating ability while antagonizing its capacity to augment apoptosis, despite failing to reverse bryostatin 1-induced down-regulation of PKC activity and cPKC isoform expression. Furthermore, pretreatment of differentiation-responsive monocytic leukemia cells (U937) with bryostatin 1 substantially reduced PKC activity and cPKC isoform expression, but exerted minimal effects on ara-C-related apoptosis. In contrast, exposure of U937 cells to bryostatin 1 after ara-C dramatically increased apoptosis, a phenomenon that did not occur in differentiation-unresponsive HL-60 cells. Collectively, these observations indicate that down-regulation of total assayable PKC activity and cPKC expression by bryostatin 1 are insufficient, by themselves, to account for potentiation of leukemic cell apoptosis, at least under conditions in which differentiation occurs. They also provide further evidence that a reciprocal and highly schedule-dependent relationship exists between leukemic cell differentiation and drug-induced apoptosis.","['Grant, S', 'Turner, A J', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Wang, Z', 'Kramer, L', 'Jarvis, W D']","['Grant S', 'Turner AJ', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Wang Z', 'Kramer L', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Diterpenes', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/10 00:00,1996/10/10 00:01,['1996/10/10 00:00'],"['1996/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90300-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0300 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Oct 10;228(1):65-75. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0300.,,,"['R01 CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA66990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are widespread as both endogenous and exogenous agents within vertebrates and have been associated with a variety of malignancies and other disorders. We isolated and characterized 12 endogenous representatives of this genus from a number of mammalian hosts. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that the isolated viruses cluster into two clearly distinct groups. All of the exogenous MuLV-related retroviruses which have been isolated to date, as well as several endogenous examples, fall into the first group, whereas the second group is represented solely by endogenous representatives, including human endogenous retrovirus type E (HERV.E). The two groups are widespread within mammals, with both often present within one animal species. Despite this, there is no evidence to date that recombination between members of the different groups has occurred. Genetic distances and several other properties of the HERV.E genome suggest that if exogenous members of this subgroup exist, they are likely to have biological properties different from those of the other exogenous viruses of this genus. Several of these viruses are known to have been integrated within their hosts' genomes for a long period of time, and a most recent divergence date for the MuLV and HERV.E subgroups can thus be proposed. This date, approximately 30 million years ago, is the most recent date possible, and it is probable that the actual period of time since their divergence is significantly longer.","['Tristem, M', 'Kabat, P', 'Lieberman, L', 'Linde, S', 'Karpas, A', 'Hill, F']","['Tristem M', 'Kabat P', 'Lieberman L', 'Linde S', 'Karpas A', 'Hill F']","['Department of Biology, Imperial College, Ascot, Berkshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*classification/*genetics', 'Mammals/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.8241-8246.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):8241-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.8241-8246.1996.,PMC190910,,,"['GENBANK/X99924', 'GENBANK/X99925', 'GENBANK/X99926', 'GENBANK/X99927', 'GENBANK/X99928', 'GENBANK/X99929', 'GENBANK/X99930', 'GENBANK/X99931', 'GENBANK/X99932', 'GENBANK/X99933', 'GENBANK/X99934', 'GENBANK/X99935']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results show that the transforming potential of the axl gene can be activated by truncation of the extracellular domain of the receptor and fusion of the remaining sequence to the gag gene.","['Zhang, Q K', 'Boast, S', 'de los Santos, K', 'Begemann, M', 'Goff, S P']","['Zhang QK', 'Boast S', 'de los Santos K', 'Begemann M', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.8089-8097.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):8089-97. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.8089-8097.1996.,PMC190883,,['P01 CA23767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While FeLV recombinants that encode cellular sequences have been isolated from tumors of naturally infected animals, the acquisition of an unrelated host gene has never been documented in an experimental FeLV infection. We isolated recombinant FeLV proviruses encoding feline Notch2 sequences from thymic lymphoma DNA of two cats inoculated with the molecularly cloned virus FeLV-61E. Four recombinant genomes were identified, three in one cat and one in the other. Each had similar but distinct transduction junctions, and in all cases, the insertions replaced most of the envelope gene with a region of Notch2 that included the intracellular ankyrin repeat functional domain. The product of the FeLV/Notch2 recombinant provirus was a novel, truncated 65- to 70-kD Notch2 protein that was targeted to the cell nucleus. This virally encoded Notch2 protein, which resembles previously constructed, constitutively activated forms of Notch, was apparently expressed from a subgenomic transcript spliced at the normal envelope donor and acceptor sequences.

Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with FBL-3 readily elicits CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) capable of lysing FBL-3 as well as syngeneic leukemias induced by Moloney and Rauscher MuLV. The aim of this current study was to identify the immunogenic epitope(s) recognized by the FBL-3-specific CD8+ CTL. A series of FBL-3-specific CD8+ CTL clones were generated from C57BL/6 mice immunized to FBL-3. The majority of CTL clones (32 of 38) were specific for F-MuLV gag-encoded antigen. By using a series of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing full-length and truncated F-MuLV gag genes, the antigenic epitope recognized by the FBL-3 gag-specific CTL clones, as well as by bulk-cultured CTL from spleens of mice immune to FBL-3, was localized to the leader sequence of gPr80gag protein. The precise amino acid sequence of the CTL epitope in the leader sequence was identified as CCLCLTVFL (positions 85-93) by examining lysis of targets incubated with a series of synthetic leader sequence peptides. No evidence of other CTL epitopes in the gPr80gag or Pr65gag core virion structural polyproteins was found. The identity of CCLCLTVFL as the target peptide was validated by showing that immunization with the peptide elicited CTL that lysed FBL-3. The CTL elicited by the Gag peptide also specifically lysed syngeneic leukemia cells induced by Moloney and Rauscher MuLV (MBL-2 and RBL-5). The transmembrane peptide was shown to be the major gag-encoded antigenic epitope recognized by bulk-cultured CTL derived from C57BL/6 mice immunized to MBL-2 or RBL-5. Thus, the CTL epitope of FBL-3 is localized to the transmembrane anchor domain of the nonstructural Gag polyprotein and is shared by leukemia/lymphoma cell lines induced by Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher MuLV.","['Chen, W', 'Qin, H', 'Chesebro, B', 'Cheever, M A']","['Chen W', 'Qin H', 'Chesebro B', 'Cheever MA']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA. wchen@cesmtp.ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*immunology', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.7773-7782.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):7773-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.7773-7782.1996.,PMC190847,,"['CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These fragments were isolated from a synthetic combinatorial library of human Fab antibody fragments displayed on the surface of filamentous phage. The antibody fragments were selected by using recombinant heterodimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT purified from insect cells as a solid-phase selector. This procedure led to the isolation of two antibody fragments that completely neutralize the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of RT at nanomolar concentrations. Both antibody fragments bind only to the enzymatically active form of the RT. The inhibitory activity of the anti-RT antibody fragments is competitive with respect to the template primer. The antibody fragments also neutralize the activities of RTs from avian and murine retroviruses and of DNA polymerases of prokaryotic origin as well as human DNA polymerase alpha. Thus, the antibody fragments selected and characterized in this study appear to recognize a structural fold that is common to the different DNA polymerases and necessary for their activity. The results provide an immunological experimental basis for a purely structural and evolutionary classification of the polymerase family.","['Gargano, N', 'Biocca, S', 'Bradbury, A', 'Cattaneo, A']","['Gargano N', 'Biocca S', 'Bradbury A', 'Cattaneo A']","['International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Coliphages', 'Gene Library', 'HIV Antibodies/*immunology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/classification/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Spodoptera/cytology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.7706-7712.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):7706-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.7706-7712.1996.,PMC190840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared T-cell competence in serologically positive alymphocytotic (AL) animals with T-cell functions in animals with progressive stages of infection, PL and tumor bearing (TB). Dramatic differences were observed in lymphocyte proliferation to recombinant proteins encoded by BLV gag (p12, p15, and p24) and env (gp30, and gp51) genes in different disease stages. Lymphocytes from AL cattle recognized an average of three of five recombinant proteins per animal. Expansion of antigen pulsed lymphocytes in interleukin-2 increased protein recognition to almost five per animal. In contrast, lymphocytes from PL and TB animals failed to recognize any BLV recombinant proteins. Short-term T-cell cultures from the PL group expanded in interleukin-2, as well as the PL and TB cells cultured in indomethacin (3 to 6 microg/ml), increased the average of recognized proteins per animal to one. Cells proliferating to BLV antigens were CD4+ T lymphocytes, as shown by cell depletion studies. The positive effect of indomethacin suggests involvement of prostaglandin E2 as a negative regulatory factor in the later stages of disease. Thus, for the first time, advancing stages of BLV infection were correlated with decreased T-cell competence, providing deeper insight into pathogenesis of retroviral infections.","['Orlik, O', 'Splitter, G A']","['Orlik O', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.7584-7593.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):7584-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.7584-7593.1996.,PMC190827,,['R01.CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate Tax-mediated transcription in vivo, we expressed Tax as well as CREB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The activity of these proteins was monitored by expression of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene, which was fused to two viral 21-bp repeats located upstream of the yeast cytochrome c1 oxidase minimal promoter. Coexpression of Tax and CREB in S. cerevisiae led to a 20-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity in comparison with that in strains expressing either Tax or CREB alone. By screening a human cDNA library, we were able to demonstrate that the Tax transactivation assay using S. cerevisiae can be successfully applied to identify other cellular proteins forming ternary complexes with Tax and 21-bp repeats in vivo. Upon transformation in S. cerevisiae, 1 of 13,500 clones tested positive. Sequencing of the cDNA insert of the rescued plasmid revealed that this DNA encoded the ATF-1 protein. beta-Galactosidase induction was comparable to that of the Tax/CREB coexpression system. This indicates that Tax-mediated transcription is critically dependent on the presence of cellular CREB or ATF-1 in vivo. Stimulation of transcription initiation required an unmasked NH2 terminus of Tax. Fusion of Tax to the yeast Gal4 protein abolished the transactivation potential of Tax. Reconstitution of the transcriptional properties of viral Tax together with the cellular proteins of the ATF-1/CREB family in S. cerevisiae allows the functional characterization of these proteins in vivo.","['Shnyreva, M', 'Munder, T']","['Shnyreva M', 'Munder T']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Hans-Knoll-Institut fur Naturstoff-Forschung e.V., Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.11.7478-7484.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Nov;70(11):7478-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.11.7478-7484.1996.,PMC190815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well-known that leukemia occurs in approximately 10% of cases, with increasing risk with age. Less commonly recognized is the risk for myelodysplastic syndromes (approximately 5%); the relationship between myelodysplasia and evolution to leukemia remains speculative. What also needs to be emphasized is that older patients have an ever-increasing risk for development of solid tumors, with at least 5% reported to have liver tumors (male:female ratio, 2:1) and an equal number of other cancers (female:male ratio, 3:1, even after exclusion of gynecologic malignancies). Hematologists have tended to focus on aplastic anemia and leukemia. As FA patients live longer, more of the other malignancies will occur, perhaps related to cord blood or bone marrow transplant, or treatment with cytokines.

The J-C(lambda)1, J-C(lambda)2, J-C(lambda)3, and J-C(lambda)7 are functional gene regions and encode for the four Ig(lambda) isotypes, whereas J-C(lambda)4, J-C(lambda)5, and J-C(lambda)6 are non-functional (pseudo) Ig(lambda) gene regions. Recently, we demonstrated that Southern blot analysis with the IGLC3 probe in combined EcoRI/HindIII digests allows detection of approximately 95% of all clonal Ig(lambda) gene rearrangements in B cell malignancies. Although this single probe/enzyme combination is quite effective in detecting Ig(lambda) gene rearrangements, it should be noted that it results in a complex pattern of multiple germline bands of different density, which needs experience for correct interpretation. To improve further the reliable detection and identification of clonal Ig(lambda) gene rearrangements, we developed a new set of seven 'isotype-specific' DNA probes: the IGLC1D probe for the J-C(lambda)1 gene region, the IGLC2D probe for the J-C(lambda)2 gene region, the IGLJ2 probe for the highly homologous J-C(lambda)2 and J-C(lambda)3 gene regions, and the IGLC4D, IGLJ5, IGLJ6, and IGLJ7 probes for the last four J-C(lambda) gene regions, respectively. In combination with optimally chosen digests (ie HindIII, BglII, BamHI, and/or EcoRI) the seven probes indeed allow easy detection and identification of all rearrangements in the seven J-C(lambda) gene regions. The applicability of the probe/enzyme combinations was confirmed upon analysis of clonal 'Ig(lambda)-isotype' gene rearrangements in 40 B lineage malignancies.","['Tumkaya, T', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Tumkaya T', 'Beishuizen A', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Technical Report'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern/*methods', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1834-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available data suggest an alternative classification and model that initially divides AML into two groups not recognized by traditional classification: MDS-related (MDR)-AML and true de novo (TDN)-AML. MDR-AML includes most AML in the elderly, AML following MDS, AML complicating Fanconi's anemia, and a minor subset of AML in children; these subgroups appear to be linked by a common mutator phenotype, common genetic abnormalities, multilineage hematopoietic dysplasia, clonal hematopoiesis, and poor outcome with cytotoxic chemotherapy. TDN-AML includes AML with the common translocations seen in children and young adults; these subgroups lack features of a mutator phenotype, have approximately flat incidence throughout life, have similar genetic abnormalities, lack multilineage hematopoietic dysplasia and clonal hematopoiesis, and often have good outcome with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Progression in TDN-AML appears to consist predominantly of expansion of a transformed clone, while progression in MDR disease appears to consist initially of progressive accumulation of genetic damage, eventuating in malignant transformation to MDR-AML in some cases. This revised model and classification create therapeutically significant disease groups, allow rapprochement of clinical, morphologic, genetic, and biologic findings in AML, provide a rational model for AML, and frame questions that provide logical direction for future diagnostic, therapeutic, and biologic studies in AML.","['Head, D R']",['Head DR'],"[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, College of Medicine, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1826-31.,,,"['CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enrichment of colony-forming cells was higher in biotin-KL+ than ACK-2+ fractions. Colony-forming cells were not found in the Kit- subsets. To study the hemopoietic repopulation capacity of the Kit+ and Kit- cells, serial dilutions of the sorted fractions were transplanted into irradiated mice, and peripheral blood of these recipients was monitored regularly for the presence of donor-derived cells during a 1 year period. Nucleated blood cell repopulation by male donor cells in female recipients was assessed using a Y-chromosome specific DNA probe; erythroid repopulation by normal donor cells in W/Wv recipients was examined flow cytometrically by measuring the forward light scatter of donor- and host-type erythrocytes. A 25- to 100-fold enrichment of long-term repopulating ability in the sorted Kit+ fractions showed that Kit+ cells are capable of reconstitution of circulating erythrocytes and nucleated blood cells after BM transplantation. Transient repopulation of the red blood cell lineage was observed after transplantation of Kit- cells. Detection of donor-derived nucleated cells 1 year after transplantation showed that Kit+ cells contributed to donor-type repopulation of bone marrow, spleen and thymus.

Maximal apoptosis (44.12%) was observed at day 5 in cells from patients with poor prognosis. The addition of gamma-IFN to the culture media prevented apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition of apoptosis was achieved with 100 IU/ml of gamma-IFN. The degree of inhibition of apoptosis by gamma-IFN was greater in cells from the high-risk group patients than in those from the intermediate and good prognosis group (P < 0.0001). The expression of gamma-IFN receptors in B-CLL cells was evaluated using a MnAb against the extracellular domain of gamma-IFN receptor.

However gamma-IFN was detectable in the media from both normal B cells and B-CLL cells in culture; there was no difference in the amount of gamma-IFN released by cells from the three groups of patients studied. Our results show that in vivo gamma-IFN inhibits apoptosis of B cells from B-CLL patients. The inhibitory effect of gamma-IFN on apoptosis correlates directly with the severity of the disease and this is likely explained by a marked upregulation of gamma-IFN receptors in cells from patients in the high-risk group.","['Rojas, R', 'Roman, J', 'Torres, A', 'Ramirez, R', 'Carracedo, J', 'Lopez, R', 'Garcia, J M', 'Martin, C', 'Pintado, O']","['Rojas R', 'Roman J', 'Torres A', 'Ramirez R', 'Carracedo J', 'Lopez R', 'Garcia JM', 'Martin C', 'Pintado O']","['Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1782-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have identified significant, albeit variable, increases in these diseases of the frequency of both light density and CD34+ cells expressing two particular CD44 epitopes, neither of which is commonly found on normal human marrow cells. One of these epitopes is unique to exon v10-containing isoforms of CD44. The other is located in the common region of CD44 and was previously revealed on T cells only after their activation. Interestingly, another T cell activation-associated epitope was found to be expressed on a high proportion of normal marrow cells including the CD34+ subset and this remained the case for most of the primary leukemic samples evaluated. As expected, >90% of cells in all primary normal and leukemic samples expressed high levels of CD44, as shown by their reactivity with an antibody specific for the CD44 hyaluronan-binding site. To begin investigating how expression of the CD44 epitopes seen more commonly on leukemic than on normal CD34+ cells may be modulated, and to identify potentially associated effects on the hyaluronan-binding ability of the CD44 expressed, the effect of phorbol ester treatment on these properties of CD44 were examined. For these studies, a panel of five different human leukemic cell lines that were found to exhibit different patterns of CD44 expression and function in the absence of phorbol ester were used. Both the level and the hyaluronan-binding properties of CD44 could be stimulated in some, but not all, of these leukemic cell lines. Taken together, our findings indicate that CD44 expression is perturbed in a variety of leukemic populations suggesting a possible relationship to some of the pathogenetic features they share.","['Ghaffari, S', 'Dougherty, G J', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Ghaffari S', 'Dougherty GJ', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1773-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting bispecific antibody contains two different specificities within a single antibody molecule. One binding site (CD3) activates the T cells via the T cell receptor complex, whereas the second binding site (CD19) targets the cytolytic T cells to malignant B cells. Leukemic blasts from children with B-lineage ALL showed stable and strong CD19 expression. CD3xCD19 bsAb were used to activate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors or from patients with ALL during remission. Cytotoxic activity against autologous ALL cells by PBMC was induced upon addition of 100 ng/ml CD3xCD19 bsAb after 3 days of preincubation. Costimulation through CD28 increased T cell proliferation to some extent, but did not increase cytotoxic activity of PBMC against leukemic blasts. We present evidence for an effective and specific activation of resting human T lymphocytes by CD3xCD19 bsAb in vitro. Activation of cytotoxic effector T cells is feasible by preincubation with bsAb CD3xCD19 alone and does not rely on additional external costimulation.

We used cryopreserved leukemia cells of 18 patients with acute myelogenous (n= 14) or lymphocytic (n= 4) leukemia to investigate the effect of IL-12, alone or in combination with IL-2, on the cytolytic activity of NK cells against human leukemia targets. Effector cells were peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors which were depleted from CD3+ T cells by immunomagnetic separation. CD3-negative effector cells (mainly CD56+ NK cells) were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of IL-2 (100 U/ml to 1000 U/ml) and IL-12 (1 U/ml to 100 U/ml). Cytotoxicity was measured in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay. Whereas a two-fold enhancement of cytotoxic activity was observed after incubation with optimal doses of IL-2 or IL-12, the combination of both cytokines (500 U/ml IL-2, 100 U/ml IL-12) increased the lytic activity more than six-fold. This effect was accompanied by increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CD2, CD18) and CD25 on CD56+ effector cells. Of 18 leukemias investigated, five were completely resistant to lysis by effector cells activated with IL-2 or IL-12 alone. In three of these five cases, however, high cytolytic activity was observed after coincubation with IL-2 and IL-12. In comparison to allogeneic NK cells, autologous cells of three patients in remission demonstrated significantly lower cytotoxic activity. No killing of nonmalignant cells (PHA blasts) by allogeneic NK cells was observed. Our data demonstrate that IL-12 can enhance or even induce MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated allogeneic natural killer cells. Since IL-12 has also been shown to have stem-cell mobilizing capacities, it could be used for the recruitment of both stem cells and antileukemic effector cells in the context of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.","['Uharek, L', 'Zeis, M', 'Glass, B', 'Steinmann, J', 'Dreger, P', 'Gassmann, W', 'Schmitz, N', 'Muller-Ruchholtz, W']","['Uharek L', 'Zeis M', 'Glass B', 'Steinmann J', 'Dreger P', 'Gassmann W', 'Schmitz N', 'Muller-Ruchholtz W']","['Department of Internal Medicine II and Institute for Immunology, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1758-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the effect of a novel vitamin D3 analog, EB1089, on normal myeloid and leukemic cells as well as CD34+ cells. EB1089 showed an extraordinary inhibition of clonal growth of HL-60 cells (ED50 = 5 x 10(-11) M) and AML blast cells (ED50 = 9 x 10(-10) M) compared to 1,25(OH)2D3 without suppression of growth of normal human bone marrow CFU-GM.

In contrast, both EB1089 and 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-8) M) showed little or only mild inhibition of CD34+ clongenic hematopoietic cells from normal human peripheral blood (PB); and in liquid culture, EB1089 stimulated the proliferation of normal human CD34+ cells about 2.5 times as compared to control cultures. In order to evaluate the potential use of EB1089 for purging leukemic cells from normal CD34+ progenitor cells for PB stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), normal human PB mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were contaminated with HL-60 cells, and then CD34+ cells purified and treated with EB1089. We found that CD34+ purification and EB1089 purging was able to eliminate approximately 100% of HL-60 leukemic cells with no toxicity to normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.

We performed a dose escalation study of SDZ PSC 833 combined with VAD chemotherapy in refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Twenty-two MM patients who were refractory to doxorubicin/vincristine/dexamethasone (VADr, n=11) or had failed multiple regimens (n=6) or were melphalan-refractory (MELr, n=5), were treated with one to three cycles of VAD combined with oral SDZ PSC 833, which was administered at escalating dosages starting at 5 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day for 7 days. The median trough and peak blood levels of SDZ PSC 833 ranged from 461/1134 ng/ml at 5 mg/kg/day to 821/2663 ng/ml at 15 mg/kg, respectively. With addition of SDZ PSC 833 (5 mg/kg) the mean plasma AUC 0-->96 h of doxorubicin as compared with control patients treated with VAD increased from 779 to 1510 ng/ml/h (P=0.0071), while the doxorubicin clearance was reduced from 47.6 to 27.8 l/h/m2 (P=0.0002). The clearance of doxorubicinol was reduced accordingly. Because of the increased plasma AUC, the dose of doxorubicin and vincristine had to be reduced in 13 patients to 50% (n=1) or 75% (n=12). A further dose-escalation of SDZ PSC 833 did not lead to a proportional increase of doxorubicin AUC. Toxicity WHO CTC grade 2 or 3 included hypoplasia (18/22), constipation (10/22), hyponatremia (3/22) and infections (6/22). A partial response or stable disease was achieved in eight and six patients, respectively. In 17 evaluable patients the mean percentage of pretreatment bone marrow plasma cells which expressed P-glycoprotein was 40%. The pretreatment in vitro rhodamin retention in CD38++ myeloma cells was reversible by 2 microM SDZ PSC 833 with 15-98% in 7/9 tested patients. In 4/5 responding patients analyzed before and after treatment with VAD + SDZ PSC 833, a reduction of P-gp + plasma cells was observed. It is concluded, that the blood concentrations of SDZ PSC 833 attained in MM patients increase with dose after oral administration. It can be safely combined with VAD chemotherapy. SDZ PSC 833 diminishes the clearance of doxorubicin, leading to an increase of the plasma AUC of doxorubicin. In addition, it is an effective inhibitor of P-gp mediated efflux of doxorubicin in myeloma tumor cells in vitro. Therefore, a proportional dose-reduction of doxorubicin and vincristine is warranted.

The introduction of BCR/abl into BaF3 cells, an IL-3-dependent pro-lymphocytic cell line, abrogates the requirement of IL-3 for growth. Given that IL-3 leads to the phosphorylation of Stat proteins, we tested the hypothesis that BCR/abl transformation of hematopoietic cells induces the phosphorylation of Stats. We found that BaF3 cells transformed by either the p190 or p210 forms of BCR/abl possess constitutively phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat5. Phosphorylation of Stat proteins was greater in cells transformed by p190 BCR/abl than in cells transformed by p210 BCR/abl, suggesting that the magnitude of phosphorylation of Stat proteins may play a role in the biological effects of BCR/abl. Expression of BCR/abl containing a mutation (Y177F) that prevents its interaction with GRB2 led to a decrease in the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat5. This suggested that GRB2, or its binding site on BCR/abl, may participate in the phosphorylation of Stat proteins. We also observed that the anti-phospho-Stat antibody directly recognized both the p190 and p210 forms of BCR/abl. This indicated that a tyrosine residue that becomes phosphorylated in BCR/abl may share homology with the tyrosine phosphorylation site of Stat1 and Stat5.

Nine multiple myelomas, 17 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 18 acute lymphocytic leukemias, 37 chronic lymphocytic leukemias and 33 non-neoplastic controls were studied. To screen the entire RAG-1 gene we used primers overlapping genomic segments of the RAG-1 coding sequence (nucleotides 87 to 3311). Samples with an abnormal band pattern in the SSCP were cloned and sequenced. Successful amplification was achieved with our protocol. The multiple PCR-SSCP analysis proved to be a feasible and sensitive strategy for studying variations in the sequence of the RAG-1 gene. No mutations other than the three previously reported sequence variations were detected. Although mutations in this gene do not appear to be common in lymphoid neoplasias, it would be interesting to ascertain whether the different variant forms of RAG-1 protein have an abnormal recombinase activity.","['Nomdedeu, J', 'Lasa, A', 'Seminago, R', 'Mateu, R', 'Rubiol, E', 'Baiget, M', 'Soler, J']","['Nomdedeu J', 'Lasa A', 'Seminago R', 'Mateu R', 'Rubiol E', 'Baiget M', 'Soler J']","[""Departament d'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Genes, RAG-1', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1715-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We adjusted for these variables and differences in time-to-treatment in subsequent comparisons of treatment-related mortality, relapse, survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS). Five-year probability of treatment-related mortality was greater for transplants than chemotherapy (43% (95% confidence interval, 37-49%) vs 7% (3-11%); P< 0.0001).

A report of 40 children of the AML-BFM Study Group.,1677-86,"Forty children with Down's syndrome have been identified among 633 patients in the cooperative pediatric BFM studies for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) since 1987. The following features were characteristic for these patients: (1) a 500-fold higher than expected incidence of megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) with a peak incidence under 4 years of age; (2) a myelodysplastic prephase with thrombocytopenia lasting for several months up to a few years; (3) frequent involvement of the red cell lineage as suggested by dyserythropoiesis in the bone marrow; (4) coexpression of the lymphoid cell surface antigen CD7 on the leukemic blasts; (5) absence of the translocation t(1;22), instead presence of complete or partial trisomies involving chromosomes 8 and 1; and (6) a good response to chemotherapy. Nearly half of the patients did not receive any or only palliative chemotherapy and subsequently died. In 21 patients treatment according to the AML-BFM protocols was intended, however, with major dose or protocol reductions in six patients. Four died early, 15 (71%) achieved remission. Nine of 11 patients remaining alive for 0.6-6.5 years had received intensive treatment including high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-Ara-C). The 5-year survival estimate of 48% +/- 12% was similar to patients without Down's syndrome. In conclusion, these clinical and biological features suggest that M7 leukemia in children with Down's syndrome (M7-Down) is distinct from megakaryoblastic leukemia in other children. Children with Down's syndrome show a favorable outcome if treated adequately. However, overtreatment should be avoided and life-threatening infections pose a particular problem. Therefore, standard-risk AML therapy (including HD-Ara-C) should be considered in children with Down's syndrome and AML.","['Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Vormoor, J', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Reinisch, I', 'Stollmann-Gibbels, B', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Harbott, J']","['Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Vormoor J', 'Ludwig WD', 'Niemeyer C', 'Reinisch I', 'Stollmann-Gibbels B', 'Zimmermann M', 'Harbott J']","[""University-Children's Hospital Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD7/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Down Syndrome', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', '*Neural Tube Defects/etiology/genetics/physiopathology/therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Nov;10(11):1677-86.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1594-5.

ISG15 is secreted from monocytes and lymphocytes, and in this study we have characterized in vitro and in vivo production of ISG15 in response to IFN-alphabeta. Low levels of ISG15 were present constitutively in PBMCs; dose-dependent ISG15 synthesis was observed in response to IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma. High m.w. conjugates, present in PBMC extracts constitutively, were enhanced after IFN-alpha or IFN-beta treatment. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that IFN-beta-induced ISG15 was released from primary cultures of peripheral blood CD3+ (including both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations). Furthermore, ISG15 was released from viable cell lines of monocyte, T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and epithelial origins. Since ISG15 was secreted in response to IFN treatment in vitro, its levels in the serum of healthy human volunteers treated with IFN-beta(ser) were quantitated by asymmetric sandwich ELISA. Both single and multiple doses of IFN-beta(ser) increased serum ISG15 levels significantly (p < 0.01) over baseline. A maximum 7.3-fold enhancement of serum ISG15 was obtained after multiple injections of 8 million units of IFN-beta(ser). Significant change was observed at 24 and 48 h of multiple 0.02-million-unit injections, yielding 1.2- and 1.7-fold increases over basal levels, respectively.

TGF-beta was produced and released constitutively in all three cell lines. When, however, the cell lines were stimulated with Ag, LPS, or calcium ionophore plus PMA, acceleration of release and some additional production of TGF-beta were apparent. In contrast, TNF-alpha was produced and released only when these lines were stimulated. Although neither the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, nor the protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro31-7549, suppressed constitutive production or release of TGF-beta, these agents inhibited TNF-alpha production and the inducible component of TGF-beta production noted above. The release of these cytokines, whether constitutive or inducible, was dependent on Golgi-processing as indicated by inhibition with brefeldin A. Therefore, although both types of cytokines were processed by Golgi, only TNF-alpha and the inducible component of TGF-beta production were protein kinase C or steroid-regulated processes. These findings suggested that constitutive and inducible pathways exist for production and release of cytokines and that the inducible pathways can be selectively suppressed by pharmacologic agents.","['Baumgartner, R A', 'Deramo, V A', 'Beaven, M A']","['Baumgartner RA', 'Deramo VA', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'Y6197FQK8I (Ro 31-7549)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Nov 1;157(9):4087-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of mAbs has been raised against dying cells in the present study by immunizing mice with apoptotic Jurkat cells. One of these Abs, anti-7A6, was found to react with apoptotic cells. Using ELISA or flow cytometry, little reactivity of anti-7A6 was observed in normal or digitonin-permeabilized human peripheral blood lymphocytes and a number of hemopoietic cell lines tested. The Ab, however, strongly reacted with these cells when they were induced to undergo apoptosis by irradiation or treatment with apoptosis-inducing agents. Cell sorting and DNA fragmentation experiments revealed that 7A6-positive cells, but not 7A6-negative cells, had apparent DNA fragments characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. By immunoblot, under reducing conditions, anti-7A6 detected a 38-kDa protein band in the cell lysates prepared from apoptotic cells. Immunoelectron microscopy showed the 7A6 Ag to be localized to the membrane of mitochondria in apoptotic Jurkat cells. These results indicate that anti-7A6 defines a novel epitope on the mitochondrial membrane protein that appears to be exposed on cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that the 7A6 molecule may be involved in the molecular cascade of apoptotic cell death.","['Zhang, C', 'Ao, Z', 'Seth, A', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Zhang C', 'Ao Z', 'Seth A', 'Schlossman SF']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (antigen 7A6)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Intracellular Membranes/*chemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Nov 1;157(9):3980-7.,,,['AI 12069/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, a set of complementary SEA class II-binding mutants was used to study the interaction of SEA with cell surface MHC class II. The results indicate that both class II binding sites are required on the same toxin molecule for maximal activity, demonstrating that simultaneous ligation of two MHC class II molecules on APCs by a single SEA is essential for effective superantigen function.

To determine the relationship between ICE and its substrate IL-1beta, we examined six human cell lines for susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis and Fas induction of ICE-like activity. The human B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 and the human T lymphoma cell lines Jurkat, CEM-6, H-9, and MOLT4 were susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. ICE mRNA was highly expressed in SKW6.4, H-9, and HL-60 cells, and ICE-like activity increased during Fas-mediated apoptosis in SKW6.4 cells. In contrast, IL-1beta mRNA was highly expressed only in HL-60 cells. Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, a tetrapeptidyl inhibitor of ICE, prevented Fas-mediated apoptosis strongly in SKW6.4 and H-9 cells but weakly or marginally in other cells. To examine whether intracellular IL-1beta is a proteolytic substrate or an endogenous competitive inhibitor against other substrates for Fas-ICE-mediated apoptosis in SKW6.4 cells, we established precursor IL-1beta transfectant clones using SKW6.4 cells. We demonstrated that stably transfected SKW6.4 cells expressing precursor IL-1beta, but not cells transfected with the empty vector, exhibited resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis due to competitive inhibition of ICE-like activity, which was associated with increased cleavage of precursor IL-1beta to mature IL-1beta. These results suggest that Fas-mediated apoptosis is mediated by ICE cleavage of proteolytic substrates other than IL-1beta and that IL-1beta is an endogenous inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis.","['Tatsuta, T', 'Cheng, J', 'Mountz, J D']","['Tatsuta T', 'Cheng J', 'Mountz JD']","['Sankyo Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (N-acetyl-tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl chloromethyl ketone)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/*physiology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Nov 1;157(9):3949-57.,,,"['P01 AR03555/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR42547/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI34568/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2-dependent clones established from the DN alphabeta T cell population in the PEC of IL-2 receptor alpha-chain transgenic B6 mice exhibited potent cytotoxicity against a series of B cell lineage leukemias and myelomas, such as CD5+BCL1 and MOPC, without affecting NK-susceptible targets. The cytotoxicity of the clones against BCL1 and MOPC was specifically inhibited by anti-CD3, anti-alphabetaTCR, or anti-relevant Vbeta (Vbeta8) Ab, but not by control Abs, indicating that it was mediated by the specific alphabetaTCR/CD3. Other BALB/c-derived target cells expressing both MHC class I and class II were not affected, and neither Ab against them affected the cytotoxicity, strongly suggesting that the cytotoxicity of NK1+ DN alphabeta T cell clones was independent of the particular MHC Ags. The clones produced IFN-gamma, but little IL-2 or IL-4, in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, to the susceptible, but not resistant, targets, and to IL-12. The clones exhibited TCRalpha (Valpha8) distinct from an invariant TCRalpha (Valpha14) reported to dominate in thymic NK1+ alphabeta T cells. The presence of DN alphabeta T cells with similar functional features in the normal PEC was confirmed by the short term stimulation in vitro. The present results along with other recent reports strongly suggested that, like the mainstream alphabeta T cells, the NK1+ DN alphabeta T cell population consisted of functionally heterogeneous subsets.","['Sugie, T', 'Kubota, H', 'Sato, M', 'Nakamura, E', 'Imamura, M', 'Minato, N']","['Sugie T', 'Kubota H', 'Sato M', 'Nakamura E', 'Imamura M', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Nov 1;157(9):3925-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that pp56(lck) acts on these processes by phosphorylating substrates. However, it has been recently reported that the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function. In this report we address the contribution of the regulatory and catalytic domains of pp56(lck) to another function of this enzyme independent of CD4: TCR-induced IL-2 production. Two pp56(lck) mutants lacking either the entire catalytic domain or the entire NH2 regulatory domain were generated, and their abilities to trigger transactivation of the TCR-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) region of the IL-2 promoter were compared. Only the catalytic, but not the NH2 regulatory, domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce NF-AT region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response. Moreover, the catalytic domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce IL-2 cytokine production to an extent similar to that of wild-type pp56(lck). We conclude that different domains of the pp56(lck) molecule contribute to regulate distinct biologic functions. In fact, while the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function, we show here that the catalytic domain of pp56(lck) is sufficient for induction of IL-2 production, mimicking TCR ligation.","['Carrera, A C', 'Calvo, V', 'Borlado, L R', 'Paradis, H', 'Alemany, S', 'Roberts, T M', 'Martinez-A, C']","['Carrera AC', 'Calvo V', 'Borlado LR', 'Paradis H', 'Alemany S', 'Roberts TM', 'Martinez-A C']","['National Center of Biotechnology, Autonoma University, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/chemistry/*physiology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Nov 1;157(9):3775-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two tyrosines (Y113 and Y128) fall within an identical five amino-acid motif and are shown to be phosphorylated upon TCR ligation. Although mutation of either Y113 and Y128 has a minimal effect on SLP-76 function, mutation of both residues decreases significantly the ability of SLP-76 to promote T cell activation.

After exposure to ionizing radiation, cells from patients with AT demonstrate an attenuated G1-phase checkpoint. Because c-jun is known to regulate, in part, the exit from G1 and the onset of DNA replication, we analyzed c-jun transcription in irradiated AT fibroblasts. METHODS AND MATERIALS: AT5BI fibroblasts were irradiated and RNA was extracted and assayed for c-jun expression by Northern blot analysis. Transcriptional regulation of c-jun was evaluated by use of the 5' untranslated region of the jun promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. Deletion mutants of the RSRF, SP-1, AP-1 and CCAAT domains within the jun promoter linked to the CAT reporter were transfected into AT5BI cells. Transfectants were irradiated, and CAT expression was quantified. After x-irradiation, nuclear protein binding to CCAAT was evaluated by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: X-ray-mediated c-jun expression was sustained in AT5BI cells as compared to only transient expression in irradiated normal diploid fibroblasts. Mutation of either the AP-1 or CCAAT domains within the c-jun promoter reduced transcription by 50% and combined deletion of both AP-1 and CCAAT cis-acting elements entirely eliminated radiation-mediated transcriptional activation. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay of the nuclear proteins isolated from irradiated AT fibroblasts demonstrated their increased binding to the CCAAT sequence at 30 min after irradiation. Competition for nuclear protein binding to the CCAAT sequence with excess cold CCAAT demonstrated that protein binding to this sequence was specific. These findings were distinct from induction by phorbol esthers in that the RSRF cis-acting element and DNA segments upstream of -132 base pairs do participate in c-jun induction by phorbol esthers but not by radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-mediated transcriptional regulation of c-jun is prolonged in AT fibroblasts and is regulated in combinatorial control by the AP-1 and CCAAT domains, and transcriptional regulation is distinct from that induced by phorbol esthers.","['Hallahan, D E', 'Dunphy, E', 'Kuchibhotla, J', 'Kraft, A', 'Unlap, T', 'Weichselbaum, R R']","['Hallahan DE', 'Dunphy E', 'Kuchibhotla J', 'Kraft A', 'Unlap T', 'Weichselbaum RR']","['Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)'],IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics/pathology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/radiation effects', 'G1 Phase/genetics/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Genes, jun/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Transcription, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Transfection']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301696003276 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00327-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Sep 1;36(2):355-60. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00327-6.,,,"['CA42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1986 and August 1993, 75 patients with AML ranging in age from 6 months to 58 years underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation using previously harvested and frozen unpurged (n = 6) or 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide purged marrows (n = 69). Patients were in first CR (n = 44) or beyond first CR (n = 31). The preparative regimen consisted of 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (CY) and 1320 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) in eight fractions over 4 days (CY/TBI) in 29 patients; and 16 mg/kg of Busulfan (BU) and 200 mg/kg of CY (BU/CY) in 46 patients. Thirty-five of these 75 patients (18 CY/TBI and 17 BU/CY) were part of a randomized trial comparing the two preparative regimens. RESULTS: At 2 years, overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49% [95% confidence interval (C.I.) 37-61%] and 43% (95% C.I. 32-55%), respectively. Patients in first CR had a significantly better outcome than patients beyond first CR with an estimated 2-year DFS of 59% (95% C.I. 44-74%) vs. 21% (95% C.I. 5-36%, log-rank p = 0.0001), respectively. For patients conditioned with CY/TBI, the estimated 2-year DFS was 52% compared to 39% for BU/CY (log-rank p = 0.35). Estimated 2-year relapse rates were 44% vs. 56% (log-rank p = 0.40), respectively. For patients in first CR, no differences in DFS were observed between the two regimens (2-year estimates 69% vs. 55% log-rank p = 0.52). Patients beyond first CR had a significantly improved DFS with the CY/TBI regimen (2-year estimates of 38% vs. 7%, log-rank p = 0.04). No differences were found between the two regimens in terms of time to WBC engraftment, absolute neutrophil count of > 500, incidence of bacteremias, or median time to hospital discharge. Interstitial pneumonitis developed in two patients (one BU/CY, one CY/TBI) and venoocclusive disease developed in seven BU/CY patients (Fishers exact test p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: For patients beyond first CR, the CY/TBI regiment provided a better outcome, with a significantly better disease-free survival and less venoocclusive disease. For patients in first CR, no significant difference between the two regimens was found. The high relapse rate, especially for patients with advanced disease, emphasizes the need for early transplantation and for new strategies to improve outcome.","['Dusenbery, K E', 'Steinbuch, M', 'McGlave, P B', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Blazar, B R', 'Neglia, J P', 'Litz, C', 'Kersey, J H', 'Woods, W G']","['Dusenbery KE', 'Steinbuch M', 'McGlave PB', 'Ramsay NK', 'Blazar BR', 'Neglia JP', 'Litz C', 'Kersey JH', 'Woods WG']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301696003240 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00324-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Sep 1;36(2):335-43. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00324-0.,,,"['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants with radiological signs of leukodystrophy (n = 14), all within the irradiated CNS prophylaxis group showed significantly prolonged P100 latencies and had a 6.1-fold increased relative risk to develop VEP disturbances. No correlation could be established between VEP outcome and illness- or treatment-related parameters. VEP outcome was not correlated with age at diagnosis or gender.

The muscles from the LIF-injected denervation groups were analysed for muscle fibre area; this was found to be significantly larger than controls. The greatest change was observed in the reinnervation group, where the muscle fibre area following LIF treatment was 53% (Type 1) and 84% (Type 2) greater. In addition, nerve fibre diameters were analysed in the reinnervation-treated group and these were also significantly larger.

The vital status of the cohort was determined through a variety of sources over an observation period of 17 years (1976-1992). Mortality data were analyzed in terms of cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with expected deaths based on U.S. national mortality rates. Job categories with similar exposures were created based on an historical exposure assessment. Mortality analyses were performed separately for total female and male employees. Among female employees, overall mortality was less than expected, and no significant cause-specific mortality excesses were observed. The small number of deaths among female employees did not permit further detailed analyses. Among male employees, statistically significant deficits from overall mortality (SMR = 69.0) and from all cancers (SMR = 71.3) were reported. In addition, low mortality risks for many specific causes were also observed, including many specific cancer sites, various types of cardiovascular diseases, and different forms of nonmalignant respiratory diseases. In particular, there was no mortality excess from lung cancer (SMR = 77.5), digestive cancer (SMR = 69.4), stomach cancer (SMR = 46.7), laryngeal cancer (no observed death), rectal cancer (SMR = 82.8). Hodgkin's lymphoma (no observed death), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR = 103.6), leukemia (SMR = 72.2), diabetes mellitus (SMR = 110.4), ischemic heart disease (SMR = 80.0), and nonmalignant respiratory diseases (SMR = 36.7). Furthermore, detailed analyses by length of employment, interval since hire (latency), and job category demonstrated no occupationally related mortality increases from any of the diseases examined. Specifically, based on internal comparisons, no upward trends in cause-specific mortality risk were observed by duration of employment.

Interest in the health effects of electric-power EMF has been motivated by several epidemiologic studies showing weak associations between surrogate measures of low-level EMF exposure and both childhood cancers and adult cancers. Due to the ubiquitous presence of electric power, the public health implications of this association are potentially very significant; however, good evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to EMF and any health effect has not been found. Yet, uncertainty, plus the suggestive epidemiologic findings, have fueled public anxiety and media attention. To put this potential health threat into perspective, it is important to consider the strength of the epidemiology, the availability of supporting animal studies, and mechanistic or biophysical information about the interaction of EMF with matter.

However, it is not clarified whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of 78 and 92 kDa proteins in RBL-2H3 cells is regulated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). In this study, therefore, the effect of depletion of PKC in RBL-2H3 cells, or the influence of PKC, PI3-kinase and tyrosine kinase inhibitors on histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells was examined. The elimination of PKC in RBL-2H3 cells induced significant suppression of histamine release, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of 78 and 92 kDa proteins was not inhibited. The inhibition of histamine release was also observed by the treatment with a PKC inhibitor such as H-7, calphostin C, a PI3-kinase inhibitor such as wortmannin or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as ST638, genistein, hervimycin A, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins was inhibited by only ST638. These results suggest that the 78 kDa protein in RBL-2H3 cells is not identical to the protein-tyrosine kinase PTK72 and the tyrosine phosphorylation of 78 and 92 kDa proteins in RBL-2H3 cells occurs upstream of PKC and PI3-kinase activation or is regulated independently of the PKC- and PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway.","['Matsui, K', 'Miyamoto, H']","['Matsui K', 'Miyamoto H']","['Department of Microbiology, Meiji College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

LIF mRNA is virtually undetectable in uninjured SCG, but is induced by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). The SC1 Schwann cell line was used to study this regulatory mechanism. LIF mRNA increased five-to-tenfold in SC1 cells when IL-1 receptors were stimulated with IL-1. The action of IL-1 is thought to be mediated by the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), which has been suggested to stimulate a ceramide-dependent protein kinase pathway, much like tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, stimulation of the ceramide-dependent protein kinase pathways in SC1 cells with either 2-acetylceramide or sphingomyelinase treatment does not induce LIF mRNA accumulation, but 2-acetylceramide addition induces cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in parallel experiments. Inhibition of phosphotidylcholine-phospholipase C activity, endosomal acidification, or activity of atypical protein kinase C reduce LIF induction by IL-1. These results are consistent with IL-1 regulation of LIF mRNA through stimulation of the endosomal, acidic sphingomyelinase pathway, leading to ceramide activation of protein kinase C zeta. Utilization of this branch of the ceramide signaling pathway may be cell type specific or may be specific for the LIF mRNA response.","['Carlson, C D', 'Hart, R P']","['Carlson CD', 'Hart RP']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endosomes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199609)18:1<49::AID-GLIA5>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199609)18:1<49::AID-GLIA5>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Glia. 1996 Sep;18(1):49-58. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199609)18:1<49::AID-GLIA5>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,"['MH 00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 51564/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 30560/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a previous study it appeared that especially early steps in the signal transduction leading to exocytosis were influenced by oxatomide. We now studied effects of oxatomide on those early steps in more detail. The antigen- and thapsigargin-mediated exocytosis in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were both inhibited by oxatomide. After aggregation of high affinity receptors for immunoglobulin E (Fc epsilon RI), protein tyrosine phosphorylation is induced. Oxatomide caused remarkable changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in resting cells. Also after antigen and thapsigargin activation, changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins are observed. In addition, Ca2+ fluxes were studied by means of the net influx of 45Ca2+ and by measuring intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]) with the fluorescent probe fura-2. Oxatomide inhibited the 45Ca2+ influx and the increase in [Ca2+]i upon antigen and thapsigargin activation of the cells. Neither the release of Ca2+ from internal stores nor the efflux of Ca2+ over the plasma membrane seems to be affected. The effect of oxatomide on Ca2+ influx was further characterized by studying Ba2+ influx in the absence of extracellular free Ca2+. We conclude that inhibition of mediator release is mainly caused by inhibition of influx of extracellular Ca2+, via plasma membrane Ca2+ channels that are activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The molecular mechanism with which oxatomide might interfere with these channels is discussed.","['Paulussen, J J', 'Fischer, M J', 'Kok-Van Esterik, J A', 'Tiemessen, R C', 'De Mol, N J', 'Janssen, L H']","['Paulussen JJ', 'Fischer MJ', 'Kok-Van Esterik JA', 'Tiemessen RC', 'De Mol NJ', 'Janssen LH']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Utrecht University, Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'J31IL9Z2EE (oxatomide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/09/19 00:00,1996/09/19 00:01,['1996/09/19 00:00'],"['1996/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014299996004530 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-2999(96)00453-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1996 Sep 19;312(1):121-30. doi: 10.1016/0014-2999(96)00453-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine thymocytes and B cells, human leukemia cells, and normal peripheral blood leukocytes were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with specific stimuli or by incubation in growth factor-deprived medium. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to measure changes in phosphotyrosine content that correlated with the appearance of features of programmed cell death, such as cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and loss of membrane integrity. The results show that conditions that induced apoptosis also induced a dramatic decrease in cellular phosphotyrosine levels. Tyrosine dephosphorylation preceded the loss of plasma membrane integrity and, in most cases, was temporally correlated with the onset of DNA fragmentation. The protein tyrosine phosphatase antagonist pervanadate had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both dephosphorylation and apoptosis in murine thymocytes, which were treated with dexamethasone or with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. The results suggest that extensive tyrosine dephosphorylation is an intrinsic part of the apoptotic process of hematopoietic cells and may be involved mechanistically in the apoptosis induced by certain stimuli.","['Lund-Johansen, F', 'Frey, T', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Thompson, P A']","['Lund-Johansen F', 'Frey T', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Thompson PA']","['Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California, USA. johansen@dnax.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (pervanadate)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961001)25:2<182::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961001)25:2<182::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1996 Oct 1;25(2):182-90. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19961001)25:2<182::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanisms by which different cytokines modulate the expression of macrophage LPL activity are poorly understood. The action of six cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on LPL function using the murine J774.2 cell line as a model system has, therefore, been studied. Although exposure to LPS, interleukin 11 (IL-11), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-1, over the physiological range of concentrations, resulted in a decrease in the heparin-releasable LPL activity, LPL-mRNA levels and LPL-protein content of the cells, stimulation with IL-6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) had no effect. The maximum suppression of LPL activity and mRNA levels in the cells by IFN-gamma (60%) was lower than that produced by LPS, IL-11, TNF-alpha and IL-1 (78-97%). Each cytokine displayed a characteristic dose-dependent pattern for the suppression of LPL activity and mRNA levels with IL-11/TNF-alpha being more potent than IFN-gamma/IL-1. More than 80% of the decrease in the LPL activity, at all doses of IL-11, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-1, was due to a corresponding reduction in the mRNA levels. The time course of responses to LPS, IL-11, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-1 were similar, with the time required to achieve half maximal suppression of LPL activity being between 7 and 9.5 h in each case. These results indicate that LPL in J774.2 macrophages is regulated differentially by various cytokines and that the major control responsible for the reduction of LPL activity by IL-11, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-1 is exerted at the level of mRNA metabolism (decreased transcription or RNA stability). The responses identified also displayed several differences to those described previously for adipocytes (e.g. 3T3-L1 cell line), thereby suggesting the existence of potential cell-specific mechanisms for the regulation of LPL by cytokines.","['Tengku-Muhammad, T S', 'Hughes, T R', 'Cryer, A', 'Ramji, D P']","['Tengku-Muhammad TS', 'Hughes TR', 'Cryer A', 'Ramji DP']","['School of Molecular and Medical Biosciences, University of Wales Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(96)90071-X [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1996.0071 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1996 Jul;8(7):525-33. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1996.0071.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Quantitative PCR System 5000 (QPCR-5000; Perkin-Elmer) is a new instrument system that uses electrochemiluminescence to automatically quantitate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. A comparative study between radioactively labeled PCR (32P-PCR) and QPCR was performed to analyze the MDR1 gene expression in the drug-resistant (Doxorubicin) cell lines Dox40, Dox6, the parental cell line 8226/S, CEM Dox1 and three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. Using the Dox40 and Dox6 resistant cell lines, we compared the sensitivities of QPCR and 32P-PCR. A strong signal was obtained from QPCR at 20 to 25 cycles (which is in the linear range for quantitation), while a weak signal was obtained using 32P-PCR at the same cycle number. Dilution experiments gave better precision with the QPCR than with the radioactive method. AML samples were studied with the MDR1-specific MAbs MRK16 and 4E3, and the efflux function was analyzed using Rh-123 retention in the absence or presence of verapamil. The three samples showed high (D = 0.79), medium (D = 0.52) and negative (D = 0.08) p-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels and correlated with efflux function.

DNP-poly[A] was found to enter the virus spontaneously and to completely inhibit the RT within 30 min at 0 degree C. The inhibitor was also spontaneously transported into isolated human lymphocytes and leukocytes at 37 degrees C. Animal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of DNP-poly[A] as an antiviral drug when administered intraperitoneally at various doses from 1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight. MuLV-infected mice show the presence of RT in their blood as well as increased numbers of leukocytes. After the administration of DNP-poly[A] at a dosage of 100 mg/kg of body weight three times a week over a 3-week period, RT could no longer be detected by an ultrasensitive RT-PCR assay. Autopsy showed that the spleens of infected but untreated mice were enlarged 2- to 10-fold, with fused nodules and the proliferation of large abnormal lymphocytes, whereas the spleens of infected but treated mice resembled the normal spleens of uninfected control mice. These observations indicate that further study of DNP-poly[A] as a general antiretroviral agent is desirable.","['Ashun, M A', 'Hu, Y', 'Kang, I', 'Li, C C', 'Wang, J H']","['Ashun MA', 'Hu Y', 'Kang I', 'Li CC', 'Wang JH']","['Bioenergetics Laboratory, Natural Sciences Center, State University of New York, Buffalo 14260-3000.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', ""0 (poly(2'-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl))poly(adenylic acid))"", '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dinitrobenzenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ethylene Oxide/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Organ Size/drug effects/physiology', 'Poly A/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sepharose/chemistry']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.40.10.2311 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1996 Oct;40(10):2311-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.40.10.2311.,PMC163526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scale-up production of this immunotoxin, called DA7, was simplified using a two-step purification protocol that resulted in a highly purified immunotoxin meeting FDA criteria for IND approval. The anti-CD7 antibody, 3Ale, an IgG2b, was coupled to toxin using two different heterobifunctional cross-linkers, (1) N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyl-dithiolproprionate) (SPDP), considered a standard croslinker and (2) 4-succinimidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyldithio)tolu ene (SMPT), designed to hinder the in vivo breakdown of the toxin/antibody disulfide bond. Since experiments revealed that SPDP-DA7 had similar pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice and higher yields than DA7 made with a hindered cross-linker, SPDP-DA7 was scaled up for clinical study. Yield of SPDP-DA7 was 25% relative to starting material. Fractions were collected containing a toxin: antibody ratio of 1:1 to 4:1 rather than only a 1:1 ratio since studies showed that this heterogenous fraction was just as toxic to proliferating CD7-expressing leukemia cells as a homogeneous 1:1 fraction. In vitro, the concentration of heterogenous SPDP-DA7 selectively inhibiting 50% activity (IC50) of the CD7+ CEM cell line was 0.01 microgram/ml to 0.05 microgram/ml for inhibiting activated T cells or T cell lines. In vivo, SPDP-DA7 showed a significant anti-tumor effect against CEM cells administered to scid/scid mice, but even more importantly was effective against primary T cell leukemias taken from patients and injected into scid/scid mice.","['Vallera, D A', 'Burns, L J', 'Frankel, A E', 'Sicheneder, A R', 'Gunther, R', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K', 'Pennell, C A', 'Kersey, J H']","['Vallera DA', 'Burns LJ', 'Frankel AE', 'Sicheneder AR', 'Gunther R', 'Gajl-Peczalska K', 'Pennell CA', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Immunotoxins/*isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ricin/*chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/10/16 00:00,1996/10/16 00:01,['1996/10/16 00:00'],"['1996/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(96)00127-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(96)00127-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1996 Oct 16;197(1-2):69-83. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(96)00127-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent pharmacokinetic studies have revealed a prolonged release of the cytotoxic agent cytosine arabinoside (araC) from hepatocytes into the systemic circulation, resulting in a half-life of approximately 24 h for araC. The specific pharmacokinetic characteristics of cytarabine ocfosfate lead to a prolonged exposure of leukemic cells to this antineoplasstic agent during the 14-day cycle. the oral applicability during outpatient treatment and the sustained antineoplastic activity of araC against slowly proliferating leukemic B-cells suggest that cytarabine ocfosfate might be a useful drug in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Four years after diagnosis of B-CLL, a 50-year-old patient was started on cytarabine ocfosfate. Sequentially, the patient's disease had proved refractory to treatment with chlorambucil/prednisone (31 months), fludarabine (5 months), and prednimustine/mitoxantrone (3 months). These established regimens were discontinued because of increasing lymphocytosis, significant thrombocytopenia, and progressive B-symptoms.

The prolonged half-life of human alpha-globin mRNA, a major determinant of normal erythroid differentiation, is dependent on the assembly of a sequence-specific 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) RNP (alpha-complex). We demonstrate that the stability of murine alpha-globin mRNA is controlled by a parallel mechanism. Unexpectedly, however, the respective 3'UTR RNP complexes that stabilize the h(alpha)- and m(alpha)-globin mRNAs differ in structure. While the cis determinants in both species are encoded in polypyrimidine tracks, the human determinant is C-rich (CCUCC motif) while the mouse alpha-3'UTR consists of an equal distribution of Cs and Us (CCUUCU motif). The protein components of the corresponding human and murine alpha-complexes differ in a complementary manner: the previously described 39 kDa poly(C) binding protein (PCBP) present in the human alpha-complex is replaced in the mouse alpha-complex by a 48 kDa cytoplasmic poly(CU) binding protein (CUBP). These results reveal that drift in the primary sequences of the alpha-globin mRNA 3'UTR polypyrimidine tracks in a comparison between mouse and human is paralleled by an alteration in the composition of the corresponding trans-acting components. Surprisingly, these structurally distinct complexes appear to perform the identical function of stabilizing the corresponding alpha-globin mRNAs.","['Wang, X', 'Liebhaber, S A']","['Wang X', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (messenger ribonucleoprotein)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)', '26427-29-2 (poly(U-C))', '27416-86-0 (Poly U)', '30811-80-4 (Poly C)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Globins/genetics', 'Half-Life', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poly C/metabolism', 'Poly U/metabolism', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/16 00:00,1996/09/16 00:01,['1996/09/16 00:00'],"['1996/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Sep 16;15(18):5040-51.,PMC452243,,['P60-HL38632/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the APL-specific PML/RARalpha fusion protein in hematopoietic precursor cell lines blocks terminal differentiation, suggesting that PML/ RARalpha may have the same activity in APL blasts. We expressed different PML/RARalpha mutants in U937 and TF-1 cells and demonstrated that the integrity of the PML protein dimerization and RARalpha DNA binding domains is crucial for the differentiation block induced by PML/RARalpha, and that these domains exert their functions only within the context of the fusion protein. Analysis of the in vivo dimerization and cell localization properties of the PML/RARalpha mutants revealed that PML/RARalpha--PML and PML/RARalpha--RXR heterodimers are not necessary for PML/RARalpha activity on differentiation.

Serum antibodies to gp46/ 175-Pro-199 were detected more frequently in the IgG (13/17) than in the IgA (5/17) isotypes. The majority (8/12) of anti-gp46/175-Pro-199-positive sera reacted also to gp46/190-Pro-199 or to gp46/ 190-Ser-199, demonstrating their neutralizing properties. In saliva, antibodies to gp46/175-Pro-199 were not generally detected. In cervicovaginal secretions, IgG to gp46/175-Pro-199, but not IgA, were detected in 6/15 (40%) patients. The mean specific activity of IgG to gp46/175-Pro-199 showed a trend to be higher in cervicovaginal secretions (218 +/- 109) than in sera (14 +/- 4). Furthermore, in all patients with cervicovaginal IgG to gp46/175-Pro-199, the cervicogaginal/serum ratio (19 +/- 6) of anti-gp46 IgG specific activities were markedly above 1. HTLV-DNA was detected in 4/17 salivas, and in 3/15 cervicovaginal secretions, all from patients demonstrating cervicovaginal synthesis of IgG to gp46/175-Pro-199. In conclusion, IgG to gp46/175-Pro-199 in cervicovaginal secretions, when present, appear to be produced primarily locally because of local HTLV-I excretion. Since anti-gp46/175-Pro-199 antibodies usually support reactivities to neutralizing domains, their presence could be relevant for limiting HTLV-I transmission via cervicovaginal secretions.","['Belec, L', 'Georges-Courbot, M C', 'Georges, A', 'Mohamed, A S', 'Londos-Gagliardi, D', 'Hallouin, M C', 'Hocini, H', 'Guillemain, B']","['Belec L', 'Georges-Courbot MC', 'Georges A', 'Mohamed AS', 'Londos-Gagliardi D', 'Hallouin MC', 'Hocini H', 'Guillemain B']","['Laboratory of Virology, Broussais Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cervix Uteri/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Vagina/immunology/pathology/*virology']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9071(199609)50:1<42::AID-JMV9>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9071(199609)50:1<42::AID-JMV9>3.0.CO;2-T [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Virol. 1996 Sep;50(1):42-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9071(199609)50:1<42::AID-JMV9>3.0.CO;2-T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uptake of daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (ADR) was also concentration-dependent, and the transport of ADR consisted of saturable and nonsaturable components. In cis-inhibition experiments, ADR inhibited both THP and DNR uptake noncompetitively, while DNR showed competitive inhibition of the uptake of THP. The THP uptake rate appeared to be increased by preloading DNR, indicating a trans-stimulatory effect, but not with ADR.

Before in vivo evaluation, polymer-drug binding characteristics were checked by gel-chromatography. Gel-chromatographs proposed the covalent binding of 1a-(4-carboxybutyryl)-MMC (glu-MMC) with both the polymer supports. The plasma concentration of MMC showed that each conjugate released MMC in vivo at a similar rate. Kinetic analysis suggested that the in vivo drug release should be considerably faster than the in vitro release in the buffer, pH 7.4, alone. In the treatment against P388 leukemia inoculated intraperitoneally, Gly-chitosan-glu-MMC showed the highest increase in life span (ILS) at 10 mg MMC eq/kg. It was lethally toxic at the dose of 20 mg MMC eq/kg, while N-Suc-chitosan-glu-MMC gave the highest ILS value at this dose. Each conjugate exhibited a little larger ILS value than MMC. For the Sarcoma 180 solid tumor inoculated subcutaneously, the polymer characteristics affected the antitumor effect. Namely, with the intravenous injection, Gly-chitosan-glu-MMC hardly exhibited any tumor growth inhibition, but N-Suc-chitosan-glu-MMC showed significant tumor growth suppression. As to the intratumoral administration, the tendency to suppress tumor growth was observed in MMC and both the conjugates.","['Sato, M', 'Onishi, H', 'Takahara, J', 'Machida, Y', 'Nagai, T']","['Sato M', 'Onishi H', 'Takahara J', 'Machida Y', 'Nagai T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Glycols)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Succinates)', '1398-61-4 (Chitin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biopolymers', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chitin/analogs & derivatives', 'Chitosan', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Glycols', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitomycin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Mitomycins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy', 'Succinates', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.1170 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Sep;19(9):1170-7. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.1170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural requirement for high molecular weight polymers for potentiation of bleomycin cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells under conditions of vortex-stirring.,1126-9,"As we previously reported, the cytotoxicity of bleomycin (BLM) toward cultured mammalian cells was extraordinarily potentiated when the cells and BLM were vortex-stirred for a few seconds in the presence of high molecular weight polyacrylic acid (PAA). Cationic and nonionic polymers could not take the place of PAA in potentiating BLM cytotoxicity. The present study revealed that potentiation was sharply dependent on the molecular weight of PAA and a molecular weight of over 10(6) daltons seemed to be required. Copolymers of acrylic acid (AA) and acrylamide showed some potentiation which was relative to their AA content. It is worth noting that another type of anionic polymer, polymethacrylic acid, did not show any potentiating capacity at all. Polyacrylic sulfonate derivative showed a marginal capacity. The structural requirement for high molecular weight polymers for potentiation of BLM cytotoxicity was demonstrated by the increased uptake of Lucifer Yellow, a non-permeant material. In addition, the ability of permeabilization was not correlated with kinematic viscosity of anionic polymers.","['Shimizu, N', 'Nakamura, M', 'Azuchi, M', 'Okada, M', 'Kawazoe, Y']","['Shimizu N', 'Nakamura M', 'Azuchi M', 'Okada M', 'Kawazoe Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Polymers)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '9654F8OVKE (lucifer yellow)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Bleomycin/*toxicity', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Isoquinolines', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Viscosity']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.1126 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Sep;19(9):1126-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.1126.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the factors involved in the height loss between irradiation and adult height and its markers in 43 patients irradiated at 5.8 +/- 0.4 (SEM) years. The mean height loss was 0.9 +/- 0.2 SD in the children with a normal GH peak (n = 11), 1.7 +/- 0.2 SD in those with a low GH peak and untreated (n = 15) and 0.6 +/- 0.2 SD in those treated with GH (n = 17). The adult height was significantly lower than target height in all three groups. The height loss correlated negatively with the GH peak (p < 0.02) and with the age at onset of puberty (p < 0.05) in the first two groups with spontaneous growth, but not with the chemotherapy regimen or its duration, or the plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) and its GH-dependent binding protein (BP-3). Early puberty (onset at 8-10 years) occurred in 6 girls from the first two groups. At the first evaluation, 5.6 +/- 0.4 years after irradiation, the GH peak values after arginine-insulin stimulation correlated with the age at irradiation (p < 0.03), taking into account the time since irradiation. The plasma IGFI and BP-3 values were correlated with each other, but not with the GH peak. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the impact of GH deficiency and GH replacement therapy on adult height in children given cranial irradiation for leukaemia. They therefore should be evaluated for their GH secretion 1-2 years after the end of chemotherapy. GH therapy is indicated for those with low GH peak and decreased growth rate or no increase in growth rate despite puberty.","['Adan, L', 'Souberbielle, J C', 'Blanche, S', 'Leverger, G', 'Schaison, G', 'Brauner, R']","['Adan L', 'Souberbielle JC', 'Blanche S', 'Leverger G', 'Schaison G', 'Brauner R']","['Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Universite Paris V, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Growth', 'Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Puberty', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1996.tb14224.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1996 Sep;85(9):1096-101. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1996.tb14224.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-six patients were enrolled and received vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and an anthracycline as reinduction therapy. Ninety-two patients were randomized to receive either daunomycin (DNR) or idarubicin (IDR). After achievement of second complete remission (CR2), maintenance chemotherapy included the same anthracycline, IDR or DNR, high-dose cytarabine, and escalating-dose methotrexate. Compared to DNR (45 mg/m2/week x 3), IDR (12.5 mg/m2/week x 3) was associated with prolonged myelosuppression and more frequent serious infections. Halfway through the study, the dose of IDR was reduced to 10 mg/m2. Overall, second remission was achieved in 71% of patients. Reinduction rate was similar for IDR and DNR. Reasons for induction failure differed; none of 15, 1 of 5, and 5 of 7 reinduction failures were due to infection for DNR, IDR (10 mg/m2), and IDR (12.5 mg/m2), respectively. Two-year event-free survival (EFS) was better among patients who received IDR (12.5 mg/m2) (27 +/- 18%) compared to DNR (10 +/- 8%, P = 0.05) and IDR (10 mg/m2) (6 +/- 12%, P = 0.02). However, after 3 years of follow-up, late events in the high-dose IDR group result in a similar EFS to the lower-dose IDR and DNR groups. In conclusion, IDR is an effective agent in childhood ALL. When used weekly at 12.5 mg/m2 during induction, the EFS outcome during the first 2 years of treatment appears better than lower-dose IDR or DNR (45 mg/m2), although this difference was not sustained at longer periods of follow-up.

Due to the importance of the transfer in this tissue, we have started this study. JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cells in monolayer at confluency were used as a model for measuring the key enzymes of polyamine synthesis and interconversion, rate of uptake and efflux, and the polyamine content. Polyamines were taken up by JAR cells and released by an independent mechanism. Ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine acetyltransferase activities and the rate of transport in and out of the cell were much higher than in other cells, such as L1210 cells. However the systems used for uptake and release appear in many respects to be similar to those observed in L1210 cells, but different from others. The uptake appears to be regulated by an inhibitory protein. Moreover, protein kinase C appears to be involved in the process. The efflux also is regulated as in L1210 cells, through control of H+ and Ca2+ concentration. In conclusion, this study shows that, in JAR cells, ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine acetyltransferase activities were much higher than in other cells, and so was the rate of transport in and out of the cells. As a result, a much higher polyamine content was observed.","['Fontana, L', 'Cravanzola, C', 'Colombatto, S', 'Grillo, M A']","['Fontana L', 'Cravanzola C', 'Colombatto S', 'Grillo MA']","['Dipartimento de Medicina e Oncologia Sperimentale, Sezione di Biochimica, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biogenic Polyamines/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Choriocarcinoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Placenta Diseases/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(199609)14:3<173::AID-CBF664>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/cbf.664 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1996 Sep;14(3):173-80. doi: 10.1002/cbf.664.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 1 h incubation with CPT, the doses that inhibited growth by 50 per cent (ID50) after 48 h of incubation were 0.54 microM for LY-R cells and 1.25 microM for LY-S cells. Initial numbers of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) measured at this level of growth inhibition were two-fold higher in LY-R (5.6 Gray-equivalents) than in LY-S cells (3.1 Gray-equivalents), which corresponds well with the greater in vitro sensitivity of Topo I from LY-R cells to CPT. Conversely, the initial levels of single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) were lower in LY-R cells (4.2 Gray-equivalent SSBs and 5.8 Gray equivalent DSBs) than in LY-S cells (8.0 Gray-equivalent SSBs and 12.0 Gray-equivalent DSBs). Dissimilarity in the replication-dependent DNA damage observed after 1 h of treatment with CPT was not due to a difference in the rate of DNA synthesis between the two cell lines, but may have arisen from a substantially slower repair of DNA breaks in LY-S cells. Release from G2 block by caffeine co-treatment significantly increased cell killing in the LY-S subline, and only slightly inhibited growth of LY-R cells. These results show that after CPT treatment cells arrest in G2, allowing them time to repair the long-lived DSBs. As LY-S cells are slower in repairing the DSBs, they were more susceptible to CPT in the presence of caffeine.","['Gradzka, I', 'Szumiel, I']","['Gradzka I', 'Szumiel I']","['Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(199609)14:3<163::AID-CBF672>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/cbf.672 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1996 Sep;14(3):163-71. doi: 10.1002/cbf.672.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPO levels were considerably elevated in patients with myelosuppression after intensification chemotherapy of acute leukemia in complete remission (postchemotherapy group; n = 18; 18.46 +/- 9.70 f mol/ml).

Bulk T1 values were compared in all patients with AML or ALL and in those who did or did not respond to treatment. RESULTS: MR imaging of lumbar bone marrow demonstrated statistically significant differences in initial bulk T1 values and in changes in bulk T1 values during treatment between patients with ALL and those with AML. Changes in bulk T1 after the 2nd week of treatment were statistically significantly different between patients with and those without a response who had ALL but not in those with AML.

RESULTS: Positive cortical vein sign was seen at US in 12 patients (group A): nine with benign enlargement of subarachnoid spaces, two with brain atrophy, and one with meningococcal meningitis. The veins were displaced and embedded within the echogenic pia-arachnoid that surrounds the brain or were trapped in the subarachnoid spaces between the neo-membrane and cortical surface (group B, negative cortical vein sign) in four patients with meningitis, two victims of child abuse, and one patient with leukemia.

E26 can block both erythroid and myeloid differentiation at an early multipotent stage. Moreover, E26 can block erythroid differentiation at the erythroid burst-forming unit/erythroid CFU (BFU-E/CFU-E) stage, which also corresponds to the differentiation stage blocked by AEV. AEV carries two oncogenes, v-erbA and v-erbB, whereas E26 encodes a single 135-kDa Gag-Myb-Ets fusion oncoprotein. v-ErbA is responsible for the erythroid differentiation arrest through negative interferences with both the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R/c-ErbA). We investigated whether Myb-Ets could block erythroid differentiation in a manner similar to v-ErbA. We show here that Myb-Ets inhibits both RAR and c-ErbA activities on specific hormone response elements in transient-expression assays. Moreover, Myb-Ets abrogates the inactivation of transcription factor AP-1 by RAR and T3R, another feature shared with v-ErbA. Myb-Ets also antagonizes the biological response of erythrocytic progenitor cells to retinoic acid and T3. Analysis of a series of mutants of Myb-Ets reveals that the domains of the oncoprotein involved in these inhibitory activities are the same as those involved in oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells. These data demonstrate that the Myb-Ets oncoprotein shares properties with the v-ErbA oncoprotein and that inhibition of ligand-dependent RAR and c-ErbA functions by Myb-Ets is responsible for blocking the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors.","['Rascle, A', 'Ferrand, N', 'Gandrillon, O', 'Samarut, J']","['Rascle A', 'Ferrand N', 'Gandrillon O', 'Samarut J']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire de l'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, UMR49 CNRS, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.11.6338 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Nov;16(11):6338-51. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.11.6338.,PMC231636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of IVIg on peripheral blood NK cell activity in vitro in women with RSA. 51Cr-release assays using K562 in the presence of varying concentrations of IVIg were performed using PBL from 16 women with RSA. Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was evaluated using Daudi cells. Effectors and targets were preincubated with IVIg. Binding of IVIg to K562 and Daudi was evaluated by flow cytometry. The effect of K562 absorbed IVIg on NK activity was compared to that of non-absorbed IVIg. NK cytotoxicity and ADCC in the presence of F(ab')2 fragments were compared with those in the presence of intact IVIg. IVIg produced a significant, dose dependent inhibition of NK activity in vitro. Inhibition of NK activity occurred when effectors but not targets were preincubated with IVIg. IVIg binds to K562 and Daudi. IVIg increased ADCC when targets but not effectors were incubated with IVIg. K562 absorbed IVIg produced more inhibition of NK cytotoxicity than non-absorbed IVIg. Suppression of NK cytotoxicity by F(ab')2 was as effective as that of IVIg. However, F(ab')2 did not increase ADCC. IVIg effectively reduces peripheral blood NK cytotoxicity in vitro. Inhibition of NK cytotoxicity is mediated at the effector cell level through the antigen binding portion of the immunoglobulins.

On the other hand, TNF-alpha induced the most mature ME-F1 cells and intermediate ME-F3 cells to differentiate along the monocytic pathway. TNF-alpha also enhanced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced complement C2 production by ME-F1 and ME-F3 cells but did not affect production by differentiated ME-F1 and ME-F3 cells.

They comprise over 95% of the total single-strand DNase activity in nuclei and are mainly bound to chromatin and the nuclear matrix. The activated enzyme had Mg2+(Mn2+)-dependent, Ca(2+)-stimulated activities with single- and double-strand DNAs and RNA (polyriboadenylic acid) and other properties characteristic of endo-exonucleases previously described. At least twice as much inactive endo-exonuclease has also been localised in extranuclear compartments of CEM and MOLT-4 cells, 85% bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and 15% free in the cytosol. The soluble cytosolic trypsin-activatable endo-exonuclease was immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised independently to both Neurospora and monkey CV-1 cell endo-exonucleases. The free and bound enzymes of both nuclear and extranuclear compartments also cross-reacted on immunoblots with the antibody raised to Neurospora endo-exonuclease to reveal multiple polypeptides ranging in size from 18 to 145 kDa, many of which exhibited activity on DNA gels. The major species bound to the chromatin/matrix were in the 55-63 kDa range. Limited proteolysis of the large polypeptides to those of 18 to 46 kDa accompanied spontaneous chromatin DNA fragmentation to form DNA ""ladders' in an isolated nuclei/cytosol system. When the leukaemic cells were treated in culture with either etoposide or podophyllotoxin to induce apoptosis, the largest polypeptides disappeared and smaller endo-exonuclease-related polypeptides of 18 to 46 kDa were detected in the nuclear extracts. The appearance of these polypeptides also correlated with extensive chromatin DNA fragmentation. In addition, there were correlations between the depletion of the major 55-63 kDa species bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, depletion of the extranuclear trypsin-activatable activity and the onset and extent of chromatin DNA fragmentation in both cell lines. The extranuclear 55-63 kDa species may be precursors of the chromatin/matrix bound endo-exonuclease. The results indicate that endo-exonuclease plays a role in chromatin DNA degradation in mammalian cells during apoptosis.","['Fraser, M J', 'Tynan, S J', 'Papaioannou, A', 'Ireland, C M', 'Pittman, S M']","['Fraser MJ', 'Tynan SJ', 'Papaioannou A', 'Ireland CM', 'Pittman SM']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (endoexonuclease)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Endonucleases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Exonucleases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Podophyllotoxin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1996 Sep;109 ( Pt 9):2343-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three methods of infection were employed: (i) simple flushing of the fetal intestine with the vector; (ii) incubation with the vector for 2 hr; and (iii) a combination of both. The first method gave the highest transduction efficiencies in terms of both the proportion of samples that were neo-positive and the number of neo-positive cells per sample. Using this approach, the time course of persistence of neo-positive cells was analyzed by collecting grafts at 1 versus 3 weeks post-infection. The results showed approximately five-fold more positive cells at the earlier time point than at the later, suggesting loss of transduced cells due to cell turnover. Nevertheless, the persistence of a portion of the positive cells for at least 3 weeks is encouraging for future studies with fetal intestine.","['Jacomino, M', 'Lau, C', 'James, S Z', 'Shukla, P', 'Henning, S J']","['Jacomino M', 'Lau C', 'James SZ', 'Shukla P', 'Henning SJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3498, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Recombinant/analysis', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', '*Intestine, Small/chemistry/embryology/*transplantation', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Proviruses', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/09/10 00:00,1996/09/10 00:01,['1996/09/10 00:00'],"['1996/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.14-1757 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Sep 10;7(14):1757-62. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.14-1757.,,,"['R01-DK-44646/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-DK-07664/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report construction of a series of retroviral vectors and identification of an optimal basic structure and components for expressing hFIX in skeletal muscle cells. These vectors, which are derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) with its enhancer sequence in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) deleted, contained internal hFIX expression units inserted in forward configuration without or with a viral vector intron sequence (pdL or pdLIn vector frame, respectively) or in inverted configuration without a viral vector intron sequence (pdLi frame). Internal expression units contained a hFIX cDNA or hFIX minigene (hIXm1 or hIXm2) derived from the hFIX cDNA by insertion of a shortened first intron sequence of the hFIX gene. Regardless of the promoter and vector frame used, both hIXm1 and hIXm2 gave 10- to 14-fold higher hFIX expression compared to those with hFIX cDNA. Internal hFIX transcriptional control units of these vectors were composed of various promoters linked with or without the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (Me) sequence. Promoters tested included those of alpha-actin (alpha A775), beta-actin (beta A280), cytochrome oxidase (CO1250 and CO650), myogenin (Mg1031 and Mg353), and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). beta A200, which was derived from beta A280 by eliminating potential polyadenylation sites, was also tested. As extensively examined with the myogenin promoter, presence of one or multiple copies of Me in the vectors elevated the expression activity in myotubes by 4.5- to 19-fold over those without Me, but not significantly in myoblasts. Similar enhancements in expression activity with Me were also observed with other promoters, except those of RSV and CO. The latter two showed only modest enhancements in the presence of Me. As assayed with myotubes in culture, the general order of hFIX expression activity of various promoters with four copies of Me in the three different vector frames was beta A280 approximately beta A200 > Mg353 > Mg1031 approximately RSV approximately CO650 approximately alpha A775 > CO1250. One exception was that CO650 showed significantly less activity in pdLi-type vectors than in the pdLIn vectors. Based on the systematic analyses of various structural components, a group of pdLi vectors consisting of beta A200, two to four copies of Me, and hIXm2 was identified to have the optimal basic vector structure to be used in retrovirus for hFIX expression in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The present studies provide the critical first step for establishing a highly refined hemophilia B gene therapy based on skeletal muscle-targeted hFIX gene transfer.","['Wang, J M', 'Zheng, H', 'Sugahara, Y', 'Tan, J', 'Yao, S N', 'Olson, E', 'Kurachi, K']","['Wang JM', 'Zheng H', 'Sugahara Y', 'Tan J', 'Yao SN', 'Olson E', 'Kurachi K']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Cation Exchange Resins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipofectamine)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cation Exchange Resins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Factor IX/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/chemistry', '*Muscle, Skeletal/chemistry/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reading Frames/genetics', 'Transfection']",1996/09/10 00:00,1996/09/10 00:01,['1996/09/10 00:00'],"['1996/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.14-1743 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Sep 10;7(14):1743-56. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.14-1743.,,,"['5-P60-AR20557/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 38644/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 53713/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ca(2+)-antagonism of tetrandrine (TET) on the Ca2+ mobilization in various types of cells were reviewed. Inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-generating drugs were used as Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists and the effects were compared with those produced by using the microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG), which is a tool for analysing Ca2+ store-regulated Ca2+ entry (capacitative Ca2+ entry). 2. In rat phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells, 100 mumol/L TET abolished high K+ (30 mmol/L)-induced sustained increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and partially inhibited bradykinin (1 mumol/L)- or TG (100 nmol/L)-induced Ca2+ entry. 3. In NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and rat parotid acinar cells, 100 mumol/L TET abolished Ca2+ entry induced by bombesin (1 mumol/L) and carbachol (100 mumol/L), respectively, or TG (100 nmol/L). However, in the human leukaemia T cell line Jurkat, 100 mumol/L TET did not inhibit Ca2+ entry evoked by either the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (10 mg/L) or TG (100 nmol/L). 4. In rat glioma C6 cells, the effects of TET on Ca2+ mobilization were further examined. At a high concentration, TET (300 mumol/L) alone did not affect [Ca2+]i in C6 cells. Tetrandrine inhibited the peak and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i induced by bombesin and TG in a dose-dependent manner. Although TET or TG did not produce increases in IP3, TET did inhibit increases in IP3 produced by bombesin. 5. Our results suggest that the action of TET on Ca2+ entry is dependent on cell types and that TET inhibits both Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in rat glioma C6 cells.","['Takemura, H', 'Imoto, K', 'Ohshika, H', 'Kwan, C Y']","['Takemura H', 'Imoto K', 'Ohshika H', 'Kwan CY']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'S8TIM42R2W (Bradykinin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Benzylisoquinolines', 'Bradykinin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'PC12 Cells/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Thapsigargin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01772.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 1996 Aug;23(8):751-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01772.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism(s) that underline this activity is/are as yet unknown. One attractive possibility is that the monoterpenes interact with the RAS signal transduction pathway. The monoterpenes have been shown to impair incorporation of mevalonic acid-derived isoprene compounds, that is farnesyl pyrophosphate, into RAS and RAS-related proteins. As farnesylation is critical for RAS's membrane localization and function, the isoprenylation pathways have received attention as potential targets of anti-RAS pharmacological maneuvers. We have expanded on prior studies and demonstrate that one of limonene's metabolic derivatives, perillyl alcohol, decreases the levels of antigenic RAS in the human-derived myeloid THP-1 and lymphoid RPMI-8402 leukemia cell lines. Both limonene and perillyl alcohol decrease levels of 35[S] methionine labeled RAS proteins in cells that have been pulsed with radiolabeled methionine for four hours. In contrast, lovastatin, which inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus depletes cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate, does not diminish levels of total antigenic RAS but rather results in a shift in the RAS protein; levels of farnesylated RAS decrease whereas levels of unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS increase. As limonene and perillyl alcohol do not induce such a shift we conclude that these monoterpenes decrease farnesylated RAS protein levels by a mechanism that is clearly distinct from that of either depleting cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate or inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase that catalyzes the posttranslational farnesylation of RAS. These findings are discussed with respect to implications for the monoterpenes to alter RAS protein synthesis and degradation. The results of these studies will likely impact the inclusion of the monoterpenes in clinical anticancer trials.","['Hohl, R J']",['Hohl RJ'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Terpenes)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/*physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4613-0399-2_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1996;401:137-46. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-0399-2_11.,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, etoposide-containing protocols led to significantly improved survival in patients with at least one poor risk factor. After 612 patient-years of observation no case of secondary leukaemia was observed among 119 surviving patients who had received etoposide as part of their treatment. With a median follow-up of 93 months, five patients developed a second germ cell tumour, two patients nongerm cell malignancies. Fourteen patients relapsed after a disease-free interval of more than 2 years, and nine patients died more than 5 years after commencement of treatment underscoring the need to report long-term results. There is some evidence that cumulative experience translates into improved survival and cure rates for patients with poor-risk metastatic disease.","['Gerl, A', 'Clemm, C', 'Schmeller, N', 'Hartenstein, R', 'Lamerz, R', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Gerl A', 'Clemm C', 'Schmeller N', 'Hartenstein R', 'Lamerz R', 'Wilmanns W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Seminoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.530 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Oct;74(8):1280-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.530.,PMC2075932,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using HTLV type II (HTLV-II) as a model, we recently showed that the function of a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) CRS correlates with in vitro binding by both polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB) protein (also known as hnRNP I) and hnRNP A1 to CRS RNA (1,2). Using radioimmunoprecipitation of proteins ultraviolet (UV) crosslinked to each HIV CRS RNA with monoclonal anti-hnRNP antibodies, we now demonstrate that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 bind to two different HIV-1 CRS RNAs. In addition, we show that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 binding to HIV-1 CRS RNAs can be specifically competed by HTLV-II CRS RNAs using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)/UV crosslinking assays. Binding by both hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 to HIV-1 and HTLV-II CRS RNAs suggests a role for these proteins in CRS function that may be influenced by the Rev and Rex proteins, respectively.","['Black, A C', 'Luo, J', 'Chun, S', 'Bakker, A', 'Fraser, J K', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Black AC', 'Luo J', 'Chun S', 'Bakker A', 'Fraser JK', 'Rosenblatt JD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rev/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein', 'RNA Probes/metabolism', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00284648 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 1996;12(3):275-85. doi: 10.1007/BF00284648.,,,"['CA53632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 CA01566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA61545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the humoral immune response of HaPV-infected Z3 hamsters we produced recombinant HaPV proteins in Escherichia coli as beta-galactosidase-, TrpE- and dihydrofolate reductase-fusion proteins or as non-fused proteins. Recombinant plasmids carried segments of all putative early and late HaPV proteins. The recombinant proteins were detected in stained SDS polyacrylamide gels and in Western blots using monoclonal anti-TrpE and anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies and sera of HaPV-infected hamsters. Sera from HaPV-infected Z3 hamsters and crude lysates of all clones were applied to Western blots to characterize the humoral immune response in the animals. HaPV-specific antibodies were found to be directed against early protein segments translated from the first common exon and from the second unique exon of LT and MT, resp., as well as against the late proteins VP1 and VP2/3.

In addition to the structural genes (gag, pol and env), a gene termed pX is postulated to be associated with leukemogenesis in ATL. Since no effective chemotherapy is currently available, it is important to find suitable therapeutic means against ATL. Here, we tested the inhibitory effect of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on HTLV-I infection in different systems. ODNs were synthesized with the phosphorothioate backbone targeted to either structural genes or transactivator genes. The phosphorothioate ODNs were found to have two distinct target sites to exert their effect on HTLV-I infection: 1) Several ODNs, including sense ODNs and random oligomers, blocked syncytium formation induced by HTLV-I at a concentration of 0.1 microM. Their inhibitory effect on syncytium formation seemed to be exerted in a nonantisense manner, most probably due to their interaction with the cell membrane. 2) Efficient suppression by ODNs of gag gene expression after chemical induction was observed in HTLV-I-transformed T cells in an antisense manner. In this suppression, tax-antisense ODN showed virtually complete inhibition of gag protein expression, but not RNA expression, at the concentration of 0.1 microM, whereas tax-sense ODN displayed a weak inhibitory effect. Our results suggest that the influence of the phosphorothioate compound should be considered from the aspect of two separated mechanisms of antiviral activity, the effects on early (viral adsorption) and late (translation) phase infection.","['Miyano-Kurosaki, N', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Mizuguchi, M', 'Ohki, S', 'Makino, K', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Miyano-Kurosaki N', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Mizuguchi M', 'Ohki S', 'Makino K', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Products, gag/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genes, Viral/*drug effects', 'Genes, pX/*drug effects', 'Giant Cells/*virology', 'HTLV-I Antigens', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00284641 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 1996;12(3):205-17. doi: 10.1007/BF00284641.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From these data, it is speculated that the abnormal proliferation of granulocytes in PMF and CNL may not be due to the stimulation by G-CSF, and that a negative feedback mechanism might exist between peripheral granulocytes and serum G-CSF.","['Saitoh, H', 'Shibata, A']","['Saitoh H', 'Shibata A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Neutrophils', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609054791 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Aug;22(5-6):515-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199609054791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of the patients showed disease progression after several months of PR, and plasma M-CSF increased at that time (t-test: p = 0.0456).

The current staging systems can distinguish prognostic subgroups, but do not seem to predict the risk of disease progression of an individual patient with sufficient accuracy. Given the increase of treatment options for CLL and IC, additional parameters are needed to decide which patients may benefit from early or intensified treatment. It has been shown that two biochemical markers, serum beta 2-microglobulin (s-beta 2M) and serum thymidine kinase (s-TK), might identify CLL and IC patients at high risk of disease progression. Therefore, the prognostic value of these two serum parameters was compared with a panel of several established prognostic factors in a prospective clinical trial. 113 patients with CLL and 41 patients with IC (mean age +/- SD 63.9 +/- 10.7 years) were included. The following parameters were determined: histopathological diagnosis (IC vs. CLL), age, sex, performance status (Karnofsky index), B symptoms, peripheral blood lymphocyte count, platelet count, blood hemoglobin, serum lactate dehydrogenase (s-LDH), s-beta 2M, s-TK, serum creatinine, number of lymph node areas involved, prior therapy, and the time from diagnosis to inclusion in the study. Univariate analyses showed that nine parameters (Karnofsky index, peripheral blood lymphocytosis, platelet count, blood hemoglobin, lymph node areas involved, pretreatment, s-LDH, s-beta 2M, and s-TK) significantly predicted progression-free survival. In a Cox regression model, only four of these parameters provided independent prognostic information on progression-free survival: 1. s-beta 2M, 2. Karnofsky index, 3. platelet count, and 4. s-TK. The results show that s-beta 2M and s-TK independently predict progression-free survival in patients with CLL and IC, and suggest that these prognostic factors may allow an improved prediction of progression-free survival, particularly in early disease stages.","['Hallek, M', 'Wanders, L', 'Ostwald, M', 'Busch, R', 'Senekowitsch, R', 'Stern, S', 'Schick, H D', 'Kuhn-Hallek, I', 'Emmerich, B']","['Hallek M', 'Wanders L', 'Ostwald M', 'Busch R', 'Senekowitsch R', 'Stern S', 'Schick HD', 'Kuhn-Hallek I', 'Emmerich B']","['Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood', 'Time Factors', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*analysis']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609054782 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Aug;22(5-6):439-47. doi: 10.3109/10428199609054782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before sampling all patients received a one hour i.v. infusion of iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd). The proportion of S phase cells was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in bone marrow biopsies, and by flow cytometry (FCM) in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples. The IdUrd labelling index (LI) in bone marrow biopsy sections (27.5 +/- 1.8%) was significantly higher than the proportion of IdUrd labelled cells in bone marrow aspirate (15.1 +/- 2.0%). The percentage of S phase cells in peripheral blood was approximately the same as that in the aspirate (12.4 +/- 1.3%) and was correlated with that of bone marrow aspirate indicating a high degree of the aspirate dilution by peripheral blood. It is likely that the differences in % S phase cells in the aspirate and the biopsy result from this dilution. Estimates of the % S phase cells in the peripheral blood study by IHC and FCM were essentially the same. Samples labelled for one hour in vitro resulted in 1.5 fold higher LI than the same samples labelled in vivo. We conclude that estimates of the 8% S phase cells in the bone marrow of patients with CML should be made by infusing patients with IdUrd or BrdUrd with immunohistochemical evaluation of a marrow biopsy. Additionally in vitro labelling is not reflective of the percent S phase cells in vivo in patients.","['Hegde, U', 'Kotelnikov, V M', 'Handa, H', 'Burke, P', 'Preisler, H D']","['Hegde U', 'Kotelnikov VM', 'Handa H', 'Burke P', 'Preisler HD']","['Rush Cancer Institute, Rush University, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Mitotic Index', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'S Phase']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609054781 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Aug;22(5-6):431-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199609054781.,,,['R0I-CA 60086-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An in vitro transcribed heteropolymeric RNA sequence was used as a template, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with Southern-blot hybridization served as a detection system for the cDNA product of the reaction. Titration of Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations using the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I), respectively, showed optimal assay reactivity for both viruses at 2-20 mM of Mg2+. Analysis of density banded HIV-1 showed that the peak RT activity of the assay was associated with the fractions consistent with retrovirus particles. The sensitivity of Amp-RT was also compared with that of three conventional RT assays by using seven different retroviruses including HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV), HTLV-I and HTLV-II, simian retrovirus type 2 (SRV-2), and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and GALV could not be detected by the three conventional RT assays. Amp-RT was able to detect all these viruses in 10(1)-10(3)-fold dilutions. Similarly, Amp-RT was found to be 10(3)-10(6)-fold more sensitive than the other RT assays in detecting HIV-1, SIV< or CAEV. Culture supernatants from uninfected cell lines were all Amp-RT negative. A quantitative Amp-RT assay was also developed by using recombinant HIV-1 RT and signal quantitation. The assay was found to have a 5 log linear range, and therefore, provides a useful tool for quantitating RT and retroviruses. Amp-RT offers a sensitive generic tool for the qualitative and quantitative detection of known and unknown retroviruses.","['Yamamoto, S', 'Folks, T M', 'Heneine, W']","['Yamamoto S', 'Folks TM', 'Heneine W']","['Retrovirus Diseases Branch, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern/*methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Magnesium', 'Manganese', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sucrose', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-0934(96)02078-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-0934(96)02078-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1996 Sep;61(1-2):135-43. doi: 10.1016/0166-0934(96)02078-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under such conditions, most cells differentiate into prespore cells at pH 5.2. Using this developmental system, the elements controlling prespore-cell differentiation were analyzed. First, the dependence on cell density was examined. At a very low density (10(2) cells/cm2), most cells did not differentiate. As the density was increased the proportion of prespore cells differentiating increased, reaching a maximum at 5 x 10(3) cells/cm2. Conditioned medium could mimic the effects of cell density on cell differentiation. These findings suggest the presence of factor(s) released into the medium which are involved in inducing prespore-cell differentiation. The conditioned medium was found to contain at least two prespore-inducing components; one is a novel factor(s) and the other is DIF, which has previous only been considered to repress prespore-cell differentiation.

The fractions of cats that resisted the induction of persistent viremia after FeLV challenge were as follows: FeLV-61E-A vaccine, 95%; adjuvant controls, 26%; and established commercial control FeLV vaccine, 35%. The prechallenge mean neutralizing antibody titers for each group were as follows: FeLV-61E-A vaccine, 1:43; adjuvant controls, < 1:8; and commercial control FeLV vaccine, 1:12. The prototype FeLV-61E-A vaccine was developed commercially for immunization of pet cats by substitution of a proprietary adjuvant and development of stable, high antigen production cell lines. This vaccine (Fel-O-Vax) has been studied extensively, alone and in multivalent combination with other feline virus vaccines, in seven efficacy trials involving a total of 150 immunized cats. These studies yielded an FeLV-resistant fraction of 87% in vaccinated cats as compared with 8% in adjuvant controls. The duration of immunity induced by an FeLV-61E-A commercial vaccine (Fel-O-Vax-LvK IV) was also assessed. One year after vaccination, 100% of challenged vaccinated cats and none of challenged controls resisted induction of persistent viremia. The results of these studies demonstrate that an inactivated FeLV vaccine prepared from a molecularly cloned subgroup A FeLV produces a high level of protective immunity against heterologous and homologous FeLV infection. This vaccine-induced immunity is durable for at least 1 year without intervening booster immunization or exposure to virus.","['Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I', 'Chu, H J', 'Wasmoen, T L']","['Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI', 'Chu HJ', 'Wasmoen TL']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Vaccines, Inactivated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*prevention & control', '*Vaccines, Inactivated', '*Viral Vaccines']",1996/03/20 00:00,1996/03/20 00:01,['1996/03/20 00:00'],"['1996/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1996.12.379 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1996 Mar 20;12(5):379-83. doi: 10.1089/aid.1996.12.379.,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation was performed in a 43 years old man with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in remission. The donor was his HLA identical brother who had a mild systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoantibodies, including antinuclear, anti-C1q, and anticardiolipin antibodies, were measured before and after transplantation. RESULTS: Transient mild graft versus host disease (GvHD) developed in the recipient in the weeks following transplantation. The donor had persistently high concentrations of anti-C1q antibodies to the collagenous region of the complement component C1q. Three months after transplantation the recipient developed antiC1q antibodies that persisted for two months. No other autoantibodies and no SLE-like manifestations appeared. Chronic GVHD started five months posttransplant and responded to intensified immunosuppressive treatment. Three years post-transplant the patient was in unmaintained remission. Within a few weeks after bone marrow donation the donor's disease was exacerbated with development of severe pulmonary alveolitis which required treatment with cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSIONS: When bone marrow transplantation was performed in a patient with AML with bone marrow from an HLA identical brother who had SLE, no evidence of transfer of disease was obtained. However, the recipient temporarily produced anti-C1q antibodies which was a characteristic feature of the donor's SLE and was probably produced by the transplant. The flare of the donor's SLE might be related to the bone marrow tap.","['Sturfelt, G', 'Lenhoff, S', 'Sallerfors, B', 'Nived, O', 'Truedsson, L', 'Sjoholm, A G']","['Sturfelt G', 'Lenhoff S', 'Sallerfors B', 'Nived O', 'Truedsson L', 'Sjoholm AG']","['Department of Rheumatology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoantibodies/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Complement C1q/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/ard.55.9.638 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 1996 Sep;55(9):638-41. doi: 10.1136/ard.55.9.638.,PMC1010261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 4-year event-free survival (EFS) estimates now exceed 85% in our current trials. Furthermore, high-dose methotrexate and intrathecal therapy could be substituted for cranial irradiation without an increase of central nervous system relapse rate. However, children with unfavorable presenting features (leukocyte counts > or = 50,000/microL; high-risk group) have a worse prognosis, although there is some improvement of outcome. The patients in the high-risk group have obtained the 4-year EFS rate of better than 60%. Further investigations of prognostic factors in ALL focused on the biological features may permit identification of groups of children at risk of very poor outcome.

The role of natural effector cells in radiation-induced leukemogenesis was investigated. Activity of natural killer (NK) and natural cytotoxic (NC) cells was depressed in irradiated mice over a prolonged period. Transplantation of bone marrow (BM) cells from normal C57 mice to irradiated mice restored their NK responses and prevented development of lymphoma. The effect of beige BM cell transfer to irradiated mice was not clear. Unlike short-term (4-hour) assay, results of long-term (20-hour) assay suggest partial restoration of NK and full restoration of NC activity in irradiated mice.

There is probably a direct or indirect interaction between PR and PML since when the latter was expressed at high concentrations it shifted PR into the nuclear bodies. Use of deletion mutants showed that both activation functions (AF1 and AF2) of PR as well as the coiled coil and His-Cys rich domains of PML were required for transcriptional enhancement. The fusion protein PML-RAR, which is not localized in nuclear bodies, also enhanced the transactivating activity of PR but this effect was totally suppressed by the administration of retinoic acid. PML, which is ubiquitously expressed, may thus be involved in the transactivation properties of steroid hormone receptors.

Prior to chemotherapy, cytogenetic studies on blood showed clonal rearrangements including t(7p;14q), T(2p;7q) and inv (7), while karyotype showed 6q- and 1p-mitoses on bone marrow blasts. Hypotonia became evident at 3 years. One year later, the neurological status deteriorated. The patient presented also severe respiratory tract infections. At that time, immunological investigations showed hypo IgG2, very low T4 lymphocytes level, all harbouring the CD45 RO phenotype. Increase in alpha-foetoprotein level, the ocular movements and the study of DNA synthesis after exposure to gamma-rays confirmed the diagnosis of AT. CONCLUSION: In cases of childhood lymphoid neoplasia, AT should be considered whenever parental consanguinity, T-cell proliferation and/or unexpected toxic therapeutic responses are noted.","['de Laet, C', 'Casimir, G', 'Duchateau, J', 'Vamos, E', 'Devalck, C', 'Sariban, E', 'Ferster, A']","['de Laet C', 'Casimir G', 'Duchateau J', 'Vamos E', 'Devalck C', 'Sariban E', 'Ferster A']","[""Unite d'hemato-oncologie, hopital universitaire des enfants Reine-Fabiola, Bruxelles, Belgique.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*diagnosis', 'Consanguinity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology', 'Thoracic Neoplasms/*etiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/05/05 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0929693X96870898 [pii]', '10.1016/0929-693x(96)87089-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 1996 Jul;3(7):681-4. doi: 10.1016/0929-693x(96)87089-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,Lymphome T leucemise comme premiere manifestation d'une ataxie-telangiectasie.,,,,,,

Notwithstanding its major action on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis, Mpl-L also potentiates the action of other cytokines on several hematopoietic lineages.

METHODS: The study included 226 men with HCL and 425 matched hospital referents. Pesticide exposure was assessed by expert review of detailed interview data on occupational histories and agricultural activities and exposures. RESULTS: Altogether, 77 cases and 116 referents had farmed for at least six months, giving an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-2.2]. Forage growing was reported by 20.8% of the cases and 11.1% of the referents and was associated with HCL (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-4.9), even among farmers who had never handled pesticides (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.0-11.0). A significant association was found between HCL and pesticide use, the overall odds ratios for insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide use ranging from 1.5 to 2.4. Organophosphorus insecticides were the only agrochemicals with a positive association with HCL after other pesticide exposures, smoking, and forage growing were accounted for. A clear-cut negative interaction was found between smoking and exposure to organophosphorus insecticides. A multivariate analysis yielded odds ratio estimates of 2.8 (95% CI 1.4-5.6) for exposure to forage and 7.5 (95% CI 0.9-61.5) for nonsmokers exposed to organophosphorus insecticides. CONCLUSIONS: The present study argues for a role of organophosphorus insecticides in HCL among nonsmoking farmers and shows an unexpected association with forage growing. No evidence of an association with phenoxyacetic acids, triazines, or organochlorine insecticides was found.","['Clavel, J', 'Hemon, D', 'Mandereau, L', 'Delemotte, B', 'Severin, F', 'Flandrin, G']","['Clavel J', 'Hemon D', 'Mandereau L', 'Delemotte B', 'Severin F', 'Flandrin G']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (National Institute of Health and Medical Research), INSERM U170, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Pesticides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology"", 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Insecticides/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Smoking/adverse effects/epidemiology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['143 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.143 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1996 Aug;22(4):285-93. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking into account the differential inhibition by x-rays of DNA synthesis in LY sublines and its reversion by BZ in LY-S but not in LY-R cells, we conclude that the pattern of DNA damage observed by the methods applied depended on the status of DNA replication.","['Gradzka, I', 'Iwanenko, T', 'Kruszewski, M', 'Szumiel, I', 'Kapiszewska, M', 'Lange, C S', 'Afanasjev, G']","['Gradzka I', 'Iwanenko T', 'Kruszewski M', 'Szumiel I', 'Kapiszewska M', 'Lange CS', 'Afanasjev G']","['Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Department of Radiobiology, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '6X80438640 (benzamide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004110050029 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1996 Aug;35(3):185-91. doi: 10.1007/s004110050029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR cell lines are resistant to the so-called naturally occurring anti-cancer drugs, such as anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins, but are not cross-resistant to alkylating agents, antimetabolites and cisplatin. So far, three separate forms of MDR have been characterized in more detail: classical MDR, non-Pgp MDR and atypical MDR. Although all three MDR phenotypes have much in common with respect to cross-resistance patterns, the underlying mechanisms certainly differ. Atypical MDR is associated with quantitative and qualitative alterations in topoisomerase II alpha, a nuclear enzyme that actively participates in the lethal action of cytotoxic drugs. Atypical MDR cells do not overexpress P-glycoprotein, and are unaltered in their ability to accumulate drugs. In this review we will focus on classical and non-Pgp MDR. The molecular mechanism of classical and non-Pgp MDR is transcriptional activation of membrane-bound transport proteins. These transport proteins belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport systems. The classical MDR phenotype is characterized by a reduced ability to accumulate drugs, due to activity of an energy-dependent uni-directional, membrane-bound, drug-efflux pump with broad substrate specificity. The classical MDR drug pump is composed of a transmembrane glycoprotein (P-glyco-protein-Pgp) with a molecular weight of 170 kD, and is, in man, encoded by the so-called multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene. Typically, non-Pgp MDR has no P-gly-coprotein expression, yet has about the same cross-resistance pattern as classical MDR. This non-Pgp MDR phenotype is caused by overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene, which encodes a 190 kD membrane-bound glycoprotein (MRP). MRP probably works by direct extrusion of cytotoxic drugs from the cell and/or by mediating sequestration of the drugs into intracellular compartments, both leading to a reduction in effective intracellular drug concentrations. For the classical MDR phenotype, evidence is accumulating that it plays a role indeed, in clinical drug resistance, especially in some hematological malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and solid tumors (soft tissue sarcomas and neuroblastoma). The association of MRP with clinical drug resistance has not been elaborated, yet, and studies on MRP expression in human cancer have just begun. We found that overexpression of MRP, as determined by RNase protection assay as well as by immunohistochemistry, occurs in several human cancers, among which are cancer of the lung, esophagus, breast and ovary, and leukemias. Further studies are indicated to establish whether elevated MRP expression at diagnosis is an unfavorable prognostic factor for clinical outcome of chemotherapy.","['Nooter, K', 'Stoter, G']","['Nooter K', 'Stoter G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Rotterdam Cancer Institute, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(96)80099-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(96)80099-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1996 Jul;192(7):768-80. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(96)80099-9.,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cytotoxic activity of free Dach-Pt(chlorato) was decreased by incubation in medium with serum, the OX-Dex/Dach-Pt conjugate kept its cytotoxic activity in higher level after 24 h incubation in medium with serum.

However, 20-30% of children with malignancies will succumb to their disease or complications associated with their disease or treatment. A major limiting factor to improvement in survival among these patients is the occurrence of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to our treatment interventions, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Among these mechanisms, multidrug resistance, the focus of this review, is a well-documented phenomenon whose biochemistry, pharmacology and molecular biology has been extensively studied. A role for multidrug resistance in chemoresistance and therapeutic failure in childhood malignancies is suggested by the observation of clinical resistance to treatment regimes containing agents that are known substrates of multidrug resistance mechanisms. With the current results from studies in rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, leukemia and retinoblastoma, the role of multidrug resistance is still unclear. Earlier studies attempted to define a role for P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance; however, a limited number of reports suggest that the multidrug-associated resistance protein may play an active role in neuroblastoma. Further studies will be necessary using standardized and uniform approaches for the analyses of these mechanisms. Clinical trials directed toward reversal of multidrug resistance are premature since the exact role of P-glycoprotein is controversial in pediatric malignancies, the role of other mechanisms of multidrug resistance must be assessed and selective inhibitors of multidrug resistance have yet to be developed.","['Kuttesch, J F Jr']",['Kuttesch JF Jr'],"['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D., Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00173683 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(1):55-67. doi: 10.1007/BF00173683.,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many advances in diagnosis have been made, dilemmas remain concerning the treatment of this disease. In primary extramedullary leukemia (EML) most reports agree upon a local therapy followed by systemic chemotherapy such as is used for ANLL. However, further prophylactic local or systemic therapy with stem cell support remains controversial. A 20-year-old patient was diagnosed as having granulocytic sarcoma (GS) of the uterus without evidence of ANLL in 1991. After resection of the tumor at the uterine cervix and chemotherapy with daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 (days 1-3) and cytosine-arabinoside 200 mg/m2 (days 1-7) in September 1991, complete remission was achieved. In October 1991 cytosine-arabinoside 1000 mg/m2 every 12 h from day 1 to day 6 and amsacrine 200 mg from day 5 to day 7 were given as consolidation. Two years later relapse occurred in the adnexae. After radical hysterectomy, the same induction and consolidation chemotherapy was administrated. Subsequently, cytoxane 60 mg/m2 and fractionated total body irradiation (6 x 200 cGy) were given as conditioning and the previously cryopreserved bone marrow was reinfused. Finally, after hematopoietic engraftment, prophylactic local irradiation (4500 cGy) to the pelvis was given resulting in a disease-free long-term survival of more than 36 months after relapse. Although this experience is confined to one patient, it may contribute to the design of prospective therapeutic studies in patients with primary EML.","['Huter, O', 'Brezinka, C', 'Nachbaur, D', 'Schwaighofer, H', 'Lang, A', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Huter O', 'Brezinka C', 'Nachbaur D', 'Schwaighofer H', 'Lang A', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Innsbruck University Hospital, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Pelvis/radiation effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*therapy']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Sep;18(3):663-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The indications for transplant in the combined group of 27 patients were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 14 cases (52%), acute myeloid leukaemia in 11 cases (41%) and aplastic anemia in two cases (7%). Transplants were autologous in five cases (19%) and allogeneic in 22 cases (81%); of the 22 allogeneic transplants, 16 donors were HLA-matched siblings. In all patients the conditioning regimen included total body irradiation of 7.5 Gy or more, and/or contained cyclophosphamide of 120 mg/kg or more. Seven patients (26%) had fatal pulmonary disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage. Five patients (19%) had significant airway problems including three with severe mucositis who required intubation for airway protection, one with severe mucositis with partial airway obstruction that required observation in the intensive care unit but did not require intubation, and one with Candida albicans laryngitis with development of a glottic web. Nineteen patients (70%) survived beyond 100 days post-transplant. There was no clear association between 100-day survival and the use of any particular agent or regimen used for conditioning or graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and the majority of patients tolerated high-dose cyclophosphamide, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, high-dose busulfan, total body irradiation, cyclosporin A, and methotrexate. There appeared to be more early deaths in patients who received the combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, compared with those receiving the combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide or those receiving the combination of cytosine arabinoside and total body irradiation. Also, the use of methotrexate was associated with a greater number of early deaths, compared with cyclosporin A. At 3 years, life table estimates of freedom from relapse, relapse-free survival and survival were 75%, 44% and 48%, respectively. The estimated cumulative risk of death due to a non-leukaemic cause at 3 years was 39%. The data show that Down syndrome patients can tolerate the commonly used transplant conditioning regimens with acceptable toxicity; however, there is a strong suggestion in the data that the rates of life-threatening and fatal toxicity are higher than would be expected to occur in patients without Down's syndrome.

Ten patients with relapsed or persistent leukemia after BMT received intensive cytotoxic conditioning followed by allogeneic BCT. Three BCT were from single-antigen mismatched donors; two of the corresponding recipients had rejected a BMT from the same donor. Two patients received BCT from a different donor (one matched, one single-antigen mismatched). The other six BCT were from the same, fully matched, bone marrow donors. Donors were given G-CSF to mobilize progenitor cells which were collected by a single 2-4 h leukapheresis. Methotrexate, CsA and folinic acid were used for GVHD prophylaxis for all transplants but CsA was discontinued sooner after BCT than after BMT. One patient died without engraftment having rejected a BMT from the same single-antigen mismatched donor 4 years previously. Nine patients had granulocyte recovery at a median of 14 days, up to 6 days faster than with their previous BMT. Platelet recovery was also 2-6 days faster than with BMT in four previously engrafting patients. Four patients died without platelet recovery after BCT within a year of BMT, three of treatment-related toxicity and one of relapse. Two patients developed grade II acute GVHD. Of six patients given BCT more than a year from BMT, four, all with acute leukemia, survive 7, 14, 29 and 29 months after BCT and one relapsed at 7 months. All four survivors developed chronic GVHD.

We report our experience using a chemotherapy conditioning regimen (busulfan (Bu), cyclophosphamide (CY) and melphalan (Mel)) in 26 consecutively enrolled children with ALL (group I). At a median follow-up of 58 months, event-free survival (EFS) for Bu/CY/Mel-treated patients was 27% (+/- 8.7), while the leukemic relapse rate was 49% (+/- 13). Regimen-related toxicity was severe in these patients: overall treatment-related mortality was 42%, while 50% of patients had interstitial pneumonitis and 35% of patients had severe hemorrhagic cystitis.

Moreover, natural T cells in TAP-1o/o mice are numerically expanded. Several H-2 class Ib molecules function in a TAP-independent manner, suggesting that if expressed in TAP-1o/o thymocytes, they could play a role in natural T cell development. Of these class Ib molecules, H-2TL is expressed by TAP-1o/o thymocytes. Moreover, we find that thymi of TL+ mice congenic or transgenic for H-2T18 also have a numerically expanded natural T cell repertoire compared with TL- mice. This expansion, as in TAP-1o/o thymi, is evident in each of the limited T cell receptor V beta chains expressed by natural T cells, suggesting that TL and CD1d impact similar repertoires.

Because of its cytokine synthesis-inhibiting action, interleukin 10 (IL-10) could be a potentially useful molecule to affect leukemic cell growth in such disorders. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cells spontaneously form myeloid colonies (colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage) in methylcellulose, suggesting an autocrine growth factor-mediated mechanism. We studied the effect of recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10) on the in vitro growth of mononuclear cells obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow of patients with CMML. IL-10 specifically binding to leukemic cells had a profound and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on autonomous in vitro growth of CMML cells. IL-10 significantly inhibited the spontaneous growth of myeloid colonies in methylcellulose in 10/11 patients, and autonomous CMML cell growth in suspension in 5/5 patients tested. Spontaneous colony growth from CMML cells was also markedly reduced by addition of antigranulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies, but not by addition of antibodies against G-CSF, IL-3, or IL-6, IL-10-induced suppression of CMML cell growth was reversed by the addition of exogenous GM-CSF and correlated with a substantial decrease in GM-CSF production by leukemic cells, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our data indicate that IL-10 profoundly inhibits the autonomous growth of CMML cells in vitro most likely through suppression of endogenous GM-CSF release.

There is a need for epitope-specific antisera to distinguish the mCAT2/2A proteins and reagents that will specifically block transport to each of these proteins.

Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was abolished whereas botrocetin-mediated aggregation was normal. Multimeric analysis of vWF from patient's plasma showed that larger sizes of multimers were reduced. His past and family histories were negative for bleeding tendency. These results suggested that acquired type 2 vWD was present during his clinical course. The inhibitor was purified by Staphylococcal protein A, suggesting an IgG antibody. Both binding of 125I-vWF to GPIb and platelet agglutination by ristocetin were inhibited by the patient IgG with the concentrations of competing substances necessary to inhibit specific binding by 50% (IC50s) of 260 micrograms/ml and 420 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, the IgG had no effect on these studies mediated by botrocetin. The IgG only reacted with intact vWF and a 39/34 kDa fragment of vWF.

Because the response of blast stem cells in culture to growth factors might influence the contribution of factor to clinical outcome, we studied 42 patients with AML or severe myelodysplasia. Peripheral blood blast cells were cultured in a clonogenic assay at three cell concentrations and with the following combinations of growth factors: no added growth factor (NF), G-CSF, GM-CSF, Kit ligand (KL), G-CSF + KL, GM-CSF + KL, and G-CSF + GM-CSF + KL. The slope of the line relating cell number plated to colony formation was calculated by least squares. The slopes were used to form three equally sized groups of patients. Marked heterogeneity was found in response of the blast populations to factor. A few general conclusions emerged: (1) autonomous blast populations are very rare; (2) although usually a population responds better to one of the growth factors than to others, seldom is the response exclusively to one factor; (3) when more than one factor is included in the cultures, synergism is usually seen. Significant associations were seen between successful remission induction for low slope values in cultures with NF or KL alone. For remission, but not survival, associations were found with intermediate values of slope in cultures with G-CSF + KL and GM-CSF + KL.

However, when AZT therapy was delayed until 96 h p.i., both continuous infusion and intermittent injection gave complete protection. The results suggest that intermittent AZT administration is less efficacious than continuous infusion. Higher peak AZT concentrations in plasma associated with intermittent injection compared with those associated with continuous infusion may be immunotoxic, thus reducing the drug-induced vaccine effect.

Thirty-six patients lacked detectable oncogene rearrangements. Genomic DNA was isolated from involved tissues or leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and/or at relapse, and established cell lines. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were performed to analyze abnormalities of the p53 gene. We detected p53 gene alterations in 18 of 128 patients, representing 21 of the total 151 materials analyzed. In the total of 66 patients with an oncogene rearrangement studied at diagnosis, only one had a mutation; however, 6 of 37 patients studied at relapse showed p53 mutations. Sequential analysis revealed that the p53 mutation was closely associated with transformation from follicular lymphoma to large cell lymphoma, exclusively in BCL2-positive lymphoma cases. Two of 13 mutations observed in oncogene rearrangement-positive cases and cell lines were transitions at CpG dinucleotides.

In the present study, we have succeeded in serial transplantation of ATL cells from a patient into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. In this model, we found that only a leukemic cell clone from an ATL patient could be successively transplanted into SCID mice, although it was difficult to maintain leukemic cell clones in vitro, suggesting that the microenvironment provided by SCID mice is suitable for leukemic cell growth. We could not detect human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) mRNA or interleukin 2 (IL-2) mRNA in either the tumor cells growing in mice or the original leukemic cells. Thus, it appears that neither HTLV-I viral expression nor the IL-2 autocrine mechanism is directly involved in the neoplastic cell growth of fresh ATL cells as well as HTLV-I-infected cell lines, at least in SCID mice. In addition, we could passage frozen cells and obtain a large number of expanded leukemic cells in this model. Such a serial transplantation model, which can avoid the changes in the nature of leukemic cells that are frequently observed in in vitro culture, and which can propagate leukemic cell clones, would be very suitable not only to study the mechanism of neoplastic cell growth, but also to test potential therapeutic agents for ATL.","['Imada, K', 'Takaori-Kondo, A', 'Sawada, H', 'Imura, A', 'Kawamata, S', 'Okuma, M', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Imada K', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Sawada H', 'Imura A', 'Kawamata S', 'Okuma M', 'Uchiyama T']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096858935 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb02116.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Sep;87(9):887-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb02116.x.,PMC5921197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-10 may act as an autocrine growth factor for the expansion of malignant B-1 cells. In order to determine if elevated endogenous production of IL-10 was a required element for the malignant transformation of B-1 cells in NZB mice, backcross animals were studied for the linkage between elevated IL-10 expression and the presence of lymphoid malignancy. The phenotypes of aged (NZB x DBA/2)F1 x NZB animals were determined and a strong correlation was found between the elevated levels of IL-10 mRNA and the development of B-1 malignant clones. In contrast, an increased level of IL-10 message was not associated with elevated serum IgM or the presence of anemia or reticulocytosis which is mainly seen in response to autoantibody production. These results indicate that, at least in NZB, the autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation phenotypes are not linked genetically. IL-10 may enhance proliferation and the development of B-1 cell malignancy rather than antibody production by the B-1 cell subpopulation. Thus, IL-10 plays an important role in B-1 malignancies, and downregulation of IL-10 could be a likely site for intervention in B cell malignancies.","['Ramachandra, S', 'Metcalf, R A', 'Fredrickson, T', 'Marti, G E', 'Raveche, E']","['Ramachandra S', 'Metcalf RA', 'Fredrickson T', 'Marti GE', 'Raveche E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Oct 15;98(8):1788-93. doi: 10.1172/JCI118978.,PMC507617,,['CA-71478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been shown to be of diagnostic utility in distinguishing between small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), two entities that can have similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features. Such studies, however, generally required viable cells in cell suspension or cryostat sections for detection of CD23. We evaluated staining for the CD23 antigen in paraffin sections, using BU38, an antibody that detects a fixation-resistant epitope of the antigen. We analyzed 44 SLLs, 3 lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas, and 39 MCLs. Staining was performed on formalin- or B5-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using L26 (CD20), CD3, Leu22 (CD43), and BU38 (CD23) antibodies. All of the cases were of B-cell phenotype (CD20+), and 42/44 SLLs, 3/3 lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas, and 33/39 MCLs coexpressed the CD43 antigen. CD23 was positive in 41 (93%) of 44 SLLs. The majority of neoplastic cells (75% or more) stained positively, with a membranous pattern of staining. The staining was moderate in intensity and easily interpreted. Only 1/39 MCLs and 1/3 lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas were CD23 positive. CD23-positive follicular dendritic cells were, however, present in all of the MCLs, either in residual follicles or in large, disordered meshworks.

Potencies of various intact and sugar-trimmed rhEpo preparations were estimated using the International Standard for Human r-DNA-derived Epo (87/684) as a reference for activity. The cellular response was measured in a multi-channel photometer using a colorimetric microassay, based on the metabolism of the tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan, by viable cells. The linear part of the log dose-response relationship encompassed 2.5-90 pM and activity of rhEpo preparations was measured at doses between 3 and 60 pM. The assay was designed as a parallel line test, using three or four concentrations for potency determinations, which fulfills pharmacopoeial requirements for assay validity. Inter-assay relative standard deviation varied between 4.1% and 12.6% and most assays revealed potencies with limits of error within 87-113%. In order to acquire an additional means for an efficient probing of physiologically relevant features of rhEpo, a luminiscence-dependent Western detection system, based on a combined isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation, was established. As opposed to conventional electrophoresis the two dimensional approach enabled the disclosure of minor truncations in the rhEpo-attached glycan moieties using picomolar quantities of the hormone. Moreover, the separated isoforms of rhEpo were quantified by computer-assisted densitometry and compared with the 87/684 standard. Accordingly, results obtained by the cellular response were balanced against the general pattern observed and the relative amounts of separated rhEpo isomers as determined by the quantitative Western analysis. The method described should be suitable for potency assessments of pharmaceutical formulations of rhEpo.","['Hammerling, U', 'Kroon, R', 'Wilhelmsen, T', 'Sjodin, L']","['Hammerling U', 'Kroon R', 'Wilhelmsen T', 'Sjodin L']","['Division of Biotechnology, Medical Products Agency, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Erythropoietin/*analysis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/analysis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0731708596017992 [pii]', '10.1016/0731-7085(96)01799-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 1996 Aug;14(11):1455-69. doi: 10.1016/0731-7085(96)01799-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLA cells are characterized by the constitutive expression of intermediate affinity receptors for IL-2, together with IL-4 receptors. MLA-144 cells secrete IL-2 and are insensitive to dexamethasone, whereas MLA-E7T cells do not constitutively produce significant amounts of IL-2 and undergo apoptotic cell death in the presence of dexamethasone. Exogenous IL-2 was shown to protect MLA-E7T cells against the apoptotic effect of dexamethasone and to increase both the DNA binding and transactivating functions of activator protein-1 (AP-1). The functional relationship between AP-1 and glucocorticoid receptors transcriptional activities was further investigated using transient expression of reporter gene constructs whose transcriptions are regulated by promoters containing TPA-responsive elements or glucocorticoid-responsive elements. The data reported here demonstrate that in MLA-144 cells, IL-2 or PMA stimulation antagonizes the glucocorticoid receptor, whereas in MLA-E7T, synergistic effects are observed between dexamethasone and IL-2 or PMA for transactivation of MMTV-CAT. Taken together with the finding that IL-2 but not PMA protects MLA-E7T from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, our results indicate that IL-2 does not induce such a protection by repressing the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor.","['Guizani, L', 'Perrin-Wolff, M', 'Breard, J', 'Binetruy, B', 'Bertoglio, J']","['Guizani L', 'Perrin-Wolff M', 'Breard J', 'Binetruy B', 'Bertoglio J']","['CJF INSERM 93-01, Faculte de Pharmacie-Paris XI, Chatenay Malabry, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dexamethasone/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1996.16.601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996 Aug;16(8):601-9. doi: 10.1089/jir.1996.16.601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little information about the molecular basis for the constitutive repression of IL-2 and IL-4 gene expression in unstimulated T cells. We investigated the possibility that wild-type (wt) p53, a nuclear tumor suppressor protein, might serve to repress IL-2 and IL-4 gene expression in murine E14 T lymphoma and in human Jurkat cells. We transiently cotransfected these cells with constitutive simian virus 40 (SV 40) early promoter expression plasmids overproducing wt or mutant murine p53 and with appropriate luciferase (luc) reporter plasmids containing the promoter elements of murine IL-2 and IL-4 genes to evaluate the effect of various p53 species on these promoters. Murine wt p53 derived from pSG5p53cD strongly repressed the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters in both cell lines induced by the phorbol ester TPA and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin but not, however, in uninduced cells. In similar transient transfection experiments with lymphoma cells, overexpression of deletion mutant species of murine p53 revealed that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are crucial for inhibition of both IL-2 and IL-4 gene expression. These parts of p53 comprise the transactivation domain at the amino terminal side, which has previously also been shown to interact with the TATA-box binding-protein TBP and the carboxy-terminal oligomerization domain. Additionally, it was shown that a previously described inhibitory protein, the high-mobility-group protein HMG-I/Y, does not functionally interact with p53. Cotransfection of expression plasmids for both p53 and HMG-I/Y did not alter the extent of inhibition by the individual proteins. These data suggest that p53 can downmodulate both IL-2 and IL-4 gene expression and that both the transactivation and oligomerization domains of the tumor suppressor protein are essential for this transcriptional repression.","['Pesch, J', 'Brehm, U', 'Staib, C', 'Grummt, F']","['Pesch J', 'Brehm U', 'Staib C', 'Grummt F']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'HMGA1a Protein', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1996.16.595 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996 Aug;16(8):595-600. doi: 10.1089/jir.1996.16.595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress in this area needs elaboration of defined culture and transduction conditions for long-term repopulating cells and improvement of gene transfer systems. We have optimized retroviral vector constructions based on murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) to overcome the transcriptional repression encountered with the use of conventional Moloney MuLV (MoMuLV) vectors in early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Novel retroviral vectors, termed FMEV (for Friend-MCF/MESV hybrid vectors), were cloned that mediate greatly improved gene expression in the myeloerythroid compartment. Transfer of the selectable marker multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1), FMEV, in contrast to conventional MoMuLV-related vectors currently in use for clinical protocols, mediated background-free selectability of transduced human HPC in the presence of myeloablative doses of the cytostatic agent paclitaxel in vitro. Furthermore, FMEV also greatly improved chemo-protection of hematopoietic progenitor cells in a murine model system in vivo. Finally, when a second gene was transferred along with mdr1 in an FMEV-backbone, close to 100% coexpression was observed in multidrug-resistant colonies. These observations have significant consequences for a number of ongoing and planned gene therapy trials, for example, stem cell protection to reduce the myelotoxic side effects of anticancer chemotherapy, correction of inherited disorders involving hematopoietic cells, and antagonism of HIV infection.","['Baum, C', 'Eckert, H G', 'Stockschlader, M', 'Just, U', 'Hegewisch-Becker, S', 'Hildinger, M', 'Uhde, A', 'John, J', 'Ostertag, W']","['Baum C', 'Eckert HG', 'Stockschlader M', 'Just U', 'Hegewisch-Becker S', 'Hildinger M', 'Uhde A', 'John J', 'Ostertag W']","['Abteilung Zell- und Virusgenetik, Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, MDR', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Safety', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.323 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1996 Aug;5(4):323-9. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.323.,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since adhesion molecules play a key role in metastasis, we evaluated how the expression of adhesion molecules is influenced by hyperthermia. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated in vitro for 1 h. at 39, 42, 43 and 44 degrees C with and without addition of tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the expression of endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II molecule was measured. Expression of MHC class-II molecules and expression of unstimulated constituent ICAM-1's was not reduced by heat treatment. In contrast, expression of cytokine-induced ELAM-1's and ICAM-1's was significantly lower after heat treatment. The adhesion to HUVEC in vitro of HL-60 leukemia cells, which express sialyl-Lewis-x antigen as a ligand to ELAM-1, was diminished after incubation at 42 degrees C and totally lost after treatment at 44 degrees C. This suggests that any decrease in metastasis formation after heat treatment, which is occasionally observed, could be due to a reduced action of TNF or related cytokines on adhesion molecule induction and subsequent membrane expression by the endothelial cell. A possible underlying mechanism involved is a heat-induced alteration or blockage of the biosynthetic pathways required for synthesis of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 proteins.","['Brand, K', 'Lubbe, A S', 'Justus, D J']","['Brand K', 'Lubbe AS', 'Justus DJ']","['Center of Applied Microcirculatory Research, University of Louisville, School of Medicine, KY 40292, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin/*biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02656739609023529 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 1996 Jul-Aug;12(4):527-38. doi: 10.3109/02656739609023529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of cells with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (DMP) or dithiothreitol (DTT), compounds containing sulfhydryls, prevented PAO-stimulated [3H]PBut formation, indicating that PAO-stimulated PLD through interacting with vicinal thiol groups. Treatment of cells with PAO resulted in increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration without significant production of inositol phosphates. Removal of extracellular free Ca2+ by chelating with EGTA was found to inhibit [3H]PBut formation by PAO. Incubation of cells with 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 6 h caused down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta isozymes, whereas it had no effect on PKC delta, epsilon and zeta isozymes. Under this condition, decrease in PAO-stimulated [3H]PBut formation was observed to occur with a concomitant decrease in the level of PKC alpha and beta isozymes. These results suggest that a covalent bridge between vicinal thiol groups of cell surface proteins induced by PAO potentiates PLD activation and that PAO-induced PLD activation is regulated by Ca2+ and PKC alpha and/or beta isozymes.","['Kumada, T', 'Nakashima, S', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Miyata, H', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Kumada T', 'Nakashima S', 'Nakamura Y', 'Miyata H', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0CPP32S55X (Dimercaprol)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Dimercaprol/pharmacology', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Phospholipase D/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(96)80051-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(96)80051-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1996 Aug;195(3):347-59. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(96)80051-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since a fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) is known to interfere with ARF function, the effect of BFA on antigen-induced PLD activation was examined in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. BFA inhibited the antigen-induced formation of phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), a specific and stable metabolite produced by PLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibition obtained at 10 micrograms/ml of the drug was nearly 70% and further inhibition was not observed at higher concentrations. Ca(2+)-ionophore A23187-mediated PLD activation was also prevented by BFA. In contrast, BFA failed to inhibit PLD activation in response to 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). This indicates that there are BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive pathways leading to PLD activation in RBL-2H3 cells and also that the PKC-mediated pathway may be insensitive to BFA treatment, suggesting the existence of PLD isozymes. BFA inhibited Ag-induced serotonin release at a concentration 20-fold lower than that needed for the inhibition of PLD. Moreover, PMA caused a marked production of PBut, but it failed to elicit secretory response. This implies that PLD may be not a crucial element for secretory responses.","['Nakamura, Y', 'Nakashima, S', 'Kumada, T', 'Ojio, K', 'Miyata, H', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nakamura Y', 'Nakashima S', 'Kumada T', 'Ojio K', 'Miyata H', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*drug effects/immunology', 'Brefeldin A', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*enzymology', 'Phospholipase D/*antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(96)80042-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(96)80042-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1996 Jul;195(2):231-42. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(96)80042-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of such studies, the fact that low IgE concentrations are capable of inducing powerful effector function has encouraged the view that IgE antibodies are typically high affinity antibodies. Yet the phenomenon of allergic cross-reactivity suggests that lower affinity IgE antibodies may sometimes be of clinical significance. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of antibody affinity upon mast cell sensitivity in an in vitro model. METHODS: Rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells were sensitized with one of three monoclonal IgE antibodies which bind to trinitrophenylated proteins with varying affinity. Serotonin release was measured after challenge of sensitized cells with trinitrophenylated human serum albumin (TNP-HSA). RESULTS: Low valency TNP3-HSA failed to stimulate degranulation of RBL cells sensitized with SPE-7 anti-DNP IgE, which binds TNP with low affinity. However, upon challenge with high concentrations (1250 ng/mL) of TNP8-HSA, or as little as 10 ng/mL of highly substituted TNP23-HSA, low levels of degranulation were seen. A similar relationship between antigen valency and cell sensitivity was seen with cells sensitized with the H-l epsilon-DNP anti-DNP IgE, which binds with moderate affinity to TNP proteins. CONCLUSION: High valency antigen is capable of activating RBL cells sensitized with low affinity antibody. This has important implications for our understanding of allergic sensitization. It also suggests that the long-recognized relationship between antigen valency and RBL cell sensitivity may partly reflect the high functional affinity of cell-bound IgE when directed against multivalent antigen.","['Collins, A M', 'Basil, M', 'Nguyen, K', 'Thelian, D']","['Collins AM', 'Basil M', 'Nguyen K', 'Thelian D']","['School of Microbiology and Immunology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Picrates)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'A49OS0F91S (picric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody Affinity', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Histamine Release', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin E/*chemistry/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology', 'Picrates/immunology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 1996 Aug;26(8):964-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of the present study were (i) to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), coronavirus (FCoV), parvovirus (FPV), and immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen in 311 serum samples collected between 1984 and 1991 from lions inhabiting Tanzania's national parks and (ii) to evaluate the possible biological importance and the interrelationship of these viral infections. Antibodies to FCV, never reported previously in free-ranging lions, were detected in 70% of the sera. In addition, a much higher prevalence of antibodies to FCoV (57%) was found than was previously reported in Etosha National Park and Kruger National Park. Titers ranged from 25 to 400. FeLV antigen was not detectable in any of the serum samples. FCoV, FCV, FHV, and FIV were endemic in the Serengeti, while a transient elevation of FPV titers pointed to an outbreak of FPV infection between 1985 and 1987. Antibody titers to FPV and FCV were highly prevalent in the Serengeti (FPV, 75%; FCV, 67%) but not in Ngorongoro Crater (FPV, 27%; FCV, 2%). These differences could be explained by the different habitats and biological histories of the two populations and by the well-documented absence of immigration of lions from the Serengeti plains into Ngorongoro Crater after 1965. These observations indicate that, although the pathological potential of these viral infections seemed not to be very high in free-ranging lions, relocation of seropositive animals by humans to seronegative lion populations must be considered very carefully.","['Hofmann-Lehmann, R', 'Fehr, D', 'Grob, M', 'Elgizoli, M', 'Packer, C', 'Martenson, J S', ""O'Brien, S J"", 'Lutz, H']","['Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Fehr D', 'Grob M', 'Elgizoli M', 'Packer C', 'Martenson JS', ""O'Brien SJ"", 'Lutz H']","['Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland. rhofmann@vetklinik.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,9421292,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Africa, Eastern/epidemiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Calicivirus, Feline/*immunology', 'Coronavirus/*immunology', 'Coronavirus, Feline/immunology', 'Feline Panleukopenia Virus/*immunology', 'Herpesviridae/*immunology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Lions']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/cdli.3.5.554-562.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1996 Sep;3(5):554-62. doi: 10.1128/cdli.3.5.554-562.1996.,PMC170405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a pilot cross-sectional study to assess four candidate biomarkers of immune activation. beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine levels were assayed in stored sera from asymptomatic, human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTL V-I)-seronegative (HTLV-I-) and HTLV-I-seropositive (HTLV-I+) individuals, and ATL and HAM/TSP patients previously enrolled in seroepidemiological studies in Jamaica.

No significant differences in biomarkers were found between the HTLV-I- and HTLV-I+ groups. Among HAM/TSP patients, a significant association was found between elevated neopterin levels and symptoms of less than 4 years duration. In Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, neopterin and tryptophan were found to be independent predictors of survival among ATL patients.

Since infants who develop leukemia are likely to have had at least one transforming event occur in utero, we hypothesize that high levels of IGF-1 may both produce a larger baby and contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Ross, J A', 'Perentesis, J P', 'Robison, L L', 'Davies, S M']","['Ross JA', 'Perentesis JP', 'Robison LL', 'Davies SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)'],IM,"['*Birth Weight', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis/*physiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Risk Factors']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00051889 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1996 Sep;7(5):553-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00051889.,,66,['T32 CA09607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the aim was to explore the variation in risk connected with cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking of suspected smoking-associated cancers other than lung cancer. Data were obtained from a survey of a random sample of the Norwegian population. A self-administered mailed questionnaire, which included questions about smoking habits, was completed by 26,000 men and women in 1965 (response rate: 76 percent). The cohort was followed from 1966 through 1993, including registration of all incident cancer cases. A dose-response relationship of cigarette smoking to the risk of urinary bladder cancer and cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract was observed. For the latter forms of cancer, a dose-response relationship of pipe smoking also was observed. In cancer of the pancreas, a stronger association between cigarette smoking and cancer risk was observed when the analysis was confined to histologically confirmed cases only. Current cigarette smokers at baseline had a significantly higher risk of cervical cancer than those who never smoked cigarettes. In cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, breast, corpus uteri, ovary, and prostate, and in leukemia, no association between smoking and cancer risk was observed.","['Engeland, A', 'Andersen, A', 'Haldorsen, T', 'Tretli, S']","['Engeland A', 'Andersen A', 'Haldorsen T', 'Tretli S']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Institute for Epidemiological Cancer Research, Montebello, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Rectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*epidemiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00051881 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1996 Sep;7(5):497-506. doi: 10.1007/BF00051881.,,,['PH-64-499/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the purposes of radiological protection, it is assumed that low doses of radiation confer a small increased risk of cancer upon the exposed individual and this is a major consideration in setting dose limits for workers and the general public. Quantitative estimates of radiation risk have been derived from epidemiological studies of groups exposed, on average, to high or moderate doses of radiation (such as the Japanese atomic bomb survivors), and appropriate assumptions are made for the application of such estimates to low dose conditions. There have been claims that the risks of cancer in nuclear industry workers, in their children, and in populations living around nuclear facilities have been grossly underestimated. Substantial evidence is now available from the epidemiological study of these groups. Studies of nuclear industry workforces demonstrate that currently accepted risk estimates are at about the right level, although a positive trend of leukaemia mortality with radiation dose, of a magnitude which is compatible with predictions, can be detected in the most statistically powerful workforce studies. The hypothesis that irradiation of fathers before the conception of their children materially increases the risk of childhood leukaemia has been largely discounted since it is biologically implausible and has found no support in studies using data independent of the study which generated the hypothesis. Increased levels of childhood leukaemia have occurred near certain nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, but it is most unlikely that these are related to exposure to ionising radiation. Recent evidence suggests that these excesses are caused by a rare response to an infectious agent, which is enhanced under the unusual conditions of population mixing found in these communities. Similar excesses of childhood leukaemia have been found in other communities which have experienced unusual population mixing, but are not near nuclear facilities.","['Wakeford, R', 'Berry, R J']","['Wakeford R', 'Berry RJ']","['British Nuclear Fuels plc, Cheshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Child', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fathers', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Population', '*Power Plants', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1996 May;25(3):468-76.,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study followed 943 workers with at least 1 year of cumulative employment at the Monsanto plant in Muscatine, Iowa, from startup of the alachlor manufacturing process in March 1968 through December 1990. Approximately 96% of all workers were successfully traced to determine their last known residence and cancer status. Eighteen workers were diagnosed with cancer during the follow-up period, based on pathology information from the statewide cancer registry maintained by the State Health Registry of Iowa. The standardized incidence ratio for all cancers was 1.5 (95% CI 0.9-2.4) for all workers exposed to alachlor, which was due primarily to elevated rates for colorectal cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. Workers with 5 or more years in estimated high alachlor exposure jobs had elevated rates of colorectal cancer (3 cases, SIR = 5.2, 95% CI 1.1-15.1). Interpretation of the study results is limited by the small size of the study population, minimal length of follow-up, and current information concerning alachlor metabolism in primates and humans.

The highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique may be applicable to cases of leukemia and lymphoma of non-T-cell origin for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). A PCR technique was used in this study to investigate the pattern of clonal TCR delta gene rearrangement in Hong Kong Chinese patients with non-T-cell hematological malignancies. Seventy-three patients with the diagnosis of acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of non-T-cell origin were included in this study. There were 20 patients with common ALL (cALL), seven precursal B-cell ALL (PreB-ALL), 23 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 23 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-lineage (B-NHL). Clonal rearrangement was detectable by Southern analysis using a J delta 1 probe in 41 per cent of ALL of B-lineage but in none of the B-NHL or AML. The samples were also studied further by monoclonal PCR amplification for TCR delta gene rearrangement. Three different sets of primers were employed to detect clonal rearrangement of the TCR delta gene. The V delta 1(D)J delta 1 recombination typically seen in T-cell malignancies were not seen in any of the of the non-T-cell malignancies. The V delta 2 (D) D delta 3 recombination was found exclusively in ALL of B-lineage and was seen in 73 per cent of the Southern positive cases. Although clonal TCR delta gene rearrangement was undetectable by Southern analysis in our AML cases, 26 per cent had a V delta 2(D)J delta 1 recombination found by the PCR technique. Sensitivity of the PCR technique was determined by serial mixing and was up to 5-10 leukemic cells per 10(4) nucleated cells. It was apparent from this study that it was feasible to detect clonal TCR delta gene rearrangement by the PCR technique in a proportion of the cases of non-T-cell hematological malignancies.

The mechanism by which AML1-ETO accomplishes leukemic transformation is unknown; however, AML1-ETO interferes with AML1 transactivation of such AML1 targets as the T-cell receptor beta enhancer and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter. Herein, we explored the effect of AML1-ETO on regulation of a myeloid-specific AML1 target, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor promoter. We found that AML1-ETO and AML1 work synergistically to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter, thus exhibiting a different activity than previously described. Truncation mutants within the ETO portion of AML1-ETO revealed the region of ETO necessary for the cooperativity between AML1 and AML1-ETO lies between amino acids 347 and 540. Endogenous M-CSF receptor expression was examined in Kasumi-1 cells, derived from a patient with AML-M2 t(8;21) and the promonocytic cell line U937. Kasumi-1 cells exhibited a significantly higher level of M-CSF receptor expression than U937 cells. Bone marrow from patients with AML-M2 t(8;21) also exhibited a higher level of expression of M-CSF receptor compared with normal controls. The upregulation of M-CSF receptor expression by AML1-ETO may contribute to the development of a leukemic state in these patients.","['Rhoades, K L', 'Hetherington, C J', 'Rowley, J D', 'Hiebert, S W', 'Nucifora, G', 'Tenen, D G', 'Zhang, D E']","['Rhoades KL', 'Hetherington CJ', 'Rowley JD', 'Hiebert SW', 'Nucifora G', 'Tenen DG', 'Zhang DE']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.21.11895 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 15;93(21):11895-900. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.21.11895.,PMC38155,,"['CA1AI59589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68727-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have analyzed tumors from 43 patients with LPD (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, n = 40; mantle cell lymphoma, n = 3) showing aberrations of bands 11q21-923 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. As probes we used Alu-PCR products from 17 yeast artificial chromosome clones spanning chromosome bands 11q14.3-923.3, including a panel of yeast artificial chromosome clones recognizing a contiguous genomic DNA fragment of approximately 9-10 Mb in bands 11q22.3-923.3. In the 41 tumors exhibiting deletions, we identified a commonly deleted segment in band 11q22.3-923.1; this region is approximately 2-3 Mb in size and contains the genes coding for ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), RDX (radixin), and FDX1 (ferredoxin 1). Furthermore, two translocation break-points were localized to a 1.8-Mb genomic fragment contained within the commonly deleted segment. Thus, we have identified a single critical region of 2-3 Mb in size in which 11q14-923 aberrations in LPD cluster.

We report the structure-function analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta 3 (glycoprotein IIla) based on the cellular import of synthetic peptide analogs of this region. Among the four overlapping cell-permeable peptides, only the peptide carrying residues 747-762 of the carboxyl-terminal segment of integrin beta 3 inhibited adhesion of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells and of human endothelial cells (ECV) 304 to immobilized fibrinogen mediated by integrin beta 3 heterodimers, alpha IIb beta 3, and alpha v beta 3, respectively. Inhibition of adhesion was integrin-specific because the cell-permeable beta 3 peptide (residues 747-762) did not inhibit adhesion of human fibroblasts mediated by integrin beta 1 heterodimers. Conversely, a cell-permeable peptide representing homologous portion of the integrin beta 1 cytoplasmic tail (residues 788-803) inhibited adhesion of human fibroblasts, whereas it was without effect on adhesion of HEL or ECV 304 cells. The cell-permeable integrin beta 3 peptide (residues 747-762) carrying a known loss-of-function mutation (Ser752Pro) responsible for the genetic disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia Paris I did not inhibit cell adhesion of HEL or ECV 304 cells, whereas the beta 3 peptide carrying a Ser752Ala mutation was inhibitory. Although Ser752 is not essential, Tyr747 and Tyr759 form a functionally active tandem because conservative mutations Tyr747Phe or Tyr759Phe resulted in a nonfunctional cell permeable integrin beta 3 peptide. We propose that the carboxyl-terminal segment of the integrin beta 3 cytoplasmic tail spanning residues 747-762 constitutes a major intracellular cell adhesion regulatory domain (CARD) that modulates the interaction of integrin beta 3-expressing cells with immobilized fibrinogen.

We now examine the dynamics of this process for the imprinted gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2). In young individuals, the P2-4 promoters of IGF2 are methylated exclusively on the silenced maternal allele. During aging, this promoter methylation becomes more extensive and involves the originally unmethylated allele. Most adult human tumors, including colon, breast, lung, and leukemias, exhibit increased methylation at the P2-4 IGF2 promoters, suggesting further spreading during the neoplastic process. In tumors, this methylation is associated with diminished or absent IGF2 expression from the methylated P3 promoter but maintained expression from P1, an upstream promoter that is not contained within the IGF2 CpG island. Our results demonstrate a remarkable evolution of methylation patterns in the imprinted promoter of the IGF2 gene during aging and carcinogenesis, and provide further evidence for a potential link between aberrant methylation and diseases of aging.","['Issa, J P', 'Vertino, P M', 'Boehm, C D', 'Newsham, I F', 'Baylin, S B']","['Issa JP', 'Vertino PM', 'Boehm CD', 'Newsham IF', 'Baylin SB']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colon/*metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.21.11757 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 15;93(21):11757-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.21.11757.,PMC38131,,"['2R01CA43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA54396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replication-competent RNAs were transcribed in vitro and introduced into the cytoplasm of BHK-21 cells using electroporation. The expressed Moloney murine leukemia virus structural proteins produced extracellular virus-like particles. In these particles the gag precursor was processed into mature products, indicating that the particles contained an active protease. The protease of the gag-pol fusion protein was also shown to be active in a trans-complementation assay using a large excess of Pr65gag. Moreover, the particles possessed reverse transcriptase (RT) activity as measured in an in vitro assay.

A single receptor appears to be necessary and sufficient for entry of many retroviruses, but exceptions to this simple model are accumulating. For example, HIV requires two proteins for cell entry, neither of which alone is sufficient; 10A1 murine leukemia virus can enter cells by using either of two distinct receptors; two retroviruses can use different receptors in some cells but use the same receptor for entry into other cells; and posttranslational protein modifications and secreted factors can dramatically influence virus entry. These findings greatly complicate the rules governing retrovirus tropism. The mechanism underlying retrovirus evolution to use many receptors for cell entry is not clear, although some evidence supports a mutational model for the evolution of new receptor specificities.

The retroviral/VSV-G pseudotypes generated using 293GPG cells were significantly more resistant to human complement than commonly used amphotropic vectors and could be highly concentrated (> 1000-fold). This new packaging cell line may prove to be particularly useful for assessing the potential use of retroviral vectors for direct in vivo gene transfer. The design of the cell line also provides at least theoretical advantages over existing cell lines with regard to the possible release of replication-competent virus.","['Ory, D S', 'Neugeboren, B A', 'Mulligan, R C']","['Ory DS', 'Neugeboren BA', 'Mulligan RC']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Kidney', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.21.11400 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 15;93(21):11400-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.21.11400.,PMC38069,,"['HL02910/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL41484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the work presented here we have further defined the HL60 amplicon and find it to be of the order of 160 kb and to contain a large region of DNA from chromosome 8q24 that is located at least 260 kb telomeric to the c-myc gene, joined to the 70 kb of DNA from the c-myc gene region. The novel chromosome 8 DNA coamplified sequences are not lost during multiple passage of HL60 cells since the composition of the chimeric amplicon is the same in both early passage HL60 cells containing only double minutes (DMs) and late passage isolates containing homogeneous staining regions (HSRs) at different chromosomal locations. This shows that the HL60 HSRs found in late passage cells are not generated anew but are directly derived from the precursor DMs. The HL60 cells contain two copies of chromosome 8, each with different polymorphic markers. Both these chromosome 8 homologues retain a c-myc gene as well as the region containing the coamplified DNA sequences indicating that the HL60 amplicons were not generated by simple DNA deletion. The constraint to maintain the novel DNA sequences coamplified with c-myc gene DNA suggests that these sequences may play some role in maintaining the growth potential and/or differentiation capacity of the HL60 cells.","['Feo, S', 'Di Liegro, C', 'Mangano, R', 'Read, M', 'Fried, M']","['Feo S', 'Di Liegro C', 'Mangano R', 'Read M', 'Fried M']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Cellulare e dello Sviluppo, Viale delle Scienze, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/03 00:00,1996/10/03 00:01,['1996/10/03 00:00'],"['1996/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Oct 3;13(7):1521-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of Bcl-2, which is known to promote cell survival, is shown here to influence both these critical steps. Bcl-2 function during myelomonocytic differentiation was investigated by introducing a deregulated bcl-2 gene into HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, which can be induced to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into granulocytes or monocytes. Deregulated Bcl-2 expression did not itself promote differentiation but extended the lifespan of mature cells elicited by granulocytic or monocytic inducers. Unexpectedly, in response to induction, Bcl-2 overexpression markedly potentiated and hastened cell cycle withdrawal into G(0). Enhanced survival cannot account for the elevated numbers of G(0) cells, because they arose under induction conditions that did not kill control cells. Since the cell cycle status and growth of uninduced cells was not affected by Bcl-2-overexpression, its cell cycle inhibitory activity must require an induction signal. While cell cycle withdrawal may be necessary for maturation, it was not sufficient, implicating a requirement for specific differentiative signals. These results identify, for the first time, a function for the bcl-2 proto-oncogene that is separable from its enhancement of cell survival.","['Vairo, G', 'Innes, K M', 'Adams, J M']","['Vairo G', 'Innes KM', 'Adams JM']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/03 00:00,1996/10/03 00:01,['1996/10/03 00:00'],"['1996/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Oct 3;13(7):1511-9.,,,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through screening of a satellite CBA/H colony and rescreening of the original colony, we show that, whereas germline telomere sequence polymorphism is frequent in CBA/H mice, there is no genetic link between a specific TLR locus variant and susceptibility to AML. Studies on telomere-hybridising fragments between 200 bp and 150 kb revealed that the germline telomere mutation frequency was highest for restriction fragments > 50 kb.

Although it was not possible to ascribe a specific somatic telomere mutation to AML development, telomere rearrangements were common in induced AMLs. Some terminal telomere-hybridising restriction fragments were shortened in AML samples in comparison with normal tissue, but, insofar as the reduction in size was relatively small, it seems unlikely that telomere erosion is a major contributor to the molecular pathology of murine radiation-induced AML.","['Meijne, E I', 'Silver, A R', 'Bouffler, S D', 'Morris, D J', 'van Kampen, E W', 'Spanjer, S', 'Huiskamp, R', 'Cox, R']","['Meijne EI', 'Silver AR', 'Bouffler SD', 'Morris DJ', 'van Kampen EW', 'Spanjer S', 'Huiskamp R', 'Cox R']","['Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Petten, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Telomere/*genetics/radiation effects', 'X-Rays']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199608)16:4<230::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199608)16:4<230::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 Aug;16(4):230-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199608)16:4<230::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro lipofection of embryonically derived 3T3 cells by several of the tested cationic lipids decreases in the presence of human amniotic fluid, while two formulations, Lipid 67 and Tfx-50, remain highly active. As some body fluids are known to inactivate most retroviral vectors, we investigated the influence of amniotic fluid on the efficiency of infection of 3T3 cells by murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV)-based vectors, including amphotropic and ecotropic retrovirus, and a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) glycoprotein pseudotyped retroviral vector. All showed a decrease of infectivity from 21 to 56% in the presence of amniotic fluid. The ecotropic retrovirus is the most infectious under normal conditions as well as in amniotic fluid. Our results suggest that intra-amniotic injection may allow efficient gene transfer using either amniotic fluid-resistant cationic lipids or ecotropic retroviral vectors in a murine in vivo model for foetal gene therapy. The VSV-G-pseudotyped vector, although displaying a decrease of infectivity, remains of great interest for gene delivery, because of its broad host range and because of the high virus titers achievable. Finally, a baculovirus-based vector shows no decrease of its infectivity and does not seem to be affected by amniotic fluid but has only low infectivity on the tested foetal fibroblast cell line.","['Douar, A M', 'Themis, M', 'Sandig, V', 'Friedmann, T', 'Coutelle, C']","['Douar AM', 'Themis M', 'Sandig V', 'Friedmann T', 'Coutelle C']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Imperial College, Medical School at St Mary's London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Amniotic Fluid', 'Animals', 'Cations', 'Cell Line', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', '*Lipids', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Nucleopolyhedroviruses/genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Retroviridae', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1996 Sep;3(9):789-96.,,,"['CHD 20034/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 53680/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about possible variations of total tubulin and tubulin isotype expression during the cell cycle. We analyzed the total tubulin content, tubulin polymerization status and tubulin isotype content in resting and dividing human K562 leukemic cells and human MES-SA sarcoma cells. Although the total cellular tubulin content increases as the cells progress toward mitosis, the total tubulin/total protein ratio is stable during the cell cycle. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was applied to analyze the levels of expression of alpha, beta, and gamma-tubulin isotypes. Whereas alpha-tubulin isotype and gamma-tubulin transcripts were found to be expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle, some of the beta-tubulin isotype transcripts were found to be more highly expressed in dividing then in resting cells. Both of the class IV beta-tubulin isotype transcripts (human 5 beta and beta 2, Class IVa and IVb, respectively) were expressed in dividing K562 and MES-SA cells at twice the levels found in resting cells. Increased expression of the class IV isotype proteins in dividing cells was confirmed by immunoblotting, both in K562 and in MES-SA cells. A larger fraction of total cell tubulin was found to be polymerized in dividing cells (36-40%) than in resting cells (27-30%). The degree of polymerization of class IV tubulin in dividing and resting cells was similar to that of total tubulin. These results show that total tubulin is expressed as constant levels throughout the cell cycle but that the degree of polymerization is increased as cells are committed to division. The relative overexpression of the two class IV beta-tubulin isotypes in dividing cells suggests functional specificity for these isotypes and a regulatory role of these isotypes on the microtubule network during mitosis.","['Dumontet, C', 'Duran, G E', 'Steger, K A', 'Murphy, G L', 'Sussman, H H', 'Sikic, B I']","['Dumontet C', 'Duran GE', 'Steger KA', 'Murphy GL', 'Sussman HH', 'Sikic BI']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"['0 (Polymers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Polymers/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sarcoma', 'Solubility', 'Tubulin/analysis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1996)35:1<49::AID-CM4>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1996)35:1<49::AID-CM4>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1996;35(1):49-58. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1996)35:1<49::AID-CM4>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,['R01 CA 68217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alloantibody eluted from human placenta has been shown to inhibit killing by human NK cells. Do those antibodies to R80K that inhibit NK killing also affect the murine abortion models? METHODS: We made three murine monoclonal antibodies to conserved epitopes, on human R80K, all of which also reacted with the homologous murine molecule. One antibody only, BA11, suppressed NK cytotoxicity to K562 and of mouse spleen NK cells to murine trophoblast. All three were tested in mouse models of abortion: the CBA x DBA/2 model with a high resorption rate of F1 embryos compared with the parental strains, an endotoxin induced abortion/resorption model and a third model in which the pregnant mouse is subject to sonic stress. CONCLUSION: Those IgG antibodies eluted from microvesicles which bound to K562, and one of the three monoclonals, BA11, inhibited NK killing. The antibodies react with the murine molecule, and BA11 inhibited abortion in all three mouse abortion models. This reinforces the thesis that interference with NK killing can influence abortion/resorption in mice, and the BA11 antibody may effect similar results in analogous human situations.","['Jalali, G R', 'Arck, P', 'Surridge, S', 'Markert, U', 'Chaouat, G', 'Clark, D A', 'Underwood, J L', 'Mowbray, J F']","['Jalali GR', 'Arck P', 'Surridge S', 'Markert U', 'Chaouat G', 'Clark DA', 'Underwood JL', 'Mowbray JF']","[""Imperial College School of Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, England.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/pharmacology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoantibodies/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*immunology', 'Trophoblasts/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.1996.tb00153.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 1996 Sep;36(3):129-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1996.tb00153.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of leukemia by MuLVs is complex, requiring multiple steps beginning with infection of an appropriate target cell. A number of investigators have proposed a bone marrow-thymus axis in the development of retrovirus induced T-cell lymphoma in which cells are initially infected in the bone marrow. These bone marrow cells or their progeny migrate to the thymus during the disease process. In our system using adult, immunocompetent BALB.K mice infected with E-55(+) MuLV, a similar pattern is seen; integrated virus is initially detectable in the bone marrow and spleen and only later in the thymus. In order to better understand the leukemic process, we analyzed the bone marrow from adult, immunocompetent BALB.K mice infected with the E-55(+) MuLV in bone marrow colony assays.

We examined a multiinstitutional data base to reevaluate the risk among survivors of Ewing's sarcoma and to identify possible causal factors. METHODS: Information was derived from a data base that included 266 survivors of Ewing's sarcoma. Cumulative incidence rates of second malignancies were calculated. Contributions of clinical features, type and dose of chemotherapy, and cumulative radiation dose to the risk of second malignancies were evaluated. RESULTS: After a median follow-up duration of 9.5 years (range, 3.0 to 30), 16 patients have developed second malignancies, which included 10 sarcomas (five osteosarcomas, three fibrosarcomas, and two malignant fibrous histiocytomas) and six other malignancies (acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, meningioma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix). The median latency to the diagnosis of the second malignancy was 7.6 years (range, 3.5 to 25.7). The estimated cumulative incidence rates at 20 years for any second malignancy and for secondary sarcoma were 9.2% (SD = 2.7%) and 6.5% (SD = 2.4%), respectively. The cumulative incidence rate of secondary sarcoma was radiation dose-dependent (P = .002). No secondary sarcomas developed among patients who had received less than 48 Gy, while the absolute risk of secondary sarcoma was 130 cases per 10,000 person-years of observation among patients who had received > or = 60 Gy. CONCLUSION: The overall risk of second malignancies after Ewing's sarcomas is similar to that associated with treatment for other childhood cancers. The radiation dose-dependency of secondary sarcomas justifies modification in therapy to reduce radiation doses.","['Kuttesch, J F Jr', 'Wexler, L H', 'Marcus, R B', 'Fairclough, D', 'Weaver-McClure, L', 'White, M', 'Mao, L', 'Delaney, T F', 'Pratt, C B', 'Horowitz, M E', 'Kun, L E']","['Kuttesch JF Jr', 'Wexler LH', 'Marcus RB', 'Fairclough D', 'Weaver-McClure L', 'White M', 'Mao L', 'Delaney TF', 'Pratt CB', 'Horowitz ME', 'Kun LE']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.

Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Relapse Study Group.,2812-7,"PURPOSE: In newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a high tumor burden indicates a poor prognosis, while no such link has been established yet after relapse. The impact of the absolute peripheral blast count (PBC) at the time of relapse on the response to salvage chemotherapy after a late isolated bone marrow (BM) relapse is the subject of this prospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1983, 260 children with a first isolated BM relapse of ALL that occurred 6 months or later after elective cessation of front-line therapy were enrolled onto four consecutive multicenter trials of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Relapse Study Group. All patients received intensive multiagent induction and consolidation chemotherapy for 6 months, followed by maintenance therapy with methotrexate (MTX) and thioguanine for 2 years. Treatment of subclinical meningeal leukemia consisted of high-dose intravenous MTX and intrathecally administered cytostatic drugs, which was augmented by cranial irradiation since 1988. RESULTS: At the time relapse was diagnosed, PBC varied considerably among patients (median, 1,060/microL; range, 0 to 106,800/microL). Achievement of a second complete remission (CR) was not significantly different in children without detectable circulating blasts at relapse (37 of 38) and those with moderate (1 to 9,999/microL) PBC (165 of 171). In contrast, only 42 of 51 children with high PBC (> or = 10,000/microL) achieved a second CR (P = .0015). At a median follow-up time of 40 months, the 10-year event-free survival (EFS) probability was significantly (P = .0001) higher in children without circulating blasts (.64) than in children with moderate PBC (.32) or high PBC (.10). There was a preponderance of boys in the group without detectable circulating blasts, while the three PBC-defined groups did not differ with respect to frontline treatment, age at initial diagnosis, age at relapse, time off therapy, or salvage treatment protocol. On sequential univariate and multivariate analysis, only duration of first remission > or = 48 months was an additional independent indicator of adverse prognosis, while preventive cranial irradiation improved outcome independently of PBC. CONCLUSION: The absence of blasts on peripheral-blood smears at the time of a first late isolated BM relapse of childhood ALL is associated with a favorable response and prognosis in chemotherapy-treated children, who should be regarded as ineligible for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) unless a second round of chemotherapy has failed to produce a response.","['Buhrer, C', 'Hartmann, R', 'Fengler, R', 'Rath, B', 'Schrappe, M', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Henze, G']","['Buhrer C', 'Hartmann R', 'Fengler R', 'Rath B', 'Schrappe M', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Henze G']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Virchow Medical Center, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.10.2812 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Oct;14(10):2812-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.10.2812.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-three patients were treated from January 1986 to May 1992. dMTX was given weekly during consolidation and biweekly for the first 16 months of continuation therapy with mercaptopurine (6-MP) and asparaginase (L-ASP). Initially, etoposide (VP-16) and cytarabine (Ara-C) pulses were included. Treatment continued for 30 months with single-dose weekly MTX replacing dMTX during continuation, part 2. Unexpected acute neurotoxicity was eliminated by the addition of leucovorin. VP-16 and Ara-C were omitted in the face of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients entered remission: 16 had a lymphoid marrow relapse, two each with testicular or CNS relapse; 19 a CNS relapse; 16 secondary AML; three other second malignancies; two withdrew for transplant; three died in remission; 16 withdrew because of noncompliance, and nine withdrew with toxicity. Event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 73 +/- 4%; 81 +/- 4% for 150 patients with better risk features and 60 +/- 7% for 93 with high-risk features. Lymphoid marrow relapse-free survival in the standard- and high-risk patients was 94 +/- 3% and 86% +/- 6%, respectively. The most common adverse event was secondary AML in the standard-risk group and isolated CNS relapse in the high-risk group. CONCLUSION: This therapy produced an overall EFS similar to other published regimens, but the pattern of failures is very different, with few patients having a lymphoid marrow relapse. These data suggest that highly effective therapy for children with ALL can be delivered on an outpatient basis using a regimen featuring repetitive dMTX.","['Winick, N', 'Shuster, J J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Borowitz, M', 'Farrow, A', 'Jacaruso, D', 'Buchanan, G R', 'Kamen, B A']","['Winick N', 'Shuster JJ', 'Bowman WP', 'Borowitz M', 'Farrow A', 'Jacaruso D', 'Buchanan GR', 'Kamen BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA.

More patient years at risk enabled a further analysis of the risk of second tumors to be performed in the 1,377 women treated in this until up to 1990. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Health questionnaires were returned on 93.3% of patients who successfully completed chemotherapy and were living in the United Kingdom. The remainder were flagged for death or developing further cancers by the Office of Population Census and Surveys and by the Thames Cancer Registry. Incidence density analysis was performed based on 15,279 person-years of observation available. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of second tumors associated with the treatment. To calculate the expected number, the actual incidence rates observed by the Thames Cancer Registry during the same calendar period of observation were used. RESULTS: An overall 50% excess of risk (RR = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.1; P < .011) was observed: there were 37 second tumors, when 24.5 were expected. For specific second tumors, the risk was significantly increased for myeloid leukemia (RR = 16.6; 95% CI, 5.4 to 38.9), colon (RR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 10.7), and breast cancer when the survival exceeded 25 years (RR = 5.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 16.9). The risk was not significantly increased among the 554 women receiving single-agent therapy (RR = 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6 to 2.1). Leukemias only developed in patients receiving etoposide plus other cytotoxic drugs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is a slight increased risk of second tumors after sequential or combination chemotherapy for GTT. This has become apparent since the introduction of etoposide and longer follow-up.","['Rustin, G J', 'Newlands, E S', 'Lutz, J M', 'Holden, L', 'Bagshawe, K D', 'Hiscox, J G', 'Foskett, M', 'Fuller, S', 'Short, D']","['Rustin GJ', 'Newlands ES', 'Lutz JM', 'Holden L', 'Bagshawe KD', 'Hiscox JG', 'Foskett M', 'Fuller S', 'Short D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Charing Cross Hospital, London, United Kingdom.

A number of studies have observed an increased incidence of treatment-related leukemias following chemotherapy with alkylating agents and/or topoisomerase II inhibitors. We evaluated the incidence of treatment-related leukemias in breast cancer patients treated in four adjuvant and two neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 1,474 patients with stage II or III breast cancer were treated in six prospective trials of adjuvant (n = 4) or neoadjuvant (n = 2) chemotherapy with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (CTX) (FAC) with or without other drugs. The median observation time was 97 months. In 1,107 patients, FAC chemotherapy was given postoperatively; 367 patients received induction chemotherapy, as well as postoperative chemotherapy. Eight hundred ten patients had surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy; 664 patients had surgery and chemotherapy only. Patients in two adjuvant and one neoadjuvant study received higher cumulative doses of CTX compared with those in the other studies. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of leukemia were observed. Twelve of these patients had received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and two had received chemotherapy only. Six of the reported patients with leukemia were treated with a cumulative CTX dose of greater than 6 g/ m2. Five of these patients had received both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The median latency period in the 14 patients was 66 months (range, 22 to 113). Six of 10 patients with adequate cytogenetic analyses had abnormalities that involved chromosomes 5 and/or 7. The rest of the patients had nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities or lacked cytogenetic information. The 10-year estimated leukemia rate was 1.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7% to 2.9%) for all patients treated, 2.5% (95% CI, 1.0% to 5.1%) for the radiotherapy-plus-chemotherapy group, and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1% to 2.4%) for the chemotherapy-only group; this difference was statistically significant (P = .01). The 10-year estimated leukemia risk for the higher-dose (> 6 g/m2) CTX group was 2% (95% CI, 0.5% to 5.0%) compared with 1.3% (95% CI, 0.4% to 3.0%) for the lower-dose group, a difference that was not statistically significant (P = .53). CONCLUSION: These data illustrate that patients treated with adjuvant FAC chemotherapy plus radiotherapy have a slightly increased risk of leukemia. This information needs to be considered in the treatment plans for patients with breast cancer. However, for most patients, the benefits of adjuvant therapy exceed the risk of treatment-related leukemia.","['Diamandidou, E', 'Buzdar, A U', 'Smith, T L', 'Frye, D', 'Witjaksono, M', 'Hortobagyi, G N']","['Diamandidou E', 'Buzdar AU', 'Smith TL', 'Frye D', 'Witjaksono M', 'Hortobagyi GN']","['Department of Breast and Gynecologic Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.10.2722 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Oct;14(10):2722-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.10.2722.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no comparable data on the relationship between CD34+ cell dose and recovery after allogeneic bone marrow transplants (BMT). Twenty-eight patients with hematologic malignancies received a BMT from an HLA-identical sibling, using T-cell depletion and cyclosporin for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis and delayed donor lymphocyte transfusions in an attempt to prevent leukemia relapse. The treatment-related mortality (TRM), primarily due to infections and cytopenias, was significantly higher for 13 patients receiving less than 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (64.9% +/- 12.8% v 6.9% +/- 6.4%, P = .003).

Patients receiving more than 2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg showed significantly earlier recovery of monocytes and a trend for earlier recovery of lymphocytes. They achieved platelet and red blood cell transfusion independence earlier, required less granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support during ganciclovir treatment, and spent fewer days in the hospital after transplantation. These results suggest that, for allogeneic T-cell-depleted BMT, the higher CD34+ cell doses may improve outcome in engrafting patients.","['Mavroudis, D', 'Read, E', 'Cottler-Fox, M', 'Couriel, D', 'Molldrem, J', 'Carter, C', 'Yu, M', 'Dunbar, C', 'Barrett, J']","['Mavroudis D', 'Read E', 'Cottler-Fox M', 'Couriel D', 'Molldrem J', 'Carter C', 'Yu M', 'Dunbar C', 'Barrett J']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/statistics & numerical data', '*Cell Count', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61566-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3223-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both receptors promote degradation of fibrin(ogen) and also confer adhesive properties on cells because Mac-1 and uPAR bind fibrin and vitronectin, respectively. Staining of lung biopsy specimens from patients with acute lung injury indicated that fibrin and vitronectin colocalize at exudative sites in which macrophages bearing these receptors accumulate. Because of the parallel roles and physical proximity of Mac-1 and uPAR, the capacity of these receptors to functionally interact was explored. Induction of Mac-1 and uPAR expression on monocytic cell lines by transforming growth factor- beta 1 and 1.25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 conferred urokinase and uPAR-dependent adhesion to vitronectin, which was further promoted by engagement of Mac-1. Vitronectin attachment promoted subsequent Mac-1-mediated fibrinogen degradation threefold to fourfold. In contrast, enhancement of uPAR occupancy by exogenous urokinase or receptor binding fragments thereof inhibited Mac-1 function. Addition of urokinase progressively inhibited Mac-1-mediated fibrinogen binding and degradation (maximal inhibition, 91% +/- 14% and 72% +/- 15%, respectively). Saturation of uPAR with urokinase also inhibited binding of the procoagulant Mac-1 ligand, Factor X. These inhibitory effects of uPAR were reproduced in fresh monocytes, cultured monocytic cells, and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with both human Mac-1 and human uPAR. These data show that the procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential of monocytic cells is co-ordinately regulated by ligand binding to both Mac-1 and uPAR and identify uPAR as a regulator of integrin function. Vitronectin-enhanced fibrin(ogen) turnover by Mac-1 may operate as a salvage pathway in the setting of urokinase and plasmin inhibitors to promote clearance of the provisional matrix and subsequent healing.","['Simon, D I', 'Rao, N K', 'Xu, H', 'Wei, Y', 'Majdic, O', 'Ronne, E', 'Kobzik, L', 'Chapman, H A']","['Simon DI', 'Rao NK', 'Xu H', 'Wei Y', 'Majdic O', 'Ronne E', 'Kobzik L', 'Chapman HA']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '9001-29-0 (Factor X)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Coagulation/physiology', 'CD18 Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cricetinae', 'Factor X/metabolism', 'Fibrin/metabolism', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Lung Injury', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/genetics/*physiology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Monocytes/chemistry/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/pharmacology', 'Vitronectin/metabolism']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61561-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3185-94.,,,"['HL-44712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02768/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, we correlated the growth pattern with the clinical outcome of patients from whom the leukemic cells were derived. The leukemias displayed three distinct growth patterns, ie, either aggressive, indolent, or no tumor growth. Leukemic cells from 6 of 13 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 4 of 7 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and 11 of 16 patients with B-lineage ALL grew as subcutaneous tumors, with a significant number subsequently disseminating into distant organs in SCID mice. Patients whose leukemic blasts displayed an aggressive growth and dissemination pattern in SCID mice had a relatively poor clinical outcome, whereas patients with AML and T- or B-lineage ALL whose leukemic blasts grew indolently or whose cells failed to induce growth had a more favorable clinical course. Our study has shown that the subcutaneous inoculation of patient-derived human leukemic cells in SCID mice can engraft and grow as subcutaneous tumors with subsequent dissemination to distant organs in a manner analogous to their pattern of growth in humans. Additionally, these data suggest a clinical correlation to the growth and dissemination of some leukemic subtypes that may represent not only an additional prognosticator for patient outcome, but also a vehicle for the study of the biologic behavior of human leukemias and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Yan, Y', 'Salomon, O', 'McGuirk, J', 'Dennig, D', 'Fernandez, J', 'Jagiello, C', 'Nguyen, H', 'Collins, N', 'Steinherz, P', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Yan Y', 'Salomon O', 'McGuirk J', 'Dennig D', 'Fernandez J', 'Jagiello C', 'Nguyen H', 'Collins N', 'Steinherz P', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*pathology']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61556-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3137-46.,,,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports have suggested the involvement of a tumor suppressor gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13, between the retinoblastoma (RB) and D13S25 loci, in the pathogenesis and or progression of more than 40% of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a common lymphoid malignancy whose molecular etiology remains largely unknown. In the present study, we report the construction and characterization of a YAC contig spanning a region of approximately 3 cM between the RB gene and the D13S31 locus. We also screened 60 paired normal/tumor B-CLL samples for allelic loss on chromosome 13 with nine microsatellite markers located between RB and D13S25.

We investigated the effect of genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on the in vitro growth of CML and normal marrow-derived multi-potent (colony-forming unit-mix [CFU-Mix]), erythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]), and granulocyte-macrophage (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM]) hematopoietic progenitors. Continuous exposure of CML and normal marrow to genistein induced a statistically significant and dose-dependent suppression of colony formation. Genistein doses causing 50% inhibition of CML and normal progenitors were not significantly different for CFU-Mix (27 mumol/L v 23 mumol/L), BFU-E (31 mumol/L v 29 mumol/L), and CFU-GM (40 mumol/L v 32 mumol/L v 32 mumol/L). Preincubation of CML and normal marrow with genistein (200 mumol/ L for 1 to 18 hours) induced a time-dependent suppression of progenitor cell growth, while sparing a substantial proportion of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) from CML (range, 91% +/- 9% to 32% +/- 3%) and normal marrow (range, 85% +/- 8% to 38% +/- 9%). Analysis of individual CML colonies for the presence of the hybrid BCR/ABL mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that genistein treatment significantly reduced the mean +/- SD percentage of marrow BCR/ABL+ progenitors both by continuous exposure (76% +/- 18% v 24% +/- 12%, P < or = .004) or preincubation (75% +/- 16% v 21% +/- 10%, P < or = .002) experiments. Preincubation with genistein reduced the percentage of leukemic LTC-IC from 87% +/- 12% to 37% +/- 12% (P < or = .003). Analysis of individual colonies by cytogenetics and RT-PCR confirmed that genistein-induced increase in the percentage of nonleukemic progenitors was not due to suppression of BCR/ABL transcription. Analysis of nuclear DNA fragmentation by DNA gel electrophoresis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay showed that preincubation of CML mononuclear and CD34+ cells with genistein induced significant evidence of apoptosis. These observations show that genistein is capable of (1) exerting a strong antiproliferative effect on CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM while sparing the more primitive LTC-IC and (2) selecting benign hematopoietic progenitors from CML marrow, probably through an apoptotic mechanism.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Dotti, G', 'Mangoni, L', 'Regazzi, E', 'Garau, D', 'Bonati, A', 'Almici, C', 'Sammarelli, G', 'Savoldo, B', 'Rizzo, M T', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Dotti G', 'Mangoni L', 'Regazzi E', 'Garau D', 'Bonati A', 'Almici C', 'Sammarelli G', 'Savoldo B', 'Rizzo MT', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Genistein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61550-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3091-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the MTAP gene is located adjacent to the tumor-suppressor gene p16 on chromosome 9p21 and more than 60% of T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients have deletion in the p16 gene, we examined the status of the MTAP gene in T-ALL patients. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification of exon 8 of MTAP showed a deletion in 16 of 48 (33.3%) patients at diagnosis and in 13 of 33 (39.4%) patients at relapse. Southern blot analysis showed that, in addition to deletion of the entire MTAP gene, a common break point was between exons 4 and 5, resulting in deletion of exons 5 through 8. The finding of frequent deficiency of MTAP in T-ALL offers the possibility of an enzyme targeted therapy for T-ALL. MTAP(-) T-ALL-derived cell line, CEM cells were very sensitive to methionine deprivation, with cell viability at 50% of control as early as 48 hours after methionine deprivation. In contrast, methionine deprivation had little effect on the viability of normal lymphocytes or on their proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin. Alanosine, an inhibitor of AMP synthesis, inhibited the growth of both MTAP(+) (Molt-4 and Molt-16) and MTAP(-) (CEM and HSB2) cell lines. However, the addition of methylthioadenosine, the substrate of MTAP, protected the MTAP(+) cells but not the MTAP(-) cells from alanosine toxicity.

Of 15 cases, rhTPO supported proliferation of AML cells for 2 to 4 weeks in 4 cases whose French-American-British subtypes were M0, M2, M4, and M7, respectively. In addition to the proliferation-supporting activity, rhTPO was found to induce AML cells to progress to some degree of megakaryocytic differentiation at both morphologic and surface-phenotypic level in 2 AML cases with M0 and M7 subtypes. The treatment of AML cells with rhTPO resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO-receptor, c-mpl, and STAT3 in all of cases tested. By contrast, the expression of erythroid/megakaryocyte-specific transcription factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, and NF-E2) was markedly induced or enhanced in only 2 AML cases that showed megakaryocytic differentiation in response to rhTPO.

Southern blot analyses revealed that ATL cells in 18 cases had only one long terminal repeat (LTR). Long PCR with LTR primers showed bands shorter than for the complete virus (7.7 kb) or no bands in ATL cells with defective virus. Thus, defective virus was evident in 40 of 72 cases (56%). Two types of defective virus were identified: the first type (type 1) defective virus retained both LTRs and lacked internal sequences, which were mainly the 5' region of provirus, such as gag and pol. Type 1 defective virus was found in 43% of all defective viruses. The second form (type 2) of defective virus had only one LTR, and 5'-LTR was preferentially deleted. This type of defective virus was more frequently detected in cases of acute and lymphoma-type ATL (21/54 cases) than in the chronic type (1/18 cases). The high frequency of this defective virus in the aggressive form of ATL suggests that it may be caused by the genetic instability of HTLV-I provirus, and cells with this defective virus are selected because they escape from immune surveillance systems.","['Tamiya, S', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Etoh, K', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kamihira, S', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Tamiya S', 'Matsuoka M', 'Etoh K', 'Watanabe T', 'Kamihira S', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Preleukemia/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61547-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3065-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many CD24 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have been described that identify several epitopes, with the majority of them related to carbohydrate structures associated with the CD24 molecule. Considerable variation has been observed in the apparent tissue distribution of the CD24 antigen depending on the MoAb used, and hence the CD24 epitope studied. In this study, CD24 expression by human cell lines and normal hematopoietic call populations was assessed using a panel of carbohydrate and protein core-specific CD24 MoAbs and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. A number of CD24 carbohydrate epitope-reactive MoAbs bound to both T lymphocytes and several hematopoietic cell lines, despite the absence of concomitant CD24 mRNA or detectable surface CD24 core protein in the same cells. This additional CD24 MoAb reactivity on T lymphocytes was, in common with that observed on granulocytes (CD24 protein+), specifically inhibited by the presence of both sialyllactose and mucin. Similarly, the binding of carbohydrate epitops-reactive CD24 MoAb was reduced on both T lymphocytes and granulocytes by pretreatment with phospholipase C, pronase, or neuraminidase. Together, the data indicate that a number of CD24-associated carbohydrate epitopes have a broader tissue distribution than the CD24 protein and are expressed on additional GPI-linked molecule(s). These findings have immediate implications for both leukemia phenotyping and attempts to examine CD24 function with CD24 MoAb.","['Williams, L A', 'Hock, B D', 'Hart, D N']","['Williams LA', 'Hock BD', 'Hart DN']","['Haematology/Immunology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Cd24a protein, mouse)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/chemistry/immunology', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Carbohydrates/*biosynthesis/chemistry/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/*biosynthesis/chemistry/immunology', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Glycosylation', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pronase/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61545-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3048-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the expression of three genes involved in erythroid cell iron metabolism (gamma-globin, H-ferritin, and transferrin receptor [TfR]), we developed a series of human K562 erythroleukemic cell clones retrovirally transduced with inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) and producing different steady-state levels of NO. gamma-Globin and H-ferritin protein expression was reduced in NO-producing cells in relation to the amount of NO produced. Conversely, cell surface TfR expression increased in NO-producing clones. Both the inhibitory effects of NO on gamma-globin and H-ferritin expression and the stimulatory effect on TfR were reversed by the NOS inhibitor NG-methyl-L-arginine (NGMMA). gamma-Globin and H-ferritin mRNA levels were unaffected by NO production. In the case of TfR, NO appeared to stabilize mRNA in that the half life of TfR mRNA decreased from approximately 15 hours to less than 3 hours when NO production by NOS-transduced clones was inhibited. Thus, NO can regulate expression of these genes at the posttranscriptional level, an effect that is likely mediated by the known effect of NO on the RNA binding activity of iron regulatory protein-1 (Pantopoulos and Hentze, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:1267, 1995). Furthermore, our findings suggest a mechanism for the observed relationship between NO production and the pathophysiology of the anemia of chronic disease.","['Domachowske, J B', 'Rafferty, S P', 'Singhania, N', 'Mardiney, M 3rd', 'Malech, H L']","['Domachowske JB', 'Rafferty SP', 'Singhania N', 'Mardiney M 3rd', 'Malech HL']","['Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",1996/10/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61537-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):2980-8.,,,,"['GENBANK/L20941', 'GENBANK/M11427', 'GENBANK/M11507', 'GENBANK/X60364']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients less than 65 years of age with de novo or secondary AML were randomized for induction between SDAC 200 mg/ m2/d for 7 days by continuous infusion or HDAC at 2 g/ m2 intravenously every 12 hours for 12 doses; both groups received daunorubicin (DNR) at 45 mg/m2/d intravenously for 3 days. Complete responders to SDAC were randomized to receive either two additional courses of SDAC plus DNR or one course of HDAC plus DNR. Complete responders to HDAC were nonrandomly assigned to receive one additional course of HDAC plus DNR. Of patients randomized between SDAC (n = 493) and HDAC (n = 172) induction, 361 achieved complete remission (CR). The CR rate was slightly poorer with HDAC: 55% versus 58% with SDAC for patients aged less than 50, and 45% (HDAC) versus 53% (SDAC) for patients aged 50 to 64 (age-adjusted one-tailed P = .96). With a median follow-up time of 51 months, survival was not significantly better with HDAC (P = .41); the estimated survival rate at 4 years was 32% (HDAC) versus 22% (SDAC) for those aged less than 50, and 13% (HDAC) versus 11% (SDAC) for those aged 50 to 64. However, relapse-free survival was somewhat better following HDAC Induction (P = .049): 33% (HDAC) versus 21% (SDAC) at 4 years for those aged less than 50, and 21% (HDAC) versus 9% (SDAC) for those aged 50 to 64. Induction with HDAC was associated with a significantly increased risk of fatal (P = .0033) and neurologic (P < .0001) toxicity. Among patients who achieved CR with SDAC, survival and disease-free survival (DFS) following consolidation randomization were not significantly better with HDAC compared with SDAC (P = .77 and .46, respectively). Patients who received both HDAC induction and consolidation had the best postremission outcomes; however, the proportion of CR patients who did not go on to protocol consolidation therapy was more than twice as high after HDAC induction compared with SDAC. Induction therapy with HDAC plus DNR was associated with greater toxicity than SDAC plus DNR, but with no improvement in CR rate or survival. Following CR induction with SDAC, consolidation with HDAC increased toxicity but not survival or DFS. In a nonrandomized comparison, patients who received both HDAC induction and consolidation had superior survival and DFS compared with those who received SDAC induction with either SDAC or HDAC consolidation.","['Weick, J K', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Head, D R', 'Kingsbury, L L', 'Balcerzak, S P', 'Bickers, J N', 'Hynes, H E', 'Welborn, J L', 'Simon, S R', 'Grever, M']","['Weick JK', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Head DR', 'Kingsbury LL', 'Balcerzak SP', 'Bickers JN', 'Hynes HE', 'Welborn JL', 'Simon SR', 'Grever M']","['Cleveland Clinic Florida, Ft Lauderdale, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61522-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):2841-51.,,,"['CA04920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis suggests that human SHIP (hSHIP) is expressed as a 5.3-kb mRNA in human bone marrow and a wide variety of other tissues.

There is evidence that PML/RAR alpha protein acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of normal retinoid receptor function and myeloid differentiation. We now show that the PML/RAR alpha fusion product is directly downregulated in response to retinoic acid (tRA) treatment in the human APL cell line, NB4. tRA treatment induces loss of PML/RAR alpha at the protein level but not at the level of mRNA, as determined by Northern blots, by Western blots, and by ligand binding assays and in binding to RA-responsive DNA elements. We present evidence that this regulation is posttranslational. This evidence suggests that tRA induces synthesis of a protein that selectively degrades PML/RAR alpha. We further show that this loss of PML/ RAR-alpha is not limited to the unique APL cell line. NB4, because PML/RAR alpha protein is selectively downregulated by tRA when expressed in the transfected myeloid cell line U937. The loss of PML/RAR alpha may be directly linked to tRA-induced differentiation, because in a retinoid-resistant subclone of NB4, tRA does not decrease PML/RAR alpha protein expression. In NB4 cells, the specific downregulation of the fusion protein decreases the ratio of PML/RAR alpha to wild-type RAR alpha. Because the ratio of expression of PML/RAR alpha to wild-type RAR alpha and PML may be important in maintaining the dominant negative block of myelocytic differentiation, these data suggest a molecular mechanism for restoration by tRA normal myeloid differentiation in APL cells.","['Raelson, J V', 'Nervi, C', 'Rosenauer, A', 'Benedetti, L', 'Monczak, Y', 'Pearson, M', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Raelson JV', 'Nervi C', 'Rosenauer A', 'Benedetti L', 'Monczak Y', 'Pearson M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer Davis Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/10/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61520-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):2826-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of the calcium channel blocker verapamil on the antiproliferative activity of epirubicin (Farmorubicin, Farmitalia) was followed up in in vitro studies on two constant human leukemia cell lines: CEM/O (P-gp negative) and CEM/VCR 1000 with a positive multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. The MTT assay was used to study the antiproliferative activity. Verapamil in concentrations of 3 and 10 micrograms/ml enhanced by 10-fold and 19-fold, respectively, the effect of epirubicin in CEM/VCR 1000 cells and had no significant effect on epirubicin activity in CEM/O. Eleven patients with measurable stage IV breast cancer, clinically resistant to anthracycline treatment, received the FEC combination (5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) twice with verapamil pretreatment, p.o. at the doses of 1280-2560 mg. There were two complete remissions (soft tissue metastases), four partial remissions (soft tissue metastases and lung metastases), and three stable diseases.

We examined the prevalence and clinical significance of the FV:Q506 mutation in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study by examining 353 consecutive, unselected patients in a general hematology/oncology clinic. We ascertained risk factors, obtained the clinical clotting history, and determined the heterozygous or homozygous presence of the FV:Q506 allele for each patient. RESULTS: We detected a germline mutation in 5.4% (19 of 353) of patients, of whom 18 were heterozygous and 1 was homozygous for the FV:Q506 mutant allele. In 17 of 18 heterozygous patients, there was no history of venous thrombosis or catheter-associated thrombosis. These asymptomatic patients included 13 patients who had been diagnosed with cancer or leukemia for a mean of 66.2 months (median 69) and had received a variety of local and systemic treatments. In contrast, 1 of 18 heterozygous and 1 of 1 homozygous patients had developed deep vein thrombosis that was associated, respectively, with either recurrent thrombotic events or a strong family history for pulmonary embolus. CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for the FV:Q506 mutation in cancer patients without a personal or family history for venous thrombosis is not helpful in guiding management. In contrast, an episode of venous thrombosis in a patient with a mutant germline FV:Q506 allele was associated with recurrent thrombotic events. These findings suggest that patients heterozygous for the FV:Q506 allele may require an independent ""susceptibility"" element to manifest a venous hypercoagulable state. In addition, only 2 of 25 clinic patients with a venous clot carried the FV:Q506 allele suggesting this genetic defect plays a minor role in the hypercoagulable state of cancer.","['Otterson, G A', 'Monahan, B P', 'Harold, N', 'Steinberg, S M', 'Frame, J N', 'Kaye, F J']","['Otterson GA', 'Monahan BP', 'Harold N', 'Steinberg SM', 'Frame JN', 'Kaye FJ']","['National Cancer Institute-Navy Oncology Branch, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland 20889, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['9001-24-5 (Factor V)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Cohort Studies', 'Factor V/*genetics', 'Female', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pulmonary Embolism/complications/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombophlebitis/complications/genetics']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9343(96)00235-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9343(96)00235-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1996 Oct;101(4):406-12. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9343(96)00235-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) fails to maintain sensory neurons cultured from embryonic day (E) 8 chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG), although DRG neurons are immunoreactive for the TGF-beta receptor type II, which is essential for TGF-beta signaling. However, in combination with various concentrations of NT-3 and NT-4, but not NGF, TGF-beta 3 causes a further significant increase in neuron survival. In DRG cell cultures treated with NGF, NT-3, and NT-4, a neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta decreases neuron survival suggesting that endogenous TGF-beta in these cultures affects the efficacies of neurotrophins. Consistent with this notion and a modulatory role of TGF-beta in neurotrophin functions is the observation that TGF-beta 2 and -beta 3 immunoreactivities and TGF-beta 3 mRNA are located in embryonic chick DRG in close association with neurons from E5 onwards. We also show that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) significantly decreases NGF-mediated DRG neuron survival. Together, these data indicate that actions and efficacies of neurotrophins are under distinct control by TGF-beta and LIF in vitro, and possibly also in vivo.","['Krieglstein, K', 'Unsicker, K']","['Krieglstein K', 'Unsicker K']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurochem Res,Neurochemical research,7613461,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ganglia, Spinal/chemistry/cytology/embryology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/chemistry/*physiology', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/*pharmacology/physiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02532308 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurochem Res. 1996 Jul;21(7):843-50. doi: 10.1007/BF02532308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many alleles were contributed to the proto-SL by the ancestors related to strains A2G and CF#1, and/or some wild mice. Among four existing family members, SL/Am and SL/Ni mice were almost identical and presumably closest to the proto-SL. The SL/Kh mouse was derived from a cross of the proto-SL and AKR mice, because SL/Kh mice inherited a considerable number of genes from AKR mice, the most outstanding of which were those of the provirus Emv-11 and Thy-1.1.

Therefore, we examined transcriptional control of the HO gene in mouse M1 (myeloleukemia) cells during their differentiation into macrophages. Since the promoter region of this gene is known to have a TPA-responsive element (TRE), its expression might be regulated by a C-kinase signal transduction pathway. Then we investigated the activation of the HO gene after treatment of M1 cells with TPA and inhibitors of C-kinase. When M1 cells were treated with TPA, they differentiated into macrophage-like cells. Upon treatment with TPA, H2O2 was produced first, the nuclear proto-oncogenes fos and jun were activated, and then the HO gene was activated. The extent of transcriptional activation of the fos, jun, and HO genes in M1 cells treated with TPA was reduced by a specific inhibitor of C-kinase and a scavenger of oxygen radicals. When M1 cells were treated with H2O2, essentially the same level of transcription of the HO gene was observed, but the extent of transcriptional activation of the fos and jun genes was about half of the treatment with TPA. Super-shift assays using the TRE of the HO gene revealed that the Fos and Jun proteins from nuclei of M1 cells treated with TPA bound to the TRE, and same assays using DNA with the NF-kappa B motif also revealed that the active NF-kappa B protein from M1 cells treated with H2O2 or TPA also bound to the corresponding motif. These results strongly suggest that the HO gene in M1 cells is activated by TPA through a production of H2O2, an oxidative activation pathway of NF-kappa B, and a signal-transduction pathway that involves C-kinase during the differentiation of macrophages that occurs upon treatment with TPA.","['Kurata, S', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Nakajima, H']","['Kurata S', 'Matsumoto M', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Biochemical Genetics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, jun', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199609)62:3<314::AID-JCB2>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199609)62:3%3C314::AID-JCB2%3E3.0.CO;2-U [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1996 Sep 1;62(3):314-24. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199609)62:3%3C314::AID-JCB2%3E3.0.CO;2-U.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Studies performed 4 to 339 days after transplantation showed ventricular enlargement and cortical atrophy in all 13 patients who had allografts. The changes were evident at 4 to 6 days after transplantation and became more obvious during later follow-up examinations. Similar changes were seen in one patient with an autograft but no significant change was seen in the other patient with an autograft or in the five control subjects. Accurately registered volume scans were more sensitive than unregistered conventional scans in detecting early (9/10 versus 0/10), intermediate (12/13 versus 3/12), and late (10/10 versus 4/9) ventricular enlargement on follow-up examinations. The same applied to cortical atrophy (9/10 versus 0/10, 12/13 versus 0/12, and 10/10 versus 0/9). CONCLUSION: The specific cause and clinical significance of these changes are uncertain. Subvoxel registration of serial MR images may reveal changes that are poorly seen or not apparent on conventional scans.","['Jager, H R', 'Williams, E J', 'Savage, D G', 'Rule, S A', 'Hajnal, J V', 'Sikora, K', 'Goldman, J M', 'Bydder, G M']","['Jager HR', 'Williams EJ', 'Savage DG', 'Rule SA', 'Hajnal JV', 'Sikora K', 'Goldman JM', 'Bydder GM']","['Robert Steiner Magnetic Resonance Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

Il-3 has been associated with the proliferation of bone marrow stem cells and their differentiation to granulocytes, macrophages, basophil/mast cells, megakaryocytes, erythroid cells, and neutrophils. The pBOR-Il-3 transgenic mice were developed by pronuclear microinjection to study how chemical insults modulate transcription of the Il-3 gene driven by a long-terminal repeat (LTR) of an endogenous retrovirus and to determine the biological consequences of interleukin-3 expression. We injected 5-azacytidine, a demethylating agent, to increase the LTR-driven expression of Il-3. Upon 5-azacytidine treatment, both the pBOR-Il-3 and the FVB/N nontransgenic controls developed thymic lymphomas. The pBOR-Il-3 mice developed thymic lymphomas at a higher frequency than the FVB/N mice. The thymic lymphoma cells were of a T-cell origin, as determined by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis, and, in most cases, were of monoclonal origin. According to flow cytometric analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell surface markers, the thymic lymphoma cells did not lose their ability to differentiate, but the differentiation process was aberrant. Flow cytometric analyses also revealed that in pBOR-Il-3 mice the thymic lymphomas are mostly of a CD8+CD4- origin, whereas in the FVB/N group, the predominant type of thymic lymphoma is of a CD4+CD8- origin.","['Saavedra, H I', 'Wang, T H', 'Hoyt, P R', 'Popp, D', 'Yang, W K', 'Stambrook, P J']","['Saavedra HI', 'Wang TH', 'Hoyt PR', 'Popp D', 'Yang WK', 'Stambrook PJ']","['Department of Anatomy, Neurobiology and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio 45267-0521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Incidence', 'Interleukin-3/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology']",1996/10/10 00:00,1996/10/10 00:01,['1996/10/10 00:00'],"['1996/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(96)90257-9 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0257 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Oct 10;173(1):116-23. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0257.,,,"['ES07250/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P2-CA-09336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'YO1-ES-4-0018/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,['Cell Immunol 1996 Dec 15;174(2):210-1'],,,,,

The frequency of tumor formation in an HTLV-I-transformed human T-cell line, MT-2 cells, at the site of inoculation was significantly higher in AAGM-treated than untreated mice (P<0.05): 16/18 (89%) and 16/26 (62%), respectively. The promotive effect of AAGM treatment on tumor development was marked in the early stage (less than 3 weeks), suggesting that the immediate reaction of natural killers to the inoculated cells may be important for the prevention of tumor development. The surface phenotypes and clonality of the tumor cells were the same as the MT-2 cells inoculated. Inoculation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from one of the 4 adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients resulted in the development of tumors in AAGM-treated SCID mice. However, the surface phenotypes of the cells from these tumors were a mixture of B cells and T cells, suggesting that these tumors consisted of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells and HTLV-I-transformed T cells. In addition, HTLV-I was detected by polymerase chain reaction in various organs of the mice inoculated with PBMC from the ATL patient and the asymptomatic carrier examined. These results suggest that elimination of natural killer function by AAGM treatment is important, although such treatment is not always necessary for the engraftment of HTLV-I-infected cells in SCID mice.","['Ishihara, S', 'Okayama, A', 'Nagatomo, Y', 'Murai, K', 'Yamashita, R', 'Okamoto, M', 'Shima, T', 'Sasaki, T', 'Mueller, N', 'Tachibana, N', 'Tsubouchi, H']","['Ishihara S', 'Okayama A', 'Nagatomo Y', 'Murai K', 'Yamashita R', 'Okamoto M', 'Shima T', 'Sasaki T', 'Mueller N', 'Tachibana N', 'Tsubouchi H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Beta-Globulins)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Beta-Globulins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/*immunology', 'Graft Survival', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation/virology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1996.tb03315.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1996;40(1):39-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1996.tb03315.x.,,,['R37CA38450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, when the cells were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or ionophore (A23187), PKCalpha and beta were predominantly translocated. Phospholipase D (PLD) was activated by three stimulants in order: A23187 > PMA >> antigen. Therefore, PKCalpha and beta seem to be involved in the activation of PLD in RBL cells. The translocation of all PKC isozymes in A23187 stimulation was weak. Therefore, PLD activation in A23187 stimulation may require some other factors than PKC which are associated with the increase of Ca2+ in the cells. The cells stimulated by antigen secreted serotonin to the same level as the cells stimulated by A23187. In both stimulation, PKCalpha and epsilon were translocated to almost similar level, suggesting that PKCalpha and epsilon are involved in the secretion. All PKC isozymes except zeta were markedly translocated in PMA stimulation, but secretion did not occur. These results indicate that translocation of PKC alpha and beta may be associated with PLD activation and also that both translocation of PKCalpha and epsilon and intracellular calcium increase are required for serotonin secretion in RBL cells.","['Ojio, K', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Miyata, H', 'Banno, Y', 'Nakashima, S', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Ojio K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Miyata H', 'Banno Y', 'Nakashima S', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Arerugi,Arerugi = [Allergy],0241212,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arerugi. 1995 Dec;44(12):1410-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a panel of 11 early-response gene probes in Northern hybridization analysis, we found that the profile of genes induced in response to bryostatin and PMA was qualitatively similar and displayed comparable sensitivities to inhibition with the serine-threonine kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine hydrochloride (H7), consistent with common signalling through protein kinase C. However, the nuclear oncogene. c-myc, which was induced strongly in response to PMA treatment, was only marginally up-regulated by bryostatin. In addition, bryostatin selectively inhibited the magnitude of PMA-responsive induction of c-myc, to a degree commensurate with its antagonistic effects seen at the biological level. Finally, an anti-sense oligonucleotide blockade of c-myc inhibited PMA-induced proliferation but not the differentiation of BCLL cells, implicating this nuclear oncogene as an important determinant distinguishing PMA from bryostatin-coupled biological responses and also as a candidate third-messenger effector target for the anti-tumour effects of bryostatin.","['Ning, Z Q', 'Hirose, T', 'Deed, R', 'Newton, J', 'Murphy, J J', 'Norton, J D']","['Ning ZQ', 'Hirose T', 'Deed R', 'Newton J', 'Murphy JJ', 'Norton JD']","[""Division of Life Sciences, King's College London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Bryostatins', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrolides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3190059 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Oct 1;319 ( Pt 1):59-65. doi: 10.1042/bj3190059.,PMC1217735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five received bone marrow while one received peripheral blood stem cells. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in five cases and an HLA-haploidentical sibling in one. The conditioning regimen included in five cases cyclophosphamide, TB1 and high-dose chlorambucil, without the latter in the patient with follicular lymphoma. RESULTS: Five patients successfully engrafted, while the patient who received the haploidentical marrow suffered primary graft failure. There were two cases of grade 2 acute GVHD and one limited chronic GVHD. Four patients are alive in complete remission (CR) with a follow-up of 17+ to 118+ months.

Follow-up information from a large series of patients may contribute to clarifying the position of this infrequent disease. METHODS: We analyzed data from 77 patients followed in five institutions. Thirty-two variables were studied for their influence on survival and on progression to acute leukemia by univariate and multivariate analysis. For some parameters, we performed a quartile analysis to reveal a possible non-monotonic influence on survival. RESULTS: Median survival was 17 months. Evolution to acute leukemia (ANLL) occurred in 11 patients (14%) within a median time of 8 months. Multivariate analysis assigned a poorer prognosis to patients presenting with thrombocytopenia, anemia and leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia and the presence of circulating blasts were risk factors for transformation to ANLL, while raised serum aspartate transaminase at diagnosis seemed to be associated with a lower probability of blastic evolution. The Bournemouth score for CMML proved to be a valid tool for predicting survival but not acute transformation. CONCLUSIONS: CMML is a severe disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of sIL2R, sCD23, sICAM-1, IL6 and sCD14 were detected in 47 B-CLL patients. Thirty-seven out of the 47 cases were in advanced/progressive stage, while the remaining 10 patients were defined as smouldering B-CLL. Twenty normal controls provided the reference values. Serum samples of 24 out 37 advanced/progressive cases were measured before and six months after the start of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The advanced/progressive patients showed significantly higher levels of sIL2R, sICAM-1 and sCD23 as compared to normal subjects. Furthermore, sIL2R, sICAM-1 and IL6 values were significantly higher in advanced/progressive B-CLL than in smouldering B-CLL patients. A statistically significant difference was found between smouldering B-CLL and controls for sCD14 only. sIL2R and sICAM-1 levels directly correlated with total tumor mass (TTM) score, sCD23 with both TTM score and lymphocytosis, and sCD14 with IgG serum values. sIL2R and sCD23 levels lowered significantly after chemotherapy, but only sCD23 and TTM variations after chemotherapy were closely correlated. CONCLUSIONS: sCD23 may be considered the only indicator of tumor mass, while the other soluble factors can be released through different mechanisms. In particular, sICAM-1 seems to correlate with the ability of the tumor to spread, while the sCD14 increase could indicate a role for this soluble factor in preventing infections in B-CLL patients.","['Callea, V', 'Morabito, F', 'Luise, F', 'Piromalli, A', 'Filangeri, M', 'Stelitano, C', 'Iacopino, P', 'Nobile, F', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Callea V', 'Morabito F', 'Luise F', 'Piromalli A', 'Filangeri M', 'Stelitano C', 'Iacopino P', 'Nobile F', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Centro Trapianti di Midollo Osseo, Reggio Calabria, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/physiopathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgE/blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 Jul-Aug;81(4):310-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A flow cytometric analysis.,302-9,"BACKGROUND: Fas antigen (Ag) has recently been identified as the putative surface molecule capable of transducing apoptotic signals into cells. Alterations in the expression of proto-oncogene bcl-2 have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By employing a monoclonal antibody to bcl-2 protein (124 clone) and to Fas Ag (UB2 clone) the expression of these molecules was analyzed at flow cytometry on bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients suffering from different lymphoid and myeloid leukemic diseases (27 acute non-lymphocytic leukemia [ANLL]; 14 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]; 19 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]; 2 Ph1+ chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]; one CD8+ T-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders). Results were compared with those observed on normal PB leukocytes and BM B-cell precursors from patients with non-neoplastic hematological disorders. RESULTS: Fas Ag was constitutively expressed by both monocytes and neutrophils, while lymphocytes expressed bcl-2 with no difference between B and T cell subsets. Interestingly, bcl-2 expression was always absent on neutrophils. When dealing with ANLL patients, a relatively low bcl-2 and high Fas Ag phenotype characterized subtypes with granulocytic (M2) or promyelocytic (M3) differentiation. This observation was confirmed in a small number of patients for whom bcl-2 levels were quantified as antibody binding capacity (ABC) in molecules/cell. Leukemic cells from patients with ALL constitutively expressed bcl-2, the pattern of this expression being quantitatively lower than that of immature B-cell precursors. Finally, high bcl-2 and low Fas Ag expression represented a crucial part of the B-cell CLL immunophenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Although based on a small number of patient and control samples, our results suggest that bcl-2 and Fas Ag are coordinately expressed on normal PB leukocytes. Fas Ag is expressed at low levels on B-CLL cells, generally considered long-surviving cells. The relatively lower bcl-2-expression detected in both M2 and M3 subtypes may explain, at least in part, the higher remission rates obtained in these forms of ANLL than in other less differentiated morphological variants.","['Molica, S', 'Mannella, A', 'Dattilo, A', 'Levato, D', 'Iuliano, F', 'Peta, A', 'Consarino, C', 'Magro, S']","['Molica S', 'Mannella A', 'Dattilo A', 'Levato D', 'Iuliano F', 'Peta A', 'Consarino C', 'Magro S']","['Divisione di Ematologia.

All patients were treated for leukaemia with full doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy and, in each case, a functioning renal allograft was preserved throughout the treatment despite attenuation of immunosuppressive therapy. Three patients achieved complete remission. Of the three, one is surviving at 2 years and two expired during the pancytopenic phase of their treatment with no active leukaemia present, and with intact renal function. As increasing expertise in the field of organ transplantation allows patients to survive longer, such patients' exposure to immunosuppressive and potentially leukaemogenic drugs is prolonged. The risk of secondary neoplasia has been previously documented in this population. Two of the four cases reported here suffered from polycystic kidney disease as their underlying condition. While this report suggests that the leukaemias are related to renal transplantation, we cannot rule out an association with the underlying disease which led to the transplant. This report further suggests that the leukaemia that develops in such patients may respond to standard therapy, and that such treatment does not compromise the transplanted kidney.","['Subar, M', 'Gucalp, R', 'Benstein, J', 'Williams, G', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Subar M', 'Gucalp R', 'Benstein J', 'Williams G', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Medicine, North Central Bronx Hospital, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02988836 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 1996 Mar;13(1):9-13. doi: 10.1007/BF02988836.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Family history revealed a mild aggregation of adult cancers in one generation, and an unusual clustering of brain tumours of early childhood in the following generation. In order to evaluate the genetic basis for cancer predisposition in this family, molecular genetic analysis for the occurrence of germline TP53 tumour suppressor gene mutations was performed on 12 siblings of two generations. Indirect mutation analysis was performed by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Alterations were characterised by automated direct fluorescence sequencing analysis. Tumour material was also examined for p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. Initially, a TP53 gene germline missense mutation was detected in an 11-year-old kindred with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following intensive treatment of a brain tumour. In peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of this proband, a reduction to hemizygosity occurred. During AML treatment, detection of LOH of 17p was used as a marker for clonality and treatment control. The mutation was found to be inherited from the proband's mother, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 48 years. Further, three siblings were carriers, and two are apparently healthy at the age of 21 and 23 years. Knowledge of germline mutations may allow accurate DNA-based carrier diagnosis which is of important clinical significance for treatment strategy and control. Furthermore, the occurrence of unaffected carriers in this family raises questions about appropriate methods of cancer surveillance and counselling for these people.","['Dockhorn-Dworniczak, B', 'Wolff, J', 'Poremba, C', 'Schafer, K L', 'Ritter, J', 'Gullotta, F', 'Jurgens, H', 'Bocker, W']","['Dockhorn-Dworniczak B', 'Wolff J', 'Poremba C', 'Schafer KL', 'Ritter J', 'Gullotta F', 'Jurgens H', 'Bocker W']","['Gerhard-Domagk-Institute of Pathology, Westfalische-Wilhelms-University, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(96)00104-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(96)00104-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Jul;32A(8):1359-65. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(96)00104-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we list and characterize the rare variants of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as (1) clinical, histological and immunological variants of mycosis fungoides; (2) progressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (P-CTCL) including transformed classical cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (TC-CTCL) and primary progressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (PP-CTCL); (3) angiocentric and angioimmunoblastic cutaneous T-cell lymphomas; (4) large cell anaplastic, CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; (5) HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL); (6) cutaneous manifestations of primary extracutaneous T-cell neoplasias; (7) unclassifiable cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.","['Goerdt, S', 'Trautmann, C', 'Kutting, B', 'Ramaker, J', 'Schmuth, M', 'Thiel, E', 'Luger, T', 'Stein, H', 'Orfanos, C E']","['Goerdt S', 'Trautmann C', 'Kutting B', 'Ramaker J', 'Schmuth M', 'Thiel E', 'Luger T', 'Stein H', 'Orfanos CE']","['Hautklinik und Poliklinik, Freie Universitat Berlin.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Hautarzt,"Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete",0372755,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sezary Syndrome/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001050050384 [doi]'],ppublish,Hautarzt. 1996 Feb;47(2):96-105. doi: 10.1007/s001050050384.,,68,,,,,,,,,,Seltene Varianten kutaner T-Zell-Lymphome.,,,,,,

A febrile episode was defined as a temperature of 38 degrees C or greater for at least 6 hours. The number of febrile episodes was 64. The average was 2.2 febrile episodes per patient. Seventy-two percent of febrile episodes occurred when the patients had neutropenia below 100/microliters, while 16% occurred with neutropenia of 101/microliters to 500/microliters. Causative microorganisms were identified in 48% of total febrile episodes. The most common infectious site was the urinary tract which accounted for 25% of total episodes. Pneumonia and septicemia accounted for 22% of total episodes, respectively. Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 66% of microbiologically documented febrile episodes, while 21% were caused by gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococcus aureus, coagulae-negative staphylococcus and enterococci increased compared with a decade ago in our department.

The toxic effects of UpI and the crude extract from which it was isolated have been investigated on three tumour cell lines: KB, L1210, and HEL 299 cells. UpI, however, was less potent on each cell line than the crude extract. Since previous experiments had shown extracts of U. piscivora to be haemolytic on erythrocytes of rat, guinea pig and dog, the haemolytic action of UpI was investigated. It was found to be a potent haemolysin on erythrocytes of rat, guinea pig, dog, pig and human, causing haemolysis on erythrocytes of each species tested at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M. Haemolysis was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the phospholipid sphingomyelin but not cholesterol. Using scanning electron microscopy, it is now being shown that UpI produces significant structural damage to membranes of erythrocytes from rat and guinea pig. It proved to be a potent ichthyotoxin. These data suggest that sea anemone toxin not only possess different pharmacological activities but that UpI, one of the active constituents, could be responsible for the different pharmacological effects exhibited by the crude extract.","['Cline, E I', 'Wiebe, L I', 'Young, J D', 'Samuel, J']","['Cline EI', 'Wiebe LI', 'Young JD', 'Samuel J']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Cnidarian Venoms)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (UPI protein, sea anemone)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/pharmacology', 'Cnidarian Venoms/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Dogs', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Fishes', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Marine Toxins/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Sphingomyelins/pharmacology', 'Swine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(05)80020-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1043-6618(05)80020-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 1995 Nov;32(5):309-14. doi: 10.1016/s1043-6618(05)80020-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential for drainage of vector particles to regional lymph nodes was indicated by experiments showing that intramuscular injection of fluorescein-labeled latex beads concentrated in the regional lymph nodes in mice.

Exposure to these 3-MC doses for 5 d before transient transfection of HTLV-I LTR-CAT construct into these cells markedly stimulated CAT activity, indicating that 3-MC exerted its effect by a trans-acting mechanism. A similar stimulation was observed when this construct was transfected into 3-MC treated uninfected Jurkat cells, indicating that this trans-acting effect was independent of the viral tax protein. However, although the subtoxic 3-MC dose increased also the capacity of SLB-I cells to transmit the virus to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes in coculture, the toxic dose strongly reduced this capacity. No inhibition by this toxic dose was observed in the viral protein synthesis or processing nor in the final release of the virus from the cells. However, the virions released under the influence of this 3-MC dose were found to contain mainly the uncleaved gag precursor polypeptide and a low level of reverse transcriptase. Thus, the reduced virus transmission capacity of the host cells can be ascribed to this structural defect, which presumably lowered the viral infectivity.","['Revazova, T', 'Dombrovsky, A', 'Lochelt, M', 'Flugel, R M', 'Aboud, M']","['Revazova T', 'Dombrovsky A', 'Lochelt M', 'Flugel RM', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Mol Biol Res,Cellular & molecular biology research,9316986,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Gene Products, env/analysis/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/genetics/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Methylcholanthrene/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection', 'Virion/chemistry/enzymology', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Res. 1995;41(5):377-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alterations are classified into two groups. One is the chimeric gene formation, and the other is the aberrant expression without structural changes. The former type is associated with the chromosomal translocations found in acute myeloid leukemia, such as the AML1/MTG8 in t(8;21) and PML/RAR alpha in t(15;17). The latter is the main mechanism in the gene activations observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. Many transcription factor genes are activated by the recombination with the immunoglobulin genes in B cell malignancies or T cell receptor genes in T cell malignancies. We isolated the AML1/EVI-1 fusion gene generated by the t(3;21) translocation, which is usually found in blastic crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia. The chimeric transcription factor encoded by the fusion gene has dual functions, namely differentiation block and stimulation of proliferation.

In populations, MTX resistance was detectable after 1 treatment and increased in degree as total cycles increased to 7. Defective MTXGn synthesis in populations was the only resistance mechanism detected, and FPGS activity in extracts decreased with treatment cycle. After 1 treatment, defective MTXGn synthesis was the major (27/48 clones) form of resistance; 18 clones were sensitive, while 1 clone with a DHFR-related change, no clones with decreased MTX uptake, and 2 complex phenotypes were observed. Sporadic clones with DHFR-mediated resistance appeared up to cycle 4, but defective MTXGn synthesis remained the major resistance mechanism. The degree of clonal resistance tended to increase with treatment cycle, but 1 clone in cycle 2 was similar to the clones from cycle 7. No change in FPGS gene copy number or restriction pattern, or FPGS mRNA level or size (2.3 Kb) was detected in populations.

KPTA5 cells are 9-fold resistant to paclitaxel and taxotere, but do not exhibit significant resistance to Vinca alkaloids, etoposide, anthracyclines, antimetabolites, or alkylating agents. Doubling time and morphology were similar to the parental K562 cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) analysis revealed no alterations in the expression of the mdr1 and MRP genes. Cellular paclitaxel accumulation was unchanged. Cell cycle analyses showed that at 20 nM there was a significantly higher proportion of K562 cells blocked in G2/M, in comparison with KPTA5 cells. In both cases, disruption of the mitotic spindles and the presence of multiple mitotic asters were comparable but occurred at lower paclitaxel concentrations in K562 cells than in KPTA5 cells. There was no difference in total tubulin content between K562 and KPTA5 cells as analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-beta-tubulin monoclonal antibody. However, we found that KPTA5 cells presented a 2-fold increase both in 5 beta-tubulin mRNA expression and in the corresponding tubulin protein Class IV isotype content, as evaluated by rt-PCR and immunostaining. In conclusion, the KPTA5 cell line displays a novel mechanism of resistance to paclitaxel which does not involve altered cellular drug accumulation. The data presented suggest that alterations in expression of the 5 beta-tubulin gene may be involved in paclitaxel resistance.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Dumontet, C', 'Derry, W B', 'Duran, G', 'Chen, K G', 'Tsuchiya, E', 'Wilson, L', 'Jordan, M A', 'Sikic, B I']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Dumontet C', 'Derry WB', 'Duran G', 'Chen KG', 'Tsuchiya E', 'Wilson L', 'Jordan MA', 'Sikic BI']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Tritium', 'Tubulin/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(10-11):517-27.,,,"['CA-52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay relies on the detection of cytokeratin 19 (K19) RNA by nested primer PCR followed by annealing to a (32P)-labeled internal sequence probe and autoradiography. In reconstitution experiments, this assay is capable of detecting 10 fg of admixed mammary tumor RNA in 1 microgram of normal marrow RNA (a dilution of 1:10(7)). Thirty of 30 primary breast tumor specimens, 19 of 19 cytologically positive bone marrow aspirate specimens, and three of 11 aspirate negative/biopsy positive specimens showed detectable K19 transcript. This assay shows high specificity, with 50 of 52 negative control aspirates showing no detectable amplification product. False-positive amplification was noted in two of 18 aspirates obtained from patients with active chronic myelogenous leukemia. Of stage II and III postsurgical breast carcinoma patients with histologically negative bone marrows and no radiographic bone disease, 14 of 30 were K19 positive by PCR. RT-PCR analysis of K19 transcript is a highly sensitive and specific method of detecting and monitoring low-level metastatic disease in patients with primary carcinoma of the breast. The presence of K19 RNA in histologically negative bone marrows suggests that this assay may prove a powerful monitor for patients undergoing curative therapy as well as a novel prognostic indicator.","['Moscinski, L C', 'Trudeau, W L', 'Fields, K K', 'Elfenbein, G J']","['Moscinski LC', 'Trudeau WL', 'Fields KK', 'Elfenbein GJ']","['Department of Pathology, H.

(Pflugers Arch 413:553-558, 1989). The method involves suspending cells loaded with pH-sensitive dyes, such as SNARF-1 or BCECF, in defined mixtures of the weak acid butyric acid and the weak base trimethylamine. Only the uncharged forms of these agents freely permeate the plasma membrane. The weak acid donates protons intracellularly, whereas the weak base accepts them. In accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when cells are exposed to these mixtures, the steady-state pHi is displaced, and the fluorescence signal reflects this new pHi. The null point method described by Eisner et al. derives pHi by determining the molar ratio of acid to base that produces no change in fluorescence signal. In this paper, we show that it is not necessary to obtain the true null point, because a calibration curve can be derived from ""pseudo null"" values whose pHi is defined by the equation pHi = pHe -0.5 log [(AT)/(BT)], where pHe is the extracellular pH, and (AT) and (BT) are the total concentrations of weak acid and base in the suspension. We refer to this as the ""pseudo null calibration method."" It is rapid, technically simple, and reproducible. Compared with the widely used nigericin calibration method, it is not influenced by the intracellular potassium concentration; therefore, it may give a more reliable estimate of the absolute value of pHi.","['Chow, S', 'Hedley, D', 'Tannock, I']","['Chow S', 'Hedley D', 'Tannock I']","['Department of Pathology, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)']",IM,"['*Acid-Base Equilibrium', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Intracellular Fluid/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<360::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<360::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1996 Aug 1;24(4):360-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<360::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunometric assays have shown that alterations in NM-associated functions and morphological characteristics may occur as a result of changes in NM composition. Recent evidence suggests that detection of quantitative or qualitative changes in nuclear matrix protein (NMP) composition may be useful in the diagnosis of cancer and as a reliable indicator of cell death. We have developed an in situ flow cytometric technique for the simultaneous detection of specific NMPs and DNA content in fixed, permeabilized cells. Illustrative results from two different applications of these methods involving two different cell lines (human melanoma and promyelocytic leukemia) are presented, including: 1) measurements of NM breakdown in necrotic and apoptotic cells after treatment with the cytotoxic agents camptothecin, etoposide, or hyperthermia; and 2) detection of changes in NMP content immediately after heat shock. We demonstrate that the technique is useful for the identification of cell-cycle specificity of NM breakdown and allows correlations to be made between the kinetics of DNA fragmentation and NMP solubilization. Furthermore, our studies indicate that flow cytometric detection of changes in NM composition may be useful for identifying different modes and temporal patterns of cell death. We discuss other potential applications of the technique and advantages over standard biochemical assays.","['Dynlacht, J R', 'Henthorn, J', ""O'Nan, C"", 'Dunn, S T', 'Story, M D']","['Dynlacht JR', 'Henthorn J', ""O'Nan C"", 'Dunn ST', 'Story MD']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Fragmentation/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescence', 'Hot Temperature', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Tissue Fixation/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<348::AID-CYTO6>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<348::AID-CYTO6>3.0.CO;2-B [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1996 Aug 1;24(4):348-59. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<348::AID-CYTO6>3.0.CO;2-B.,,,['CA62209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At RT in combination with agitation, there was an increase in signal rates compared to baseline values, probably due to binding of CD34 antibodies to myeloid or non-viable cells (+ 9.2% [BD] and 11.2% [IT]). At a storage temperature of +4 degrees C, CD34+ events did not decrease significantly (-0.7% [BD] and -0.2% [IT]).

Results showed that activation of peroxynitrite synthesis in macrophages was accompanied by the transcriptional activation of iNOS and HO-1 genes. Both genes seem to be activated simultaneously upon activation of the macrophages. Simultaneous activation of iNOS and HO-1 genes may be important because degradation of heme by HO-1 is one of the most important reaction that produces CO in higher organisms, and nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) can react with heme-containing guanylate cyclase.","['Kurata, S', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Yamashita, U']","['Kurata S', 'Matsumoto M', 'Yamashita U']","['Department of Biochemical Genetics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '26404-66-0 (peroxynitric acid)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/*genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitrates/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021392 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1996 Jul;120(1):49-52. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a multivariate model, only duration of neutropenia was significantly associated with development of complicated infection (P = 0.006). Thus, 27% of patients with refractory leukemia or lymphoma treated with AuBMT or PSCT developed complicated infections and 9% died of infection. Prolonged neutropenia was significantly associated with development of infection.

First remission (P = 0.001), a higher cell dose (P = 0.011), ALL (P = 0.023), and a short remission-transplant interval (P = 0.023) were associated with faster platelet recovery. There was a strong correlation between blood cell grafts and higher cell doses, and marrow and lower cell doses.

Platelet recovery was faster in first remission patients (P = 0.005) and ALL (P = 0.043), and with higher cell doses (P = 0.031). We conclude that hematologic recovery after autografting is faster in ALL and first remission patients, probably due to the nature and the amount of prior chemotherapy. Using blood stem cells hastens engraftment, but even if marrow is used due to concern over relapse with blood, higher cell doses are associated with faster recovery.","['Mehta, J', 'Powles, R', 'Horton, C', 'Treleaven, J', 'Singhal, S']","['Mehta J', 'Powles R', 'Horton C', 'Treleaven J', 'Singhal S']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Aug;18(2):319-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) remains the most common hematologic disorder for which splenectomy is therapeutic. A variety of thrombocytopenias are improved by splenectomy. The myeloproliferative disorders constitute a spectrum of disease potentially improved by splenectomy, but preoperative management should be modified in this group.

Folate and methotrexate analogues 6 and 4, with L-histidine in place of L-glutamate, were designed and synthesized as potential FPGS inhibitors. Target compound 5, the N tau-(carboxymethyl)-L-histidine derivative of 4, was also prepared. Compounds 4 and 5 inhibited the growth of L1210 cells (IC50 values: 0.091 and 0.15 microM, respectively) and were potent inhibitors of L1210 dihydrofolate reductase. No significant inhibition of FPGS by 4, 5, or 6 was observed at the high pH of the standard enzyme assay. This could be the consequence of a lack of protonation of the basic side chains, which is likely to be required for FPGS inhibitory activity. The observed cytotoxicity indicates that partial protonation of the imidazole ring permits cellular uptake of the analogues.","['Mao, Z', 'Pan, J', 'Kalman, T I']","['Mao Z', 'Pan J', 'Kalman TI']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, State University of New York at Buffalo 14260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Histidine/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1996/10/11 00:00,1996/10/11 00:01,['1996/10/11 00:00'],"['1996/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm960250j [doi]', 'jm960250j [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Oct 11;39(21):4340-4. doi: 10.1021/jm960250j.,,,"['CA35212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High frequency of expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia.,1105-10,"CD79 alpha is a subunit of an intracytoplasmic protein reported to be specific for B lymphocytes, including immature B lineage cells. To evaluate expression of the CD79 alpha antigen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we studied forty-eight cases of AML by paraffin section immunohistochemistry. The cases included four MO, nine M1, nine M2, ten M3, ten M4, and six M5 AMLs using criteria of the French-American-British cooperative group. Eleven cases demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for the CD79 alpha antigen, including one M1, nine M3, and one M5 AML. These CD79 alpha-positive cases represented 5% of all non-promyelocytic AMLs and 90% of all acute promyelocytic leukemias studied. All acute promyelocytic leukemias had the characteristic t(15;17)(q24;q21), including two cases of the microgranular variant (M3v). No other B-lineage-associated antigens were found in the CD79 alpha-positive cases, with the exception of a subpopulation of CD19-positive leukemic cells in one patient. The two non-promyelocytic leukemias that expressed CD79 alpha had no evidence of t(15;17) and did not express any additional B-lineage-associated antigens that might suggest a mixed lineage proliferation. This study demonstrates that CD79 alpha expression in acute leukemia is not restricted to B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias and that CD79 alpha expression is frequently associated with t(15;17) acute myeloid leukemia.","['Arber, D A', 'Jenkins, K A', 'Slovak, M L']","['Arber DA', 'Jenkins KA', 'Slovak ML']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Oct;149(4):1105-10.,PMC1865171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AlPc showed the best photocytotoxicity leading to 0.008 surviving fraction at 2 x 10(-9) M for TF-1 and 4 x 10(-9) M for Daudi. A1 5 x 10(-7) M, SiPc and PcHEX induced a significant photokilling, whereas NiPc and PcPHE were inactive. Laser flash photolysis and photoredox properties of the phthalocyanines were investigated to try to relate these parameters with the biological effects. AlPc showed the longest triplet life-time: 484 microseconds in dimethyl sulfoxide/H2O. This value was increased up to 820 microseconds when AlPc was complexed with human serum albumin used as a membrane model. Such an enhancement was not observed with the silicon phthalocyanines. Upon irradiation, all the phthalocyanines generated singlet oxygen with 0.29-0.37 quantum yield values. The reduction potentials of the excited states obtained from measurement in the ground state and energy of the excited triplets show that AlPc is the best electron acceptor.

Pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells are most influenced by IL-3, GM-CSF, and stem cell factor while committed progenitor cells are regulated by variable concentrations of GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-5, Epo, and Tpo. As a result of their common origin, a key point to remember about myeloproliferative disorders is the involvement of multiple cell lines in dysplastic and neoplastic conditions. Dysplastic changes may signal early neoplastic changes with cases progressing to acute leukemia. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is associated with anemia or multiple cytopenias, normal to hypercellular bone marrow, ineffective hematopoiesis, and less than 30% blast cells of all nucleated cells in the bone marrow. Chronic myeloid leukemias also have less than 30% blast cells of all nucleated cells in the bone marrow and are distinguished from MDS by elevated cell counts of one or more cell lines with mature forms predominating. Acute myeloid leukemias, often the end result of all myeloproliferative disorders, are recognized by equal or greater 30% blast cells of all nucleated cells in the bone marrow. Additional diagnostic information from cytochemical stains, immunohistochemical staining, and cytogenetic analysis can influence the final diagnosis when morphology alone is equivocal. In conclusion, prognosis and response to treatment are best determined by application of a uniform set of standards in evaluating hematolymphatic neoplasia. Critical to diagnosis are complete blood and bone marrow evaluations including observation for dysplastic changes and blast cell quantitation. In addition, evidence for tissue infiltration identified through cytologic or histologic evaluations of lymph node, spleen, or liver is recommended.","['Raskin, R E']",['Raskin RE'],"['Department of Physiological Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,The Veterinary clinics of North America.

The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for detecting disseminated yeast infection were, respectively, 88 and 91% per patient (upper limit of normal, 4.00). Seventy-one percent of patients already expressed elevated values at the onset of empiric antifungal therapy. The diagnosis of disseminated infection was confirmed on average 21.7 days after the first elevation of the D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol ratio. The method contributes to diagnosis of disseminated yeast infection and helps in monitoring patients at risk, to support the initiation of antifungal therapy at an early stage of the disease.","['Lehtonen, L', 'Anttila, V J', 'Ruutu, T', 'Salonen, J', 'Nikoskelainen, J', 'Eerola, E', 'Ruutu, P']","['Lehtonen L', 'Anttila VJ', 'Ruutu T', 'Salonen J', 'Nikoskelainen J', 'Eerola E', 'Ruutu P']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Turku University, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Sugar Alcohols)', 'YFV05Y57M9 (arabitol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Candidiasis/*diagnosis/urine', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sugar Alcohols/*urine']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.34.9.2175-2179.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1996 Sep;34(9):2175-9. doi: 10.1128/jcm.34.9.2175-2179.1996.,PMC229212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis revealed that the EP4 gene is expressed at a high level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and at lower levels in cultured human blood cell lines, THP-1 and U937 (monocytoid cell lines), MOLT-4 and Jurkat (T-cell lines), and Raji (B-cell line). To examine regulation of the EP4 gene expression in the immune system, we studied the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on these cell lines. Gene expression was upregulated in THP-1, U937, and Raji cells by PMA, and was downregulated in MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells. In THP-1 cells the effects of PMA were further analyzed, and the upregulation of the EP4 gene was shown to be followed by an increase in PGE2 binding sites and in PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation. In the striking contrast, other PGE receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2 and EP3) and other prostanoid receptors (IP and DP) were shown not to be upregulated by PMA. Therefore, this is the first demonstration of a highly specific upregulation of the EP4 subtype in THP-1 cells treated with PMA, suggesting the importance of the EP4 subtype in the immune system. In the present study we also clarified that EP4 gene expression is regulated differently among human monocytoid and lymphoid lineage cells, thus leading to the better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for the human EP4 gene expression in the immune system.","['Mori, K', 'Tanaka, I', 'Kotani, M', 'Miyaoka, F', 'Sando, T', 'Muro, S', 'Sasaki, Y', 'Nakagawa, O', 'Ogawa, Y', 'Usui, T', 'Ozaki, S', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Narumiya, S', 'Nakao, K']","['Mori K', 'Tanaka I', 'Kotani M', 'Miyaoka F', 'Sando T', 'Muro S', 'Sasaki Y', 'Nakagawa O', 'Ogawa Y', 'Usui T', 'Ozaki S', 'Ichikawa A', 'Narumiya S', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/classification/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00207510 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1996 Jun;74(6):333-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00207510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technique can be applied to identify the individual origin of cells and thus analyze the hemopoietic chimerism that eventually results in leukemic patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In the current study, results of REISD with different REs are shown. In particular, the use of Sau 3A reveals a polymorphism for constitutive heterochromatin of chromosome 3 and may differentiate BMT donor (D) and recipient (R) cells. Once pre-BMT characterization shows a different Sau 3A digestion pattern of D and R cells, it is possible to monitor the development of hematopoietic cell populations in the R bone marrow after BMT. A panel of 24 patients who underwent BMT and their Ds were analyzed. The method presented here allowed cells from D and R to be distinguished, and therefore to quantify the post-BMT hemopoletic chimerism, in 6 (25%) of the cases. This quantitative and sex-independent genetic approach to the study of hemopoietic chimerism has already shown itself to be useful in patients with leukemia who require a BMT, but could also be extended to other transplant situations.","['Diez-Martin, J L', 'Buno, I', 'Lopez-Fernandez, C', 'Fernandez, M N', 'Polo, N', 'Gosalvez, J']","['Diez-Martin JL', 'Buno I', 'Lopez-Fernandez C', 'Fernandez MN', 'Polo N', 'Gosalvez J']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Restriction Mapping/*methods', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Sep;24(11):1333-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed this proliferating activity of MS-5-conditioned medium (CM) on human primitive hematopoietic cells. When Lin-CD34+CD38- cells of normal human cord blood cells were co-cultured with MS-5, colony forming cells (CFCs) were maintained over 7 weeks in vitro. Prevention of contact between MS-5 and Lin-CD34+CD38- cells by using membrane filter (0.45 micron) was negligible for this activity. This indicated that the activity of MS-5 on human primitive hematopoietic cells is a soluble factor(s) secreted from MS-5, which is not induced by the contact between MS-5 and Lin-CD34+CD38- cells. We tried to purify this soluble activity. An active material with a molecular weight of about 150 kDa, determined by gel filtration chromatography, solely supported the growth of Lin-CD34+CD38- cells and Mo7e, a human megakaryocytic cell line. This activity not only reacted with anti-mouse stem cell factor (mSCF) antibody on Western blots, but it was also neutralized in the presence of anti-mSCF antibody. Another active material with a molecular weight of about 20-30 kDa synergized with mSCF to stimulate the growth of Lin-CD34+CD38- cells but failed to do so alone, although this synergy was inhibited in the presence of soluble mouse granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (mG-CSF) receptor, which is a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of mG-CSF receptor and the Fe region of human IgG1. In addition, the latter molecule supported the growth of the G-CSF dependent cell line FD/GR3, which is a murine myeloid leukemia cell line, FDC-P2, transfected with mG-CSF receptor cDNA. Adding of anti-mSCF antibody and soluble mG-CSF receptor to the culture completely abrogated the activity of MS-5-CM. Recombinant (r) mSCF and rmG-CSF had synergistic activity on the growth of Lin-CD34+CD38- cells.

This gave a mean stimulation index of 2.73 (95% CI 2.42-3.05) and 50/54 (93%) of donors gave responses that were greater than those with bcr or abl control peptides. The mean stimulation index relative to that of the control peptides was 1.80 (95% CI 1.63-1.97; p < 0.001). Responses were optimal at concentrations ranging from 0.3-150 micrograms/mL and in most cases peaked at 9 days. There was no clear relationship between level of responsiveness to the b3a2 fusion peptide and the presence of any single HLA-A, -B, -DR, or -DQ allele. HIA-DRB1*0404 was the only allele that was not associated with responsiveness.

The MRP mRNA level in HL-60/R-CP cells increased remarkably after a 24-h incubation with 20 microM cisplatin; interestingly, however, no amplification of the MRP gene was detected. In cisplatin-sensitive HL-60 cells, which express the MRP/GS-X pump at low levels, c-myc expression was substantially suppressed by delta(7)-PGA1 methyl ester and the cell cycle was arrested in G1 phase. By contrast, in HL-60/R-CP cells overexpressing the MRP/GS-X pump, c-myc expression and cell proliferation were much less affected by delta(7)-PGA1 methyl ester. This suggests that induction of the MRP/GS-X pump may confer on cancer cells resistance to anticancer prostaglandins and that the resistance mechanism may involve the increased efflux of PG-glutathione conjugates, as active intermediates, from the cells via the MRP/GS-X pump.","['Akimaru, K', 'Kuo, M T', 'Furuta, K', 'Suzuki, M', 'Noyori, R', 'Ishikawa, T']","['Akimaru K', 'Kuo MT', 'Furuta K', 'Suzuki M', 'Noyori R', 'Ishikawa T']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

We have described a 110 kD protein termed the Lung Resistance-related Protein (LRP) that is overexpressed in several non-Pgp MDR cells lines of different histogenetic origin. Reversal of MDR parallels a decrease in LRP expression. In a panel of 61 cancer cell lines which have not been subjected to laboratory drug selection, LRP was a superior predictor for in vitro resistance to MDR-related drugs when compared to Pgp and MRP, and LRP's predictive value extended to MDR unrelated drugs, such as platinum compounds. LRP is widely distributed in clinical cancer specimens, but the frequency of LRP expression inversely correlates with the known chemosensitivity of different tumour types. Furthermore, LRP expression at diagnosis has been shown to be a strong and independent prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian carcinoma (platinum-based treatment) patients. Recently, LRP has been identified as the human major protein. Vaults are novel cellular organelles broadly distributed and highly conserved among diverse eukaryotic cells, suggesting that they play a role in fundamental cell processes. Vaults localise to nuclear pore complexes and may be the central plug of the nuclear pore complexes. Vaults structure and localisation support a transport function for this particle which could involve a variety of substrates. Vaults may therefore play a role in drug resistance by regulating the nucleocytoplasmic transport of drugs.","['Izquierdo, M A', 'Scheffer, G L', 'Flens, M J', 'Shoemaker, R H', 'Rome, L H', 'Scheper, R J']","['Izquierdo MA', 'Scheffer GL', 'Flens MJ', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Rome LH', 'Scheper RJ']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', 'Organelles/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00744212 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 1996;19(3):191-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00744212.,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PCNA binding domain maps to amino acid residues 481-728 and is conserved in all five subunits of RF-C. The PCNA binding domain of RF-Cp145 inhibits several functions of RF-C, such as: (i) in vitro DNA replication of SV40 origin-containing DNA; (ii) RF-C-dependent loading of PCNA onto DNA; and (iii) RF-C-dependent DNA elongation. The PCNA binding domain of RF-Cp145 localizes to the nucleus and inhibits DNA synthesis in transfected mammalian cells. In contrast, the DNA binding domain of RF-Cp145 does not inhibit DNA synthesis in vitro or in vivo. We therefore conclude that amino acid residues 481-728 of human RF-Cp145 are critical and act as a dominant negative mutant of RF-C function in DNA replication in vivo.","['Fotedar, R', 'Mossi, R', 'Fitzgerald, P', 'Rousselle, T', 'Maga, G', 'Brickner, H', 'Messier, H', 'Kasibhatla, S', 'Hubscher, U', 'Fotedar, A']","['Fotedar R', 'Mossi R', 'Fitzgerald P', 'Rousselle T', 'Maga G', 'Brickner H', 'Messier H', 'Kasibhatla S', 'Hubscher U', 'Fotedar A']","['Institut de Biologie Structurale J.-P.

Mutations in the p53 gene are infrequent in this disease and, hence, variable protein expression in the majority of the samples cannot be accounted for by mutation. In this study, we examined the regulation of p53 gene expression in human leukemic blasts and characterized the p53 transcripts in these cells. We found control both at the level of RNA abundance and at the level of translation. Four experiments point towards translational control of human p53 gene expression. First, there is no correlation between the level of p53 mRNA and the level of p53 protein expression in blast cells. Second, in two cell lines with similar levels of p53 protein expression but with different levels of p53 mRNA, we find that there is preferential association of p53 mRNA with large polysomes in the cells with less p53 RNA. Third, translation of synthetic human p53 transcripts in cell-free extracts is inhibited by the p53 3'UTR. Fourth, the p53 3'UTR, when present in cis, can repress translation of a heterologous transcript. These observations raise the possibility that human p53 mRNA translation may be regulated in vivo by RNA binding factors acting on the p53 3'UTR.","['Fu, L', 'Minden, M D', 'Benchimol, S']","['Fu L', 'Minden MD', 'Benchimol S']","['The Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Aug 15;15(16):4392-401.,PMC452163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By means of sequential immunoprecipitation of chromatin using anti-Max and anti-Myc antibodies, we have identified a Myc-regulated gene and genomic sites occupied by Myc-Max in vivo. Four of 27 sites recovered by this procedure corresponded to the highest affinity 'canonical' CACGTG sequence. However, the most common in vivo binding sites belonged to the group of 'non-canonical' E box-related binding sites previously identified by in vitro selection. Several of the genomic fragments isolated contained transcribed sequences, including one, MrDb, encoding an evolutionarily conserved RNA helicase of the DEAD box family. The corresponding mRNA was induced following activation of a Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein (Myc-ER) in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, consistent with this helicase gene being a direct target of Myc-Max. In addition, as for c-Myc, the expression of MrDb is induced upon proliferative stimulation of primary human fibroblasts as well as B cells and down-regulated during terminal differentiation of HL60 leukemia cells. Our results indicate that Myc-Max heterodimers interact in vivo with a specific set of E box-related DNA sequences and that Myc is likely to activate multiple target genes including a highly conserved DEAD box protein. Therefore, Myc may exert its effects on cell behavior through proteins that affect RNA structure and metabolism.","['Grandori, C', 'Mac, J', 'Siebelt, F', 'Ayer, D E', 'Eisenman, R N']","['Grandori C', 'Mac J', 'Siebelt F', 'Ayer DE', 'Eisenman RN']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (Max protein, rat)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/*physiology', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Aug 15;15(16):4344-57.,PMC452159,,"['R01CA20525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/X98743', 'GENBANK/X99150', 'GENBANK/X99151', 'GENBANK/X99152', 'GENBANK/X99153', 'GENBANK/X99154', 'GENBANK/X99155', 'GENBANK/X99156', 'GENBANK/X99157', 'GENBANK/X99158', 'GENBANK/X99159', 'GENBANK/X99160', 'GENBANK/X99161', 'GENBANK/X99162', 'GENBANK/X99163', 'GENBANK/X99164', 'GENBANK/X99165', 'GENBANK/X99166', 'GENBANK/X99167', 'GENBANK/X99168', 'GENBANK/X99380']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several transcription factors, including WT1 and PAX8, are expressed early in nephrogenesis and play a key role in this process. The expression of PAX8 occurs in the induced mesenchyme of the developing kidney prior to the upregulation of WT1 levels in the same cells. In this report, we assessed whether the Pax-8 gene product resides upstream of wt1 in a common regulatory pathway. Transfection studies, as well as gel-shift assays, indicate that PAX8 transactivates wt1 through elements within a 38 bp conserved motif, present in human and murine promoters. Two PAX8 isoforms, generated by alternative splicing at the C-terminus and previously thought to lack transactivation potential, were found to be capable of activating wt1 expression. We also demonstrate that the endogenous wt1 promoter can be upregulated by exogenously supplied PAX8, suggesting that a function of PAX8 during mesenchymal--epithelial cell transition in renal development is to induce wt1 gene expression.","['Dehbi, M', 'Pelletier, J']","['Dehbi M', 'Pelletier J']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX8 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX8 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pax8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Epithelial Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mesoderm/cytology', 'Mice', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'PAX8 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Aug 15;15(16):4297-306.,PMC452155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An additional single mutation at position +3 of Tyr344 led to the replacement of leucine 347 by proline. Stimulation by Epo induced an impaired activation of the STAT5 transcription factor in these cells. The same defect in STAT5 activation was found in the murine FDCP-1 cell line transfected with a chimeric EpoR containing the abnormal TF-1 EpoR cytoplasmic domain. Infection of TF-1 cells with a retrovirus containing a normal murine EpoR was able to restore both Epo-induced STAT5 activity and cellular proliferation.

Various approaches were tested and compared. Among 30 informative samples, 11 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, not otherwise specified (NOS), 5 ductal carcinomas in situ, 5 lobular carcinomas, 3 papillary carcinomas, and 6 benign lesions were studied. Of the 11 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinomas (NOS) analyzed, four cases showed 3 signals, one case showed 4 signals, and the rest showed 2 signals. Of the 5 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ samples, 1 showed 3 signals and the other 4 cases showed 2 signals. All cases of lobular carcinomas, papillary carcinomas, and benign lesions showed 2 signals. We inferred from these data that 36% of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas (NOS) were trisomic and 9% were tetrasomic, whereas 20% of the ductal carcinomas in situ were trisomic. All samples from lobular carcinomas, papillary carcinomas, and the benign lesions were disomic. From our preliminary data, it can further be concluded that a subset of breast cancer is characterized by chromosome 8 trisomy. These data are consistent with an ever-increasing database on the association of chromosomal 8 trisomy with other cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, ovarian carcinoma, salivary gland tumor, malignant melanoma, desmoid tumors, and recently gestational trophoblastic disease. It is also noted that the ability to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material will enable a more comprehensive cytogenetic study of breast cancer than is currently available.","['Afify, A', 'Bland, K I', 'Mark, H F']","['Afify A', 'Bland KI', 'Mark HF']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics, FISH and Genotoxicology, Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cats', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polyploidy', 'Specimen Handling/*methods']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01806674 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 1996;38(2):201-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01806674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rarity of this association suggests that leukemic cells may have certain properties or features that may lead to the development of glomerulonephritis. Effective medical treatment of the leukemia may not necessarily allow regression of the nephrotic syndrome; however, the effects of splenectomy on nephrotic proteinuria when associated to chronic lymphocytic leukemia have never been evaluated. We report the case of a 50-year-old male with stage C CD5+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia associated with a nephrotic syndrome due to Type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Chlorambucil and prednisone were unable to control the leukemia and the nephrotic range proteinuria, and were discontinued because of poor hematologic tolerance. A splenectomy immediately resulted in a spectacular remission of both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the nephrotic syndrome. Spleen lymphocytes were collected and tested in quantitative flow cytometry for the expression of the main B cell associated markers. They did not exhibit any particular immunophenotypic pattern. This report of a remission of a glomerulonephritis associated with chronic leukemia following splenectomy is evidence of a possible relationship between the two diseases.","['Halimi, J M', 'Lavabre-Bertrand, T', 'Beraud, J J', 'Canaud, B']","['Halimi JM', 'Lavabre-Bertrand T', 'Beraud JJ', 'Canaud B']","['Service de Reanimation chez des Maladies Metaboliques, Hopital Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Clin Nephrol,Clinical nephrology,0364441,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative/drug therapy/*etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/drug therapy/*etiology/*surgery', '*Splenectomy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Nephrol. 1996 Apr;45(4):273-6.,,19,,,,['Clin Nephrol. 1997 Feb;47(2):131-3.

TPMT catalyzes the formation of methylthioinosine monophosphate (MetIMP), which is cytotoxic for cultured cell lines, and it plays a role in detoxification of 6MP. Population studies show a genetic polymorphism for TPMT with both high and low activity alleles. About 1 of 300 subjects is homozygous for the low activity. The function TPMT plays in detoxification or therapeutic efficacy of 6MP in vivo is not clear. In this article the genetic polymorphism of TPMT is reviewed and the contribution of TPMT to the cytotoxic action, or detoxification, of 6MP in children with ALL is discussed. Induction of TPMT activity has been described during the treatment for ALL. We performed a pilot study on the influence of high-dose 6MP infusions (1300 mg/m2 in 24 h) on TPMT activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pMNC) of eleven patients with ALL. The TPMT activities were in, or, above the normal range. There was no statistically significant difference between the TPMT activities before and after the 6MP infusions. MetIMP levels in pMNC increased during successive courses. This might be explained by TPMT induction, but other explanations are plausible as well. Twenty five percent of the TPMT assays failed, because less than the necessary 5.10(6) pMNC could be isolated from the blood of leukopenic patients. Red blood cells can not be used for TPMT measurements, since transfusions are frequently required during the treatment with 6MP infusions. Therefore, the influence of high-dose 6MP infusions on TPMT activity can only be investigated further when a TPMT assay which requires less pMNC has been developed.","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen, C W', 'Leegwater, P A', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Lambooy, M A', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'Trijbels, J M']","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen CW', 'Leegwater PA', 'De Abreu RA', 'Lambooy MA', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Trijbels JM']","['Center for Pediatric Oncology SE Netherlands, St Radboud University Hospital, Nijmegen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Biomed Appl,"Journal of chromatography.

SETTING - A follow up study in 1994 of all live births with a cytogenetic diagnosis of trisomy 21 or related karyotype born in 1989 and diagnosed in the South East Thames and Oxford Regional Health Authorities; these amounted to 100 children. RESULTS - Eighteen of the sample of 100 had died in the first three years, and seven were reported as adopted. Fifty six mothers were interviewed, including five of children who had died. High rates of associated congenital defects were reported. The most common were congenital heart defects, which were reported for 29 of the 69 children for whom health information was available, and were certified as the underlying cause of death of 12 and required surgery in 11. At least five children had had gastrointestinal atresia or other gut blockage, most presenting at birth but one case occurring at 3 years, and these had necessitated a colostomy in two cases. Leukaemia had occurred in two children, both of whom had died. As expected mothers also reported high rates of defects of hearing, often treated with grommets; of vision; and frequent severe infections. CONCLUSIONS - Information of this nature, as well as that regarding the more positive aspects of Down's syndrome, should be made available to those counselling parents considering the offer of diagnostic tests.","['Brookes, M E', 'Alberman, E']","['Brookes ME', 'Alberman E']","[""Department of Environmental and Preventive Medicine, The Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Screen,Journal of medical screening,9433359,,IM,"['Adoption', 'Cause of Death', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*epidemiology/mortality', 'England', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/complications/epidemiology', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Hearing Disorders/complications/epidemiology', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications/epidemiology', 'Morbidity', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vision Disorders/complications/epidemiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/096914139600300104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Screen. 1996;3(1):7-11. doi: 10.1177/096914139600300104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: Group 1 consisted of 16 patients (10 boys) with a hematologic malignancy, mostly leukemia, conditioned for BMT with total body irradiation (TBI), 7.5 to 12 Gy, and cyclophosphamide. Group 2 consisted of 14 patients (9 boys) with severe aplastic anemia, conditioned with chemotherapy only. RESULTS: In group 1, patients achieved a reduced final height after BMT. The difference between the height standard deviation score (SDS) at BMT and the height SDS at final height was -1.96 (0.82) SDS in boys and -0.92 (0.71) SDS in girls (p = 0.0001, and p = 0.02 respectively). Final height was also lower than target height (boys, p = 0.01; girls, p = 0.03). Prepubertal growth in the first 3 years after BMT was normal but pubertal height gain was decreased. The patients in group 2 achieved normal height. Thyroid function and adrenal function were normal in all patients, and no growth hormone deficiency was detected. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone values after BMT were increased in all group 1 patients, with return to normal in two patients. Serum luteinizing hormone values were increased in all group 1 girls, with recovery in one girl. Normal serum luteinizing hormone values and spontaneous puberty were found in all group 1 boys. In group 2, disturbances in gonadotropins were seen only in three boys and two girls. CONCLUSION: In patients treated in childhood with BMT after chemotherapy and TBI with 7.5 Gy or more, final height is compromised because of blunted growth in puberty. Patients who had not received TBI suffered no height loss.

These alterations include increases in the levels of the neuropeptides, galanin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and substance P (SP) and a decrease in the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Previous studies have indicated that after axotomy in vivo, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role in increasing the contents of galanin and VIP in the SCG. In the present study, by examining the time courses of the changes in LIF and neuropeptide mRNA and by using LIF null mutant mice, we have determined that LIF alters neuropeptide content in part by increasing levels of peptide mRNA. In addition, LIF also makes a small contribution to the axotomy-induced down-regulation of mRNA encoding TH and neuropeptide Y, both of which are normally expressed at high levels in the SCG. Finally, by using a LIF-blocking antiserum, this cytokine was found to regulate SP expression in an in vitro axonal injury model. Thus, after axotomy, a single factor, LIF, participates in the down-regulation of peptides/proteins involved in normal neurotransmission and the up-regulation of a group of neuropeptides normally not present in the SCG that may be involved in regeneration.","['Sun, Y', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Sun Y', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4975, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Galanin/*biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Immune Sera', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/enzymology/*physiology', 'Neuropeptide Y/*biosynthesis', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/enzymology/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/*biosynthesis', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*biosynthesis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67041751.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1996 Oct;67(4):1751-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67041751.x.,,,"['MH00162/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS12651/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In placenta, the HLA-G gene produces several alternatively spliced isoforms encoding bound-membrane proteins (G1, G2, G3 and G4) lacking, respectively, exon 7; exons 7 and 3; exons 7, 3 and 4, and exons 7 and 4. In addition, two isoforms (G1s and G2s) containing an intron 4 sequence are able to encode soluble antigens. We have recently reported that the HLA-G gene is transcriptionally active in lymphocytes and is not transcribed in CD34+ cells, polynuclear cells or monocytes. To investigate the functional significance of the different isoforms in lymphocytes, we studied their distribution in normal T and B lymphocytes and in malignant lymphoid cells by using the RT-PCR technique followed by hybridization with exon-specific probes and sequencing assays. In transcriptionally active lymphocytes, the HLA-G primary transcript is the major form and is differentially spliced in B and T lymphocytes: (i) G1s is found in several samples of T and B cells whereas G2s is only transcribed in T lymphocytes, (ii) the G4 isoform is never detected in B lymphocytes. In addition, we have shown that HLA-G is inactive in some samples of lymphocytes. Our data suggest that HLA-G transcription is regulated at the initiation level and at the subsequent splicing. These two levels of regulation may be dysregulated in some cases of T-ALL and CLL. The potential functions of the HLA-G alternative forms in lymphocytes, such as peptide binding and modulation of the immune response, are discussed.","['Amiot, L', 'Onno, M', 'Drenou, B', 'le Marchand, B', 'Lamy, T', 'Semana, G', 'Fauchet, R']","['Amiot L', 'Onno M', 'Drenou B', 'le Marchand B', 'Lamy T', 'Semana G', 'Fauchet R']","['University Laboratory for Hematology and Biology of Blood Cells, University of Rennes I, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Immunogenet,European journal of immunogenetics : official journal of the British Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics,9106962,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', '*RNA, Messenger', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1744-313x.1996.tb00127.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunogenet. 1996 Aug;23(4):311-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-313x.1996.tb00127.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have applied serial-thin sectioning and stereology to quantitatively characterize the three-dimensional organization of ER export sites in vivo and in vitro. We find that ER buds in vivo are nonrandomly distributed, being concentrated in regional foci we refer to as export complexes. The basic organization of an export complex can be divided into an active COPII-containing budding zone on a single ER cisterna, which is adjacent to budding zones found on distantly connected ER cisternae. These budding foci surround and face a central cluster of morphologically independent vesicular-tubular elements that contain COPI coats involved in retrograde transport. Vesicles within these export complexes contain concentrated cargo molecules. The structure of vesicular-tubular clusters in export complexes is particularly striking in replicas generated using a quick-freeze, deep-etch approach to visualize for the first time their three-dimensional organization and cargo composition. We conclude that budding from the ER through recruitment of COPII is confined to highly specialized export complexes that topologically restrict anterograde transport to regional foci to facilitate efficient coupling to retrograde recycling by COPI.","['Bannykh, S I', 'Rowe, T', 'Balch, W E']","['Bannykh SI', 'Rowe T', 'Balch WE']","['Scripps Research Institute, Department of Cell Biology, La Jolla, California 92130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (SAR1 protein, S cerevisiae)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Coated Vesicles/chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Freeze Etching/methods', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/ultrastructure', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Envelope/ultrastructure', 'Rats', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.135.1.19 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Oct;135(1):19-35. doi: 10.1083/jcb.135.1.19.,PMC2121027,,"['CA 586689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 42336/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither the expression of Ras GAP mRNA nor p120 GAP protein was downregulated by the antisense oligonucleotide, suggesting a non-antisense mechanism for growth inhibition. The antisense oligonucleotide contained GGC triplets which have previously been reported to inhibit the activity of p210bcr-abl both in vitro and in vivo. However, cellular phosphotyrosine levels were found to be unaffected, suggesting that the activity of p210bcr-abl was normal and that the antisense oligonucleotide may be interacting aptamerically with a different cellular protein.

Leukaemic children in whom ASP Medac was administered at 3 d intervals in a two-step dose reduction (5000 IU/m2, n = 10; 2500 IU/m2, n = 15) were compared with children who had received Bayer ASP 10,000 IU/m2 in the same time schedule in a former randomized trial; at the same venipuncture, blood samples for coagulation studies were obtained before each ASP administration together with serum samples for pharmacokinetic monitoring. Compared with Bayer ASP 10,000 IU/m2, patients receiving Medac ASP 5000 IU/m2 showed significantly decreased values of fibrinogen, plasminogen, and alpha 2-antiplasmin, along with significantly enhanced thrombin generation. Improvement occurred in children treated with 2500 IU/m2 Medac ASP; alpha 2-antiplasmin and D-dimer no longer differed from the Bayer group. Since both patient groups showed complete asparagine depletion during the course of ASP administration, the lower dosage of 2500 IU/m2 administered at 3 d intervals should guarantee the specific metabolic therapy for ALL, leading to depletion of the circulating pool of asparagine.","['Nowak-Gottl, U', 'Ahlke, E', 'Schulze-Westhoff, P', 'Boos, J']","['Nowak-Gottl U', 'Ahlke E', 'Schulze-Westhoff P', 'Boos J']","['University Hospital Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Factor V/genetics', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Plasminogen/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/metabolism']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1873.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Oct;95(1):123-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1873.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of sensitivity of currently employed RT-PCR methods may therefore be explained by their poor yield of PML-RAR alpha cDNA.

In the case of autonomous proliferators, rhMIP-1 alpha had no inhibitory effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation and in 4/6 cases [3H]-thymidine incorporation was stimulated by rhMIP-1 alpha. In the presence of stem cell factor (SCF), a majority (8/9) of the samples which responded to this growth factor were inhibited when rhMIP-1 alpha was included in the assay medium. Similar results were obtained with GM-CSF-responsive samples; however, when these two cytokines were combined, only 3/14 were significantly inhibited. In the presence of human placental conditioned medium (HPCM), rhMIP-1 alpha significantly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation in only 2/10 of HPCM-responsive samples. In methylcellulose assays rhMIP-1 alpha had no consistent effect on colony/cluster formation in the presence of either GM-CSF + SCF or HPCM. Similar results were obtained with BB-10010, a mutant of rhMIP-1 alpha which has defined aggregation properties in solution.

The current study aims at adding to this approach by detecting differences in the intracellular metabolism of AraC 5'-triphosphate (AraCTP) between leukemic and normal mononuclear blood cells. Measurements of intracellular AraCTP levels were complemented by determinations of plasma AraC and arabinoside uridine (AraU) concentrations and were performed in 26 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were undergoing combination therapy, including high-dose (1.0 or 3.0 g/m2 x 2/day) AraC. Plasma AraC concentrations showed a linear relationship to the applied AraC dose but did not correlate with intracellular AraCTP levels. Substantial differences in AraCTP retention times were revealed, during 3-h infusions of either 1.0 or 3.0 g/m2 AraC in leukemic blasts from 10 patients with t1/2 values of 1.60-7.63 h (median, 2.42 h). In addition, AraCTP levels declined in only one patient by > 10% within the first hour after the end of therapy and remained constant or even increased up to 1.5-fold during a posttreatment period of 1-2.5 h in the other nine cases. In contrast, AraCTP retention times were relatively uniform in normal mononuclear blood cells from 11 patients, with t1/2 values of 3.34-5.29 h (median, 3.85 h). More importantly, AraCTP levels dropped by > 10% within the first hour after the end of the high-dose AraC infusion in eight of 11 cases. A posttherapeutic increase of > 10% was not observed in any patient. These differences in AraCTP pharmacokinetics between leukemic and normal blood cells provided the basis for a modified timing of AraC administration with the aim of selectively maintaining cytotoxic AraCTP levels in leukemic blasts while allowing an intermittent drop of AraCTP levels in normal cells. This modification may result in higher antileukemic activity without increasing the damaging effect on normal cells and may, thus, improve the therapeutic index for AraC.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Schleyer, E', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Kern, W', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Schleyer E', 'Unterhalt M', 'Kern W', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Hematology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*blood', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/*blood', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007691-199608000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 1996 Aug;18(4):341-9. doi: 10.1097/00007691-199608000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dynamics of the disease are dramatically different in no-risk, low-risk and high-risk subpopulations of asocial, free roaming, and multiple cat household cats. Among low risk (<1% prevalence) free roaming cats, the model predicts that an effective immunization rate of 4% year-1, or an effective removal rate of 8% year-1 are adequate to control the disease completely. Under higher risk (10% prevalence) conditions, an effective immunization rate of 23-72% year-1 or a removal rate of 69-145% year-1 are required for control. At very high (30%) prevalence rates, even heroic measures may not suffice to substantially reduce disease prevalence: a vaccination rate of 100% year-1 even if attainable, would only slightly reduce disease prevalence from 30% to 29%. We conclude that the current estimated effective feline leukemia virus immunization rate of 11-19% of the general population is inadequate to provide herd immunity in the subpopulation of cats which are genuinely at risk of infection.

Even late in the 19th century, however, there remained considerable confusion between mild smallpox and chickenpox. The name varicella itself is an irregular diminutive form of variola. Yet, early in the 20th century, detailed histologic studies began to differentiate the exanthems. The investigation of the varicella vesicle by Tyzzer 90 years ago remains a classic example (see Fig. 2). Although the pathogenesis of varicella vaccine virus infection appears to mimic that of wt VZV infection, a vaccine virus-related exanthem is more common in immunized children with an underlying immunosuppressive condition, such as leukemia, than in normal children. Those immunized children who never develop a rash presumably have an abrogated infection in which the host immune response has eliminated the virus prior to a major viremic spread. There may be a correlation between the presence of an exanthem and the ability of an immunized child to spread the varicella vaccine virus. The differences in capsid structure and assembly may explain in part the attenuation of the vaccine strain. Because the majority of varicella vaccine virus particles in the nucleus have aberrant cores lacking an electron-dense center, they are never enveloped. Therefore, they do not become infectious virions. In a recent article, Grose et al applied the technique of three-dimensional (3-D) computer modeling in an attempt to reconstruct an aberrant VZV capsid with the hubcap or pinwheel core. Each 3-D model was then sliced by computer to obtain a series of two-dimensional models that represented the images commonly seen by traditional electron microscopy. The 3-D model that best represented the capsid with a pinwheel core contained particulate matter in each of the 12 vertices of the icosahedral capsid (Fig. 14). This model strongly suggested that VZV may form in the nucleus an intermediary or end-stage capsid with an aberrant distribution of assembly protein or viral DNA within its core. Herpes simplex viral particles with pinwheel cores are rarely seen in cell culture, so this type of aberrant capsid appears to be associated mainly with VZV replication. Thus, the strategy of Takahashi and colleagues to serially passage the varicella vaccine virus in human embryonic lung cells, guinea pig embryo cells, and Wistar Institute strain 38 (WI-38) cells may have exploited in as yet unknown ways the profound cell-associated nature of VZV to achieve an end product with attenuated pathogenic potential.","['Grose, C']",['Grose C'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Infectious disease clinics of North America,8804508,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Chickenpox/*virology', '*Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Cytoplasm/virology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/growth & development/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5520(05)70310-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5520(05)70310-x [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Dis Clin North Am. 1996 Sep;10(3):489-505. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5520(05)70310-x.,,27,['AI36884/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study focuses on the quantitation of resistance to increasing doses of 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) by using hematological tumors expressing different levels of bcl-2. Scanning densitometry of Western blots demonstrated that the myeloid U-937 cells express low levels of bcl-2 (RD = 0.008), whereas the follicular lymphoma RL-7 expressed very high levels (RD = 3.084). Colony formation was also examined following incubation with Ara-C and RL-7 cells demonstrated a higher clonogenic survival (LD50 = 0.5 microns) when compared with U-937 cells (LD50 = 0.005 microM). Similarly, the level of bcl-2 expression in each cell line was also related to apoptosis with U-937 cells demonstrating increased DNA fragmentation when compared with RL-7 cells. To further evaluate the effect of upregulated bcl-2 on Ara-C treatment, U-937 cells were transfected with a retroviral vector carrying the murine bcl-2 or vector alone. Upregulation of bcl-2 by myeloid leukemic cells increased the resistance by 3 logs to Ara-C when comparing LD50 values from clonogenic assays, and decreased apoptosis by at least 3 logs when measuring dUTP positive cells by flow cytometry.","['Guedez, L', 'Suresh, A', 'Tung, F', 'Zucali, J']","['Guedez L', 'Suresh A', 'Tung F', 'Zucali J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01353.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Aug;57(2):149-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01353.x.,,,['AI 24705/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first principle is that interphase chromosomes occupy discrete territories in the nucleus, with no intermingling of the DNA from different chromosomes. Within a chromosome territory the DNA is organized in chromatin fibers at several levels of folding, that meander through the territory. Transcription and replication take place at the surface of these higher order chromatin fibers, probably on locally unfolded DNA templates. The second principle is that different types of nuclear domains are associated with several specific gene loci. This holds for clusters of interchromatin granules, coiled bodies, RNA 3'-cleavage factor-containing nuclear bodies (cleavage bodies) and probably PML-containing nuclear bodies. These domains may play an important role in the spatial arrangement of genes in the interphase nucleus. Despite these new insights, our knowledge of the function of many nuclear compartments and the molecular interactions responsible for the dynamic organization of a compartmentalized nucleus is still in its infancy.","['de Jong, L', 'Grande, M A', 'Mattern, K A', 'Schul, W', 'van Driel, R']","['de Jong L', 'Grande MA', 'Mattern KA', 'Schul W', 'van Driel R']","['E.C.

In contrast, normal quiescent human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBL) are devoid of PDE1 activity [Epstein, P. M., Moraski, S., Jr., and Hachisu, R. (1987) Biochem. J. 243, 533-539]. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we show that the mRNA encoding the 63-kDa form of PDE1 (PDE1B1) is expressed in RPMI-8392 cells, but not in normal, resting HPBL. This mRNA is, however, induced in HPBL following mitogenic stimulation by phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Also using RT-PCR, the full open reading frame for human PDE1B1 cDNA was cloned from RPMI-8392 cells and it encodes a protein of 536 amino acids with 96% identity to bovine, rat, and mouse species. RT-PCR also identifies the presence of PDE1B1 in other human lymphoblastoid and leukemic cell lines of B- (RPMI-1788, Daudi) and T-(MOLT-4, NA, Jurkat) cell origin. Inhibition of PDE1 or PDE4 activity by selective inhibitors induced RPMI-8392 cells, as well as the other cell lines, to undergo apoptosis. Culture of RPMI-8392 cells with an 18-bp phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, targeted against the translation initiation region of the RPMI-8392 mRNA, led to a specific reduction in the amount of PDE1B1 mRNA after 1 day, and its disappearance after 2 days, and induced apoptosis in these cells in a sequence specific manner. This suggests that PDEs, particularly PDE1B1, because its expression is selective, may be useful targets for inducing the death of leukemic cells.","['Jiang, X', 'Li, J', 'Paskind, M', 'Epstein, P M']","['Jiang X', 'Li J', 'Paskind M', 'Epstein PM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '29925-17-5 (4-(3-Butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone)', '543512OBTC (vinpocetine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE1B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Pde1b protein, rat)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*physiology"", '4-(3-Butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/physiology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rolipram', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.20.11236 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 1;93(20):11236-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.20.11236.,PMC1074519,,,['GENBANK/U56976'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have examined amphotropic retrovirus receptor (amphoR) and ecotropic retrovirus receptor mRNA expression in highly purified populations of mouse and human HSC. Murine HSC with low to undetectable levels of amphoR mRNA and relatively high levels of ecotropic retrovirus receptor mRNA were studied. When these HSC were analyzed simultaneously for ecotropic and amphotropic retrovirus transduction, ecotropic provirus sequences were detected in 10 of 13 long-term repopulated animals, while amphotropic proviral sequences were detected in only one recipient. A second distinct population of murine HSC were isolated that express 3-fold higher levels of amphoR mRNA. When these HSC were analyzed simultaneously for ecotropic and amphotropic retrovirus transduction, 11 of 11 repopulated mice contained ecotropic provirus and 6 of 11 contained amphotropic provirus sequences, a significant increase in the amphotropic retrovirus transduction (P = 0.018). These results indicate that, among the heterogeneous populations of HSC present in adult mouse bone marrow, the subpopulation with the highest level of amphoR mRNA is more efficiently transduced by amphotropic retrovirus. In a related study, we found low levels of human amphoR mRNA in purified populations of human HSC (CD34+ CD38-) and higher levels in committed progenitor cells (CD34+ CD38+). We conclude that the amphoR mRNA level in HSC correlates with amphotropic retrovirus transduction efficiency.","['Orlic, D', 'Girard, L J', 'Jordan, C T', 'Anderson, S M', 'Cline, A P', 'Bodine, D M']","['Orlic D', 'Girard LJ', 'Jordan CT', 'Anderson SM', 'Cline AP', 'Bodine DM']","['Hematopoiesis Section, National Center for Human Genome Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4442, USA. dorlic@nchgr.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', '*Symporters', '*Transduction, Genetic']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.20.11097 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 1;93(20):11097-102. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.20.11097.,PMC38290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the enhancer is accessible in multipotential cell chromatin but functionally incompetent before granulocyte commitment. Multipotential cells contain both Pu1 and C-EBP alpha as enhancer-binding activities. Pu1 is unphosphorylated in both multipotential and granulocyte-committed cells but is phosphorylated in B lymphocytes, raising the possibility that differential phosphorylation may play a role in specifying its lymphoid versus myeloid functions. C-EBP alpha exists as multiple phosphorylated forms in the nucleus of both multipotential and granulocyte-committed cells. C-EBP beta is unphosphorylated and cytoplasmically localized in multipotential cells but exists as a phosphorylated nuclear enhancer-binding activity in granulocyte-committed cells. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced granulocytic differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells results in activation of C-EBP delta expression and functional recruitment of C-EBP delta and C-EBP beta to the nucleus. Our results implicate Pu1 and the C-EBP family as critical regulators of myeloperoxidase gene expression and are consistent with a model in which a temporal exchange of C-EBP isoforms at the myeloperoxidase enhancer mediates the transition from a primed state in multipotential cells to a transcriptionally active configuration in promyelocytes.","['Ford, A M', 'Bennett, C A', 'Healy, L E', 'Towatari, M', 'Greaves, M F', 'Enver, T']","['Ford AM', 'Bennett CA', 'Healy LE', 'Towatari M', 'Greaves MF', 'Enver T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Trans-Activators']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.20.10838 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 1;93(20):10838-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.20.10838.,PMC38242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulmonary GVHD and pulmonary aspergillosis were also observed. Various etiologic factors have been implicated in PVOD after BMT. We postulate that pulmonary GVHD and pulmonary infection including aspergillosis played an important role in the occurrence of both PVOD and HUS in our patient. Microangiopathic cytokines released in response to the GVHD and infection may damage the intima of microvessels that were previously injured by the two BMT.

To identify the clonal component, the NK cell fraction was sorted from the mononuclear layer and was subjected to Southern blot hybridization with a probe for EB virus tandem repeats. The fraction was also stimulated with interleukin-2 and the level of interferon-gamma in the conditioned medium was measured. Levels of M-CSF and interferon-gamma were significantly correlated with the degree of clinical manifestations and laboratory data.

IL-4 production was not increased in the carriers except for one with a past history of toxoplasma lymphadenitis. IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha levels were higher in the carriers. CD4+ cells were responsible for the enhanced IFN-gamma production, while monocytes were responsible for the increased IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha production. The present study showed that the PBMCs from HTLV-I carriers consistently produced large amounts of some cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha) but not of other cytokines (IL-4).

Human telomeric DNA consists of 2-15 kb of a tandemly repeated sequence (TTAGGG)n, oriented 5'-3' toward the end of the chromosome. The evolutionary conservation of this repetitive DNA sequence implies that the sequence is essential to cellular function. These repeated sequences are synthesized by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, telomerase, which is composed of an essential RNA and a few proteins. Human telomerase has been proposed to be repressed in somatic tissues, and human telomeres become shorter during somatic development and with increasing age. Telomeres in tumors are even shorter, and loss of telomeric DNA during tumorigenesis may contribute to the genome instability associated with transformed cells.

The mechanism of this regulation is not yet clear. Thus, the regulation by intracellular calcium requires elucidation. We studied the gamma-TcR gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line DND41 (CD4- CD8-) by Northern blot and flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA levels of gamma-TcR increased by ionomycin, anti-CD3, and with TPA. TPA had an antagonistic effect to both ionomycin and anti-CD3. Also, TPA inhibits the increased intracellular calcium promoted by ionomycin but not the increase promoted by anti-CD3 and ionomycin. Our results suggest that intracellular calcium induces mRNA and protein expression of gamma-TcR chain. This effect is antagonized by protein kinase C-activation. Thus, we conclude that the target cells of the differential regulation on gamma-TcR mRNA expression by intracellular calcium modulators are the CD4- CD8- cells, and this is due to cytosolic calcium mobilization.","['Peralta-Zaragoza, O', 'Martinez-Valdez, H', 'Madrid-Marina, V']","['Peralta-Zaragoza O', 'Martinez-Valdez H', 'Madrid-Marina V']","['Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Muromonab-CD3/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1996 Autumn;27(3):305-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To isolate cDNA transcripts associated with FX-induced leukemia in C57BL/6 mice, a cDNA library was constructed from FX-induced thymoma mRNA and differentially screened with cDNA probes. A novel cDNA transcript, FX-induced transcript 1 (FXI-T1), showed strong differential mRNA expression in all C57BL/6 FX-induced thymomas examined when compared with normal thymus tissue. FXI-T1 was not universally expressed in proliferative or other neoplastic cells. Expression of FXI-T1 mRNA in untreated mouse organs was not restricted to the thymus; highest expression was observed in brain and skeletal muscle tissue. The translated FXI-T1 sequence encodes a basic, prolinerich protein that contains a RING-H2-finger motif. The COOH-terminal region of the putative FXI-T1 protein has sequence similarity with the COOH-terminal domain of the Drosophila deltex protein, a component of a signal pathway that functions during cell differentiation. The described observations suggest an association of FXI-T1 with FX-induced leukemogenesis. The study of FXI-T1 should contribute to an understanding of the processes of T-cell differentiation and regeneration in addition to leukemogenesis.","['Pampeno, C L', 'Meruelo, D']","['Pampeno CL', 'Meruelo D']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016, USA. pampeco1@mcrcr.med.nyu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Dtx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Library', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thymoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Aug;7(8):1113-23.,,,"['A-22247/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-31346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/H45727', 'GENBANK/R06577', 'GENBANK/T05200', 'GENBANK/U38252']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamins are known to be degraded during apoptosis. PARP is a substrate for the Yama protease, which is encoded by the CPP32 beta/ Yama gene, whereas lamins are degraded by the Yama and lamin proteases. In the present studies, we determined the effects of enforced overexpression of the antiapoptosis Bcl-xL protein on taxol-mediated microtubule and cell cycle perturbations, as well as on taxol-induced apoptosis and associated Yama protease activity in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Our data demonstrate that high Bcl-xL levels do not affect the microtubular bundling or mitotic arrest due to taxol but significantly inhibit the morphological, flow cytometric, and DNA fragmentation features associated with taxol-induced apoptosis. This resulted in a significant improvement in the survival of taxol-treated cells that possess high Bcl-xL levels. In the control HL-60 cells, following taxol treatment, whereas the mRNA of Yama was not induced, taxol-induced apoptosis was associated with Yama activation and PARP as well as lamin B1 degradation. These features were blocked by coculture of these cells with the cysteine protease inhibitor YVAD-cmk as well as in cells with overexpression of Bcl-xL. These results suggest that Bcl-xL antagonizes taxol-induced apoptosis by a mechanism that interferes with the activation of a key protease involved in the execution of apoptosis.","['Ibrado, A M', 'Huang, Y', 'Fang, G', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ibrado AM', 'Huang Y', 'Fang G', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (lamin B1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/physiology', 'Humans', '*Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Microtubules/physiology', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Aug;7(8):1087-94.,,,"['CA56613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors analyzed 1,155 peripheral blood samples from CML patients, for which there were same day Ph data, to determine if there was a correlation between bcr-abl protein levels and the percentage of Ph. A ratio of bcr-abl protein (P210 or P185) to normal abl protein (P145), the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all blood cells, has been established as a criterion for quantitating bcr-abl levels. The bcr-abl/abl protein ratio from 399 patient who were 100% Ph-positive had a mean of 2.47 (standard error [SE] of +/- 0.05); no false negatives were detected. A decreasing ratio was found in patients with decreasing percentages of Ph. The relationship between the ratio of bcr-abl/abl proteins to the percentage of Ph-positive cells was nearly linear in 392 patients with Ph percentages between 5% to 95% (r = 0.97, P < .001). For patients in remission with no detectable Ph, the bcr-abl/abl ratio had a mean of 0.01 (SE = 0 +/- 0.00). The level of bcr-abl expression in samples from peripheral blood and bone marrow also were compared.

Other work revealed that pretreatment of L1210 tumor targets with IFN-gamma rendered them more susceptible to NO-mediated killing by LPS-activated M phi. Now we have combined these observations to determine if pretreatment of L1210 or P815 tumor targets with IFN-gamma and/or IL-2 would augment production of TDRF to enhance M phi activation. Results confirmed that pretreatment of either L1210 or P815 targets with 200 u/ml of IFN-gamma or 1,000 u/ml of IL-2 significantly increased their susceptibility to M phi-mediated cytotoxicity owing to increased NO production. Similar pretreatment of L1210 targets with suboptimal concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in combination resulted in additive rather than synergistic augmentation of NO-mediated cytotoxicity by cytotoxic M phi. Pretreatment of L1210 targets with IFN-gamma or IL-2 alone or in combination increased the production of TDRF above constitutive levels as demonstrated by increased production of NO and induction of NOS mRNA expression by cytotoxic M phi. Thus IFN-gamma and/or IL-2 promoted increased TDRF production by tumor targets which in turn promoted M phi generation of tumor cytotoxic NO. It appears that M phi activating cytokines have a dual role in acting on certain tumor targets to augment the process of M phi activation through the increased elicitation of immunopotentiating tumor-derived soluble factor(s).","['Jiang, H', 'Robinson, W E', 'Leu, R W']","['Jiang H', 'Robinson WE', 'Leu RW']","['Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Noble Centerfor Biomedical Research, Oklahoma City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(96)80008-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(96)80008-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1996 Jan;195(1):91-104. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(96)80008-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vigilance over possible long-term adverse effects of metal prostheses is required. Some of the metal components are potentially carcinogenic. Prolonged contact of metal alloys with body fluids results in gradual corrosion of even the most inert metals. Three cohost studies of persons with a hip prosthesis have been reported; they provide direct, quantitative observations of cancer risk in a human population with hip prosthesis. The design and the results of these studies are similar. Combining the results sharpens the precision of risk estimates. Collectively, the studies examined cancer risk in 40,945 patients followed up for a mean 8.5 years after hip replacement. Overall, the relative risk of cancer was 1.02 (95 percent CI 1.00 to 1.05). There was an 8 percent excess of haemopoietic malignancy (leukaemia and lymphoma), with a total of 347 cases observed (RR 1.08, 95 percent CI 0.97 to 1.20). Significant deficits of cancers of the breast and large bowel were seen in the two smaller studies, but combined results from all three studies suggest the relative risk is close to unity. Cancer risk in the first 10 years after hip replacement was not different from that expected, but there was an excess of borderline statistical significance 10 or more years after surgery, with a relative risk of 1.08 (95 percent CI 1.00 to 1.13) based on 1,005 cases. All three studies were well-designed and executed. Their results are not alarming, but give no cause for complacency, since the number of patients with a prosthesis and the length of time they live with the prosthesis will increase. A register of malignancy complicating joint prosthesis would not help quantify any risk. Instead, a large cohort study of patients with joint prostheses is needed, including information on the type and composition of the prosthesis and on potential confounding exposures for each patient. Measures of corrosion in cancer cases and of tissue levels of relevant metal ions in cases and controls (prosthesis but no cancer) matched for age, sex, and time since insertion would be valuable. Such a study could be done internationally, using orthopedic units with good clinical records for 10 to 15 years in areas with long-term cancer registration.","['Coleman, M P']",['Coleman MP'],"['Epidemiology and Vital Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Hip/surgery', 'Hip Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Joint Prosthesis/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'New Zealand', 'Orthopedic Equipment/*adverse effects', 'Sweden', 'Time Factors']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1996 Mar-Apr;26(2):139-46.,,,['11700/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2 alone or in combination with Interferon-alpha, may intensify remission and prolong disease-free survival when given post autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to patients with lymphoma and myeloid leukemia, and to a lesser degree, to patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL). IL-2 in combination with HLA-matched or mismatched peripheral blood lymphocytes was also used post autologous BMT in preliminary studies.

That characterizing the genetic defect may revolutionize treatment approach and disease outcome has recently been proven in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

The focus of this review is to familiarize the practicing physician with some principles of molecular biology and with its current and future goals with respect to leukemia.","['Paietta, E']",['Paietta E'],"['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01571193 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 1995 Sep;12(3):157-66. doi: 10.1007/BF01571193.,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary target of MTX is the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which catalyzes the reduction of folate and 7,8-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. Understanding of MTX action has revealed how cells acquire resistance to this drug. The four known mechanisms of MTX resistance are a decrease in the uptake of the drug, a decrease in the retention of the drug due to defective polyglutamylation or an increase in polyglutamate breakdown, an increase in the enzyme activity and a decrease in the binding of MTX to DHFR. The molecular basis for some of these mechanisms has been elucidated in MTX resistant cell lines; in particular the occurrence of gene amplification resulting in increased DHFR and point mutations resulting in altered DHFR with reduced affinity for MTX. Cloning of the human folylpolyglutamate synthase gene and the reduced folate transport gene have been reported recently and should facilitate the identification of the molecular basis of these resistant phenotypes. DHFR protein has been shown to regulate its synthesis by exerting an inhibitory influence on its own translation. Addition of MTX relieves this inhibition thus providing a possible molecular explanation for the rapid rise in DHFR activity noted in some cells after MTX administration. Alterations in genes involved in regulating the cell cycle such as cyclin D1 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene have also been shown to influence cellular response to MTX. Overexpression of cyclin D1 in HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line, results in decreased MTX sensitivity. The molecular basis of this observation is under investigation. Abnormalities in the Rb gene may also have profound effects on MTX sensitivity. Rb interacts with the family of transcription factors called E2F reducing transcription of genes that contain E2F binding sites in the promoter regions e.g. DHFR. When Rb is deleted or rendered nonfunctional levels of ""free"" or unbound E2F are high resulting in enhanced transcription of genes such as DHFR. This results in increased DHFR protein and may lead to MTX resistance. As the knowledge regarding mechanisms of resistance increases newer approaches to circumvent such resistance or to target resistant cells can be undertaken.","['Banerjee, D', 'Ercikan-Abali, E', 'Waltham, M', 'Schnieders, B', 'Hochhauser, D', 'Li, W W', 'Fan, J', 'Gorlick, R', 'Goker, E', 'Bertino, J R']","['Banerjee D', 'Ercikan-Abali E', 'Waltham M', 'Schnieders B', 'Hochhauser D', 'Li WW', 'Fan J', 'Gorlick R', 'Goker E', 'Bertino JR']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 1995;42(4):457-64.,,56,"['CA-08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-47179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred and two strains were isolated from 287 patients. Fifty two point three percent of the total isolates were gram-negative bacilli, 26.8% were gram-positive cocci, 17.2% were fungi and 3.6% were anaerobic bacteria. In ALL patients gram-positive cocci accounted for 42.0%. This rate was significantly higher than in other disorder. Additionally, oral mucositis or gingivitis was evaluated as clinical background in 36.1% of ALL cases. Forty-seven point two percent of organisms which caused septicemia in ALL patients were isolated from surveillance cultures of the throat just before the onset of septicemia. These data suggested that in ALL cases microbiological organisms more frequently invaded through injuries of oral mucosa. In ATL, CML, MM and AA patients, fungi accounted for more than 25% of causative organisms. The most common organism of all of the strains was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.9%), but in ATL and MM patients Escherichia coli was more common than P. aeruginosa. At the onset of the septicemia, neutrophil counts were less than 100/mm3 in 76.6% of all patients, and more than 3,000/mm3 in only 5.0%. In contrast to this result, in 66.7% of ATL patients and 37.5% of MM patients, septicemia occurred even when neutrophil counts were more than 3,000/mm3. Septicemia occurred in 28.2% of the total patients but died. The mortality rate in MM and AA patients (50.0% respectively) was higher than in other diseases.

A clear shift toward a lower buffer capacity and a higher amount of cariogenic microorganisms is seen posttransplant.

The binding was prevented when the cells were treated with ADP/Fe3+ in the presence of antioxidants, indicating that oxidation of the cells is responsible for the increased susceptibility to the THP-1 cell binding. Galactose, fucose, mannose and mannan partially inhibited the binding. Glycoproteins containing poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains such as band 3 glycoprotein isolated from human erythrocyte membrane and lactoferrin, and their oligosaccharides, strongly inhibited the binding. On the other hand, glycoproteins with non-poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains such as glycophorin A isolated from the erythrocyte membrane, fetuin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, little or partially inhibited the binding. The inhibitory activity of band 3 oligosaccharides and lactoferrin oligosaccharides was little affected by treatment with endo-beta-galactosidase, which specifically cleaves poly-N-acetyllactosamine to shorter oligosaccharides. Removal of the nonreducing terminal region of the saccharide chains of band 3 on the erythrocyte surface by treatment of the cells with endo-beta-galactosidase resulted in a decrease in the susceptibility of the cells to the THP-1 cell binding. These results suggest that THP-1 cells which have been differentiated into macrophages bind the oxidized erythrocytes primarily through the recognition of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains of band 3, and the site of the recognition exists in the nonreducing terminal region of the saccharide chains. Clustering of band 3 molecules is proposed as a possible alteration of oxidized erythrocyte membrane which promotes the interaction of the saccharide receptor on THP-1 cells with the saccharide chains of band 3 on erythrocytes.","['Beppu, M', 'Eda, S', 'Fujimaki, M', 'Hishiyama, E', 'Kikugawa, K']","['Beppu M', 'Eda S', 'Fujimaki M', 'Hishiyama E', 'Kikugawa K']","['School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '82441-98-3 (poly-N-acetyllactosamine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Lactoferrin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phagocytosis', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.188 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Feb;19(2):188-94. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-LF to THP-1 macrophages indicated that high and low affinity receptor sites (Kd = 0.57 x 10(-6) and 3.7 x 10(-6) M, respectively) are present on the cells. The number of these high and low affinity receptor sites were 2.4 x 10(6), and 2.5 x 10(6) per cell, respectively. Removal of iron from 125I-LF did not affect its binding to THP-1 macrophages, indicating that the binding is not dependent on Fe(III) ion. The binding of the labeled LF to THP-1 macrophages was markedly decreased following acetylation, suggesting that the amino residues of the polypeptide portion of LF play a major role in the binding. The binding of labeled LF was partially inhibited by the isolated whole oligosaccharides of LF, and by the isolated whole oligosaccharides of band 3 glycoprotein of human erythrocyte membrane which contain poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains, like the LF oligosaccharides. Their inhibitory activity did not depend on the terminal sialyl residues of the saccharide chains. Lacto-N-fucopentaose III and lacto-N-neotetraose, an analogous structure being present in the poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl chains of LF, also artially inhibited the binding of 125I-LF to the THP-1 macrophages. When poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains of 125I-LF were cleaved by endo beta-galactosidase, the binding of 125I-LF was partially reduced. These results suggest that binding of LF to THP-1 macrophages is primarily mediated by its protein component, but a short oligosaccharide structure, possibly Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal, which is contained in the nonreducing terminal region of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl saccharide chains of LF and band 3, and in lacto-N-fucopentaose III and lacto-N-neotetraose is also recognized by THP-1 macrophages, and this recognition partly contributes to the binding of LF to cells.","['Eda, S', 'Kikugawa, K', 'Beppu, M']","['Eda S', 'Kikugawa K', 'Beppu M']","['School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,['EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)'],IM,"['Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.167 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Feb;19(2):167-75. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As yet, the mode of their formation remains to be satisfactorily elucidated. In order to characterize these cells, the expression of various markers of epidermal differentiation following UV exposure was investigated using immunhistochemical procedures. These were applied to paraffin-embedded (microwave technique) and frozen specimens of human skin 24 h after irradiation with 4 times the minimal erythema doses(MED). Normal nonirradiated skin without irradiation served as the control. We used a battery of antibodies directed against the following: cytokeratins (CKs) 5, 10, 17, and 19, actin, cell-adhesion proteins (desmoplakins, desmogleins), markers of terminal epidermal differentiation (filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin), markers of proliferation (PCNA, MIB, K6,16), a marker of endocytosis (clathrin) and markers of cell growth, (transforming growth factor [TGF-alpha]) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 [bcl-2]. After UV irradiation it was found that CK 5, which is typically confined to basal keratinocytes, was also expressed in suprabasal keratinocytes. The CKs 1 and 10/11 exhibit a normal suprabasal localization, but suprisingly, SBCs were negative for these CKs. Although CK 6,16, and 17 are not usually found in normal epidermis, UVB exposure induced their expression in suprabasal keratinocytes, but again failed to elicit their expression in SBCs. Antibodies specific for markers of late epidermal differentiation (filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin), cell-junction proteins (desmogleins, desmoplakins), proliferation (PCNA and MIB), and endocytosis (clathrin) also failed to produce positive staining of SBCs. Even though TGF-alpha immunoreactivity became detectable in most keratinocytes after UV exposure, this was not the case for SBCs. The number of basally located dendritic cells, most probably melanocytes, exhibiting bcl-2 staining was markedly reduced 6 and 12 h after irradiation as compared with normal skin. SBCs do not express any late differentiation markers, but they do contain proteins typical of basal keratinocytes (CK 5). It can be concluded that SBCs do not develop beyond a more basal-like differentiation pattern, probably as a result of cell death and migration through the epidermis.","['Bayerl, C', 'Taake, S', 'Moll, I', 'Jung, E G']","['Bayerl C', 'Taake S', 'Moll I', 'Jung EG']","['Department of Dermatology, Mannheim Medical School, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",9013641,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Desmogleins)', '0 (Desmoplakins)', '0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (loricrin)', '60108-77-2 (involucrin)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Clathrin/analysis', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Desmogleins', 'Desmoplakins', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'Epidermis/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Filaggrin Proteins', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/analysis', 'Keratinocytes/pathology', 'Keratins/analysis', 'Melanocytes/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Protein Precursors/analysis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Sunburn/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0781.1995.tb00157.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed. 1995 Aug;11(4):149-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0781.1995.tb00157.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A biopsy carried out on a cutaneous nodule, revealed diffuse dermoepidermic infiltration by immature cells of myeloid lineage, with cellularity and count similar to that of bone marrow and peripheral blood. The karyotype in the peripheral blood was normal. Infectious and immune causes were excluded as well as constitutional illnesses associated with unstable haematopoiesis. The family rejected treatment with chemotherapy and the baby died on day 53 of life due to progressive leukocytosis and concurrent infection.

The former is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean and equatorial Africa; whereas the latter prevails in intravenous drug addicts, being also endemic in American indian populations. Both viruses are either sexually transmitted, from mother to child mainly by breast-feeding, by blood transfusion or by sharing contaminated needles. With regard to transmission, since they are intracellular viruses, it occurs only when whole blood or cellular components are transfused; this is not the case when either plasma or plasma derivatives are used. The likelihood of transmission decreases as the storage time increases. HTLV-I is associated, at least, with two diseases: adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and the tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). ATLL occurs after a latency period of 20 to 30 years; whereas the incubation period ranges from 3 to 5 years in the case of the neurological disease. Most individuals infected with the virus remain healthy; the risk of developing the hematological complication is 2-4% whereas it is below 1% in the case of TSP. No clear association of HTLV-II with any known disease has been reported as yet. In this study, we have assessed the prevalence of HTLV-I and HTLV-II in the sera of the blood donors who have come to our Division, with the aim of avoiding the spreading of this oncogenic virus by transfusion. This study could serve as a measure of the infection in the general population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 28,897 samples were analyzed from May 1993 to January 1995. Anti-HTLV-I/II antibodies were analyzed by the method of passive agglutination of gelatin participles (PA). Samples which reacted were tested again by the same method, and those reacting for the second time were further confirmed by Western blot (WBT), a method with the ability to differentiate between antibodies anti-HTLV-I and anti-HTLV-II. RESULTS: Of the 28,897 samples, 47 were repeatedly reactive by PA (0.16%). Analysis by WBT resulted in 10 reactive results with HTLV-I (0.035%), 2 reactive results with HTLV-II (0.007%); in one sample it could not be determined whether the anti-HTLV-I or anti-HTLV-II antibody was present. Of the remaining samples, 21 were non-reacting, whereas 13 were indeterminated. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of HTLV-I and HTLV-II seropositive blood donors is low and similar to that found in other non-endemic countries. We believe that routine evaluation of anti-HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies in blood donors would be warranted in our country, since transmission of the viruses by transfusion of blood components has been clearly shown. It is possible that the recipients of the reactive units do not develop the disease. Nevertheless, these individuals constitute an important source of virus dissemination, both during the perinatal period and by sexual intercourse. In fact, advise to seropositive donors would prevent transmission by these routes. Lastly, it should be noticed that investigation of anti-HTLV-I/II antibodies could result in a surrogate method for detecting other viral infections transmitted by these routes.","['Blejer, J L', 'Saguier, M C', 'Salamone, H J', 'Carreras, L A']","['Blejer JL', 'Saguier MC', 'Salamone HJ', 'Carreras LA']","['Division Medicina Transfusional, Instituto de Cardiologia y Cirugia Cardiovascular, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agglutination Tests', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Biomarkers', '*Blood Donors', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/*blood', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'HTLV-II Infections/blood/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1995 Dec;40(6):447-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Determinacion de anticuerpos anti HTLV-I/II: experiencia en 28,897 donantes de sangre en Buenos Aires.",,,,,,

Whole cell currents in response to voltage ramps from -125 to +60 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV were recorded in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1 cells) in solutions designed to optimize detection of a Ca2+ current. An inwardly rectifying current could be activated upon dialysis of the cell interior with pipette solutions devoid of Ca2+ and containing 20 mm BAPTA, a procedure expected to passively deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. The current was maximally activated within 2 min, was sensitive to extracellular Ca2+ concentration and was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. The current was markedly reduced in the presence of Ni2+ or La3+. The pathway activated by this protocol was permeant to Ba2+, displaying complex permeability characteristics at negative potentials. A small inward Mn2+ current consistent with a finite permeability of the pathway to Mn2+ was detected. In contrast Ni2+ displayed no detectable current carrying ability. Extracellular Na+ permeated the pathway in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under conditions designed to reduce passive depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, a Ca2+ current indistinguishable from that described above was activated by addition of ionomycin. This observation is consistent with the activation of the Ca2+ influx pathway occurring as a result of events associated with depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Importantly, application of extracellular Ni2+ in the presence of ionomycin irreversibly inhibited the current. The presence of an inwardly rectifying K+ current in RBL cells could confound studies of the capacitative Ca2+ entry current when recorded using pipette solutions devoid of K+ since this current would be inward over the voltage range used to investigate the capacitative Ca2+ entry current. This study compares an inward rectifying K+ current and the capacitative Ca2+ entry current in RBL cells and highlights some similarities and differences between the two currents. The results demonstrate that caution should be exercised in interpreting recordings made using extracellular solutions containing even modest amounts of K+ when studying the capacitative Ca2+ entry current in RBL cells.","['Schofield, G G', 'Mason, M J']","['Schofield GG', 'Mason MJ']","['Department of Physiology, Tulane University Medical School, 1430 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Ion Transport', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002329900125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1996 Oct;153(3):217-31. doi: 10.1007/s002329900125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-one children, between 2 and 16 years of age, were treated from November 1987 to October 1993. Of these, 25 were treated with the BFM 86 protocol (18 non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas and 7 acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemias) and the rest with the BFM 90 protocol (15 non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas and 1 acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia). Complete remission was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A relapse occurred in 12.5% of the cases. Currently, 80.4% remain in continuous complete remission and 17% have died. The 5 year actuarial survival rate of those treated with the BFM 86 and 90 protocols was 79% and 87%, respectively, and event free survival in the same period was 76% and 87%, respectively.

The nucleic acid sequence of interest is amplified using a downstream primer carrying the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The modified primer is incorporated into the amplified DNA, which is subsequently used for RNA probe synthesis in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and a hapten-labeled ribonucleotide (digoxigenin-UTP). As a model, we prepared RNA probes specific for the BCR-ABL mRNA characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The probes are used in time-resolved fluorometric hybridization assays. Mixtures of BCR-ABL positive and negative cells, as well as whole blood samples, are analyzed. The sample mRNA is amplified using a biotinylated upstream primer. The amplified product (target DNA) is captured onto streptavidin-coated wells and hybridized to the RNA probe. The hybrids are detected with an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled antibody. ALP hydrolyzes the phosphate ester of fluorosalicylic acid, and the fluorosalicylate produced forms highly fluorescent ternary complexes with Tb(3+)-EDTA, which can be quantified by measuring the Tb3+ fluorescence in a time-resolved mode. As low as 0.4 fmol of target DNA can be detected. Also, a single leukemic cell may be detected in the presence of 0.5 million ""normal"" cells.","['Radovich, P', 'Bortolin, S', 'Christopoulos, T K']","['Radovich P', 'Bortolin S', 'Christopoulos TK']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (RNA Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/blood/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Probes/*analysis/chemical synthesis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Templates, Genetic']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac00111a023 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 1995 Aug 1;67(15):2644-9. doi: 10.1021/ac00111a023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These shadows had been observed on a chest X-ray film in 1988, and had been gradually growing for more than five years. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) of the left upper lobe mass resulted in a histological diagnosis of pulmonary pseudolymphoma. The shadows showed no change during the next nine months after his discharge. These findings are suggestive of the natural history of pulmonary pseudolymphoma.

We conclude that CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcript detection, as a surrogate for the favorable prognosis and treatment planning implied by inv(16) in AML M4Eo, should not be exclusively relied upon in AML M1 in the absence of prospective study of this specific (M1) category of AML. RT-PCR analysis should be correlated with cytogenetics when available and if used alone should be interpreted cautiously in cases of AML with atypical morphological features.","['Monahan, B P', 'Rector, J T', 'Liu, P P', 'Cotelingam, J D', 'Dahut, W']","['Monahan BP', 'Rector JT', 'Liu PP', 'Cotelingam JD', 'Dahut W']","['Division of Hematology, The National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD 20889-5000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Eosinophilia/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1653-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The progeny of this transformed ancestor undergo recognizable albeit dysplastic maturation. We propose that this picture is further complicated by a variety of cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) which exert a dual effect on the diseased cells. The immature CD34+ cells are stimulated to proliferate, while their later differentiated daughters are induced to undergo apoptosis accounting for the clinical syndrome of pancytopenia despite hypercellular BMs. Studies directed at measuring the rates of proliferation and apoptosis as well as the levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and IL-1beta confirm this hypothesis and are presented in greater detail. A novel approach towards MDS therapy emerges as a result of this paradigm shift based upon the premise that anti-cytokine therapy would prevent excessive intramedullary apoptosis and result in improved cytopenias as well as cause a slowing down of the diseased precursor cell proliferation resulting in resumption of polyclonal hematopoiesis. Because a number of cytokines function through common lipid second messengers, interruption of this pathway should theoretically cause disruption in the signalling of a cascade of cytokines.","['Raza, A', 'Mundle, S', 'Shetty, V', 'Alvi, S', 'Chopra, H', 'Span, L', 'Parcharidou, A', 'Dar, S', 'Venugopal, P', 'Borok, R', 'Gezer, S', 'Showel, J', 'Loew, J', 'Robin, E', 'Rifkin, S', 'Alston, D', 'Hernandez, B', 'Shah, R', 'Kaizer, H', 'Gregory, S', 'Preisler, H']","['Raza A', 'Mundle S', 'Shetty V', 'Alvi S', 'Chopra H', 'Span L', 'Parcharidou A', 'Dar S', 'Venugopal P', 'Borok R', 'Gezer S', 'Showel J', 'Loew J', 'Robin E', 'Rifkin S', 'Alston D', 'Hernandez B', 'Shah R', 'Kaizer H', 'Gregory S', 'Preisler H']","[""Rush Cancer Institute, Rush-Presbyterian-St Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*pathology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1648-52.,,59,"['CA60085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen weeks after irradiation, mice which had received bone marrow or dendritic cells had an equally low incidence of lymphoma, whereas mice which had received thymocytes or which had been only irradiated developed equally high levels of lymphomas, indicating that thymic dendritic cells played a key role in the prevention of lymphoma development. When thymuses from 15-week survivors were tested for pre-lymphoma cells, those from dendritic cell-treated mice proved to be endowed with a level of lymphomagenic potential intermediate between that from bone marrow-treated mice (nonlymphomagenic) and that from untreated or thymocyte-treated mice (highly lymphomagenic).

Compared to vector alone-infected cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with mutant p53 showed increased proliferative potential, enhanced cloning efficiencies and a modified differentiation pattern in vitro. In addition, mutant p53-transduced hematopoietic cells were more resistant to loss of viability and/or induction of apoptosis when cultured in a low concentration of serum or in the absence of both growth factors and serum. These effects occurred rapidly with no apparent contributory secondary events. No permanent cell lines or growth factor-independent cell strains were obtained.

Fibroblast monocultures served as controls. After 6 days, glucose, as well as galactose-treated cultures showed a significant reduction of fibroblast growth in cocultures and fibroblast monocultures. In contrast, application of mannose caused no reducing effect on fibroblast numbers. Administration of fucose, AAA, LTA or UEA-I revealed a strong impairment of fibroblast growth in the megakaryocyte-fibroblast cocultures. Adhesion experiments using MACS-enriched, fluorescein-labelled megakaryocytes cultured in the presence of carbohydrates and lectins on a near-confluent layer of fibroblasts were additionally performed. Following fucose-BSA, alpha Fuc-1,2Gal beta-HSA or UEA-I treatment a significant reduction of megakaryocyte adhesion to the fibroblast layer could be observed. In the case of AAA a weak impairment of megakaryocyte adhesion could be noticed. Selective pretreatment of either fibroblasts or megakaryocytes with fucose-BSA or alpha Fuc-1,2Gal beta-HSA was consistent with the finding of a prominent involvement of fucosylated residues located on megakaryocytes in this interaction. In conclusion, our studies are in keeping with the assumption that fucosylated and fucose-binding structures are playing a key role in adhesion mechanisms between megakaryocytes and fibroblasts and thus influence significantly the megakaryocyte-dependent growth of bone marrow fibroblasts.","['Schmitz, B', 'Thiele, J', 'Otto, F', 'Theile-Ochel, S', 'Heedt, T', 'Zensen, U', 'Baldus, S E', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Fischer, R']","['Schmitz B', 'Thiele J', 'Otto F', 'Theile-Ochel S', 'Heedt T', 'Zensen U', 'Baldus SE', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligosaccharides/*pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1604-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have established a novel pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (JKB2) with a chromosomal translocation between 9p2l and 14q32, on which p16INK4A/p15INK4B and heavy chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, respectively, are located. Homozygous deletions of P16INK4A/p15INK4B genes in JKB2 cells were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, and their protein products were not detectable by Western blotting. Therefore JKB2 is the first example of an immunoglobulin heavy chain translocation associated with deletions of these genes. In JKB2 cells, cyclin-dependent kinase(CDK)4 and CDK6 formed complexes with cyclin D, due to the lack of p16, triggering phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and continuous cell proliferation. Moreover, the growth of JKB2 cells was partially inhibited by TGF beta or IL-7, accompanied by decreased CDK4 and CDK6 expression, increased p2l and p27 expression, decreased p27 binding to CDK4/CDK6, and increased binding of p27 to CDK2. In addition, IL-7 both inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of JKB2 cells. These studies suggest that a t(9;14)(p21;q32) chromosomal translocation can result in deletion of both p16 INK4A and p15 INK4B genes in pre-B ALL, and that the JKB2 cell line therefore provides a model for the study of leukemogenesis related to abnormalities in chromosome 9p2l. Moreover, they suggest that TGF-beta can, suppress JKB2 cell growth in a p15-independent mechanism.","['Urashima, M', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Kaihara, C', 'Matsuzaki, M', 'Chauhan, D', 'Ogata, A', 'Teoh, G', 'DeCaprio, J A', 'Anderson, K C']","['Urashima M', 'Hoshi Y', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Kaihara C', 'Matsuzaki M', 'Chauhan D', 'Ogata A', 'Teoh G', 'DeCaprio JA', 'Anderson KC']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1576-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce this toxicity, with the aim of increasing its therapeutic index, AmB can be encapsulated into liposomes or bound to lipid carriers. Following promising clinical results with investigational formulations, three industrial compounds are available at this moment: Abelcet (Amphotericin B Lipid Complex, ABLC), Amphocil (Amphotericin B Colloidal Dispersion) and AmBisome. These three formulations differ significantly in composition and pharmacokinetics. All three compounds share a considerable reduction of nephrotoxicity, but the number of acute reactions differ among these compounds, Amphocil showing the highest and AmBisome the lowest rate. Increased therapeutic indexes for all three formulations were shown only in some of the animal models for several fungal infections. Four recent clinical trials comparing these formulations with AmB demonstrated their clinical efficacy but failed to clearly show an increased therapeutic index. Therefore these compounds can be recommended in cases of intolerance to or failure on AmB therapy. The optimal therapeutic dosages have not been established, but dosages as low as 1 mg/kg should probably be avoided in the initial treatment of fulminant fungal infections, since efficacy may be inferior to equal dosages of conventional AmB.","['Leenders, A C', 'de Marie, S']","['Leenders AC', 'de Marie S']","['University Hospital Rotterdam/Dijkzigt, Dept Bacteriology, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1570-5.,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Santana et al (J Clin Oncol 1992; 10: 364-370) reported a CR rate of 8/17 (95% Cl 23-72%) in children with relapsed AML and a median first CR of 21 months. The activity of 2CdA in adults with relapsed or refractory leukemia was therefore investigated in a phase I study. In the phase II study, based on biochemical modulation rationale, 2CdA was combined with Ara-C for adults with relapsed AML to test the effectiveness of this combination therapy. In the phase I study 27 patients (25 AML and two MDS) with a median first CR duration of 21 weeks, received 2CdA at doses ranging from 5 to 13 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion (CI) for 7 days. In vitro and ex vivo pharmacologic studies performed to determine the effect of pretreatment with 2CdA on Ara-CTP accumulation in leukemic blasts demonstrated a 50-65% increase in the rate of Ara-CTP accumulation. Based on this biochemical modulation, 2CdA (12 mg/m2/day x 5 days by CI) was combined with Ara-C (1 g/m2/day over 2 h) in a phase II study. Seventeen patients (15 AML, two MDS) with relapsed AML (median 1st CR of 19 weeks) were treated. In the phase I study two patients died before the day 14 marrow (ED). Marrow hypoplasia developed in 16 of the remaining 25. Leukemic regrowth occurred in nine after a median hypoplastic period of 2 weeks (range 1-3 weeks). The other seven patients died with aplastic marrows, median duration of hypoplasia was 2 weeks, range 1-4 weeks. None achieved CR and the median survival was 10.5 weeks. Toxicity generally was mild except for three late occurring cases of grade III or IV renal dysfunction and two cases of tumor lysis syndrome. The MTD was 10.8 mg/m2/day x 7 days. In the phase II study two patients, both with AML, achieved CR (95% CI 1-33%). In both cases leukemia relapsed after 10 weeks and 17 weeks. There was one ED. Most (11/16) cleared their marrow although leukemic infiltrate regrew in six cases. Toxicity was generally mild, with two episodes of grade 2 GI bleeding, one episode of severe renal dysfunction and one case of grade 2 CNS toxicity. We conclude that as a single agent 2CdA at the MTD is a cytoreductive agent but is not sufficient to achieve CR in adults with relapsed AML. While combination of Ara-C with 2CdA increases the Ara-CTP uptake in these heavily treated patients this regimen does not appear to be an improvement over existing modalities.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Gandhi, V', 'Andreeff, H M', 'Beran, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Koller, C A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Plunkett, W', 'Estey, E']","['Kornblau SM', 'Gandhi V', 'Andreeff HM', 'Beran M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Koller CA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Plunkett W', 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Oct;10(10):1563-9.,,,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are some indications that maternal alcohol consumption is associated with an elevated risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) appearing in very young children. Evidence for an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of leukemia in offspring has been inconsistent. PURPOSE: Using data from a Children's Cancer Group case-control study, we evaluated relationships between infant leukemia risk and parental alcohol consumption and/or cigarette smoking during pregnancy or during the month prior to it. METHODS: Three hundred two leukemia cases (203 acute lymphoid leukemias [ALLs], 88 AMLs, and 11 other leukemia types) diagnosed in children at 18 months of age or younger and 558 individually matched, regional (i.e., same telephone area code and exchange number) controls were included in the analysis. Information concerning parental alcohol consumption and smoking behavior during the index pregnancy and during the month prior to it was collected by telephone interviews with the mothers of all case and control subjects and the fathers of 250 case and 361 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to measure the risk of infant leukemia associated with parental smoking and drinking; tests for trend were used to assess dose-response relationships. The data were analyzed further after stratifying the leukemia cases according to histologic and morphologic types. Reported P values are from two-sided tests of statistical significance. RESULTS: Maternal drinking during pregnancy (compared with not drinking) was associated with ORs of 1.43 (95%) confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-2.04) for ALL and 2.64 (95% CI = 1.36-5.06) for AML. A dose-response relationship was observed for total maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and risk of AML (P < .01). Alcohol-related risk appeared to be most pronounced for children who developed AML with a morphology of M1 (myeloblastic with minimal maturation) or M2 (myeloblastic with maturation (OR = 7.62; 95% CI = 2.03-28.64). Paternal alcohol consumption did not confer an increased risk of infant leukemia. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (compared with not smoking) was negatively associated with infant leukemia risk (OR = 0.66 and 95% CI = 0.46-0.94 for total leukemia; OR = 0.45 and 95% CI = 0.21-0.96 for AML), whereas paternal smoking 1 month prior to pregnancy (compared with not smoking during the same period) was related to an elevated risk of ALL (OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.03-2.36). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of infant leukemia, especially AML. Maternal smoking, however, does not elevate risk for either AML or ALL. IMPLICATIONS: The data suggest that in utero exposure to alcohol may contribute to leukemogenesis involving myeloid cells.","['Shu, X O', 'Ross, J A', 'Pendergrass, T W', 'Reaman, G H', 'Lampkin, B', 'Robison, L L']","['Shu XO', 'Ross JA', 'Pendergrass TW', 'Reaman GH', 'Lampkin B', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",1996/01/03 00:00,1996/01/03 00:01,['1996/01/03 00:00'],"['1996/01/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.1.24 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Jan 3;88(1):24-31. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.1.24.,,,"['CA09607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch clamp and fura-2 AM measurements were performed to study the effects of sensitizing the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor to InsP3 on the activation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells. 2. The sensitizing agent thimerosal (1 microM) triggered Ca2+ release, and this was followed by Ca2+ influx. With no added InsP3 in the patch pipette, thimerosal activated ICRAC; this was prevented by heparin. ICRAC activated by thimerosal was very similar to that evoked by InsP3 or ionomycin. 3. Dialysing cells either for short (30 s) or long (600 s) periods of time prior to application of thimerosal did not affect the subsequent activation of ICRAC, even though no InsP3 was included in the patch pipette. 4. These results suggest that sensitizing the InsP3 receptor can result in large Ca2+ influx in the presence of resting InsP3, and that stores closer to the membrane may contribute more to activation of ICRAC than stores further away.","['Parekh, A B', 'Penner, R']","['Parekh AB', 'Penner R']","['Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['2225PI3MOV (Thimerosal)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Thimerosal/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp021058 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol. 1995 Dec 1;489 ( Pt 2):377-82. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp021058.,PMC1156765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is presumed, therefore, that these nonclassical molecules must have a distinct antigen-presenting function in which polymorphism is not advantageous. In some cases this may involve presentation of a nonpeptide antigen, as has been demonstrated for human CD1b. It is possible that a molecule adapted to present bacterial lipids would remain relatively nonpolymorphic, because a lipid, which is the end product of a complex biosynthetic pathway, is likely to evolve less rapidly than a short stretch of amino acid sequence containing a T-cell epitope. Alternatively, the lack of polymorphism could reflect the presentation by these molecules of relatively invariant peptides, such as those derived from heat shock proteins. It also is possible that a nonpolymorphic molecule could be selected for the presentation of modified peptides. An example of this is the M3 molecule, which can bind even short peptides as long as they have a formylated N-terminus (Fischer Lindahl et al. 1991). Based upon their structural differences, we believe it is likely that the TL antigen and mCD1 are likely to present different types of ligands. The presence in the TL antigen of the conserved amino acids, which in class I normally from hydrogen bonds with peptides, suggests that the TL antigen also can present nanomeric peptides. A peptide antigen-presenting function also is suggested by the expression of the TL antigen by at least one antigen-presenting cell type, the epithelial cell of the intestine, and by the ability of alloreactive T cells to recognize the TL molecule. While we favor the hypothesis that the TL antigen presents peptides, the data cited above do not constitute formal proof of any kind of antigen-presenting function, and it remains possible that the TL antigen does something else. As noted above, no attempts to elucidate the structure of the ligands bound to the TL antigen have so far succeeded, including the screening of bacteriophage display libraries (Castano, A.R., Miller, J.E., Holcombe, H.R., unpublished data). In contrast, our recent work has demonstrated that mCD1 presents relatively long peptides with a structured motif distinct from classical class I molecules. This mCD1-binding motif, which is present in a wide range of proteins, does not by itself provide a simple explanation for the lack of mCD1 polymorphism and, as noted above, it remains possible that the natural ligand for mCD1 is a nonpeptide structure. Besides their lack of polymorphism, the TL antigen and mCD1 molecules share two additional features in common which might give insight into their their biological role. First, their surface expression does not depend upon the presence of a functional TAP transporter, and they probably can reach the cell surface as empty molecules. Second, both molecules are expressed by epithelial cells in the intestine. This leads to the speculation that these two nonclassical class I molecules could be involved in sampling or uptake of lumenal peptides for their ultimate presentation to cells of the systematic immune system. For example, longer lumenal peptides could be taken up by mCD1, and perhaps by the TL antigen, and then further processed to nonamers for presentation by classical class I molecules. They also could be transported across the epithelial cell by the TL antigen or mCD1 and subsequently presented by either class I or class II molecules expressed by cells in the lamina propria. This sampling or uptake mediated by either the TL antigen or mCD1 could play a role in the induction of immune responses, or more likely perhaps, in the induction of systemic oral tolerance to peptide antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","['Cheroutre, H', 'Holcombe, H R', 'Tangri, S', 'Castano, A R', 'Teitell, M', 'Miller, J E', 'Cardell, S', 'Benoist, C', 'Mathis, D', 'Huse, W D']","['Cheroutre H', 'Holcombe HR', 'Tangri S', 'Castano AR', 'Teitell M', 'Miller JE', 'Cardell S', 'Benoist C', 'Mathis D', 'Huse WD', 'et al.']","['UCLA Department of Microbiology & Immunology 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD1/*physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1995.tb00086.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1995 Oct;147:31-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1995.tb00086.x.,,73,"['K11 AI01213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG10152/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Specific identification of MAC was made by culture in BACTEC system from an open lung biopsy. RESULTS: A 5-year-old girl diagnosed with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia was admitted because of fever during the maintenance phase after achieving a complete remission of her malignancy. A mild dry cough started on day 4 of admission, and a chest roentgenogram revealed a pulmonary infiltrate. An insidious respiratory distress developed and mechanical ventilation was undertaken. An open-lung biopsy, carried out on day 10 of ventilatory support, revealed acid-fast bacilli subsequently grown as MAC. In spite of combined antimycobacterial treatment, the patient followed a downhill course and died on day 41 of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This report describes a new case of fatal MAC infection in an immunocompromised, non-HIV infected child. MAC must be added to the list of infectious microorganisms that can infect children with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.

Recently, a subset of patients with hyperdiploid ALL and trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10 has been reported to have a very favorable event-free survival. Rapid and accurate detection of these patients will allow them to be treated with highly effective and relatively nontoxic antimetabolite therapy. Because of inherent problems associated with conventional cancer cytogenetics, we examined the efficacy of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify this ALL subgroup. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty uncultured bone marrow specimens from children with newly diagnosed ALL were examined for chromosomes 4 and 10 aneuploidy with FISH. These results were compared with routine cytogenetics and DNA Index (DI). RESULTS: Interphase FISH cytogenetics identified the abnormal cell line(s) in all cases in which cytogenetics showed aneuploidy of chromosomes 4 and 10. In cases in which cytogenetics was not informative, FISH identified the presence of an aneuploid chromosome 4 and/or 10 cell line in concordance with the DI. CONCLUSIONS: FISH interphase cytogenetics can accurately detect chromosome 4 and 10 aneuploidy in leukemic cells. It is a rapid and clinically applicable technique that can reliably identify childhood ALL cases who have trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10 and who have very favorable event-free survival.","['Martin, P L', 'Look, A T', 'Schnell, S', 'Harris, M B', 'Pullen, J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Carroll, A J', 'Pettenati, M J', 'Rao, P N']","['Martin PL', 'Look AT', 'Schnell S', 'Harris MB', 'Pullen J', 'Shuster JJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Rao PN']","['Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199605000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 May;18(2):113-21. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199605000-00004.,,,"['CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinic and hospital records for 472 children at 12 sites who were receiving maintenance chemotherapy on Protocol 105 of the Childrens Cancer Group. RESULTS: During a mean maintenance period of 2 1/2 years there were 120 exposures to varicella among susceptible children (10/100 patient-years). During the same period there were 60 cases of varicella (4.6/100 patient-years). Half of the cases of varicella occurred without a known exposure. Exposures and varicella resulted in significant omission or delay in chemotherapy. Total medical charges for varicella-related events were $492,000 ($470 per varicella exposure; $7,450 per case of varicella). A proposed preventative strategy using varicella vaccine after 6 months of maintenance therapy would theoretically reduce varicella-related charges by 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella exposure and varicella are common in this patient population. The use of varicella vaccine during the early maintenance period should be considered to prevent these events. This strategy is likely to be safe, and will save significant medical charges, drug omission, disease-related morbidity, hospitalization, and work and school disruption.","['Buda, K', 'Tubergen, D G', 'Levin, M J']","['Buda K', 'Tubergen DG', 'Levin MJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chickenpox/*complications/*economics/prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/economics/*virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/economics/therapeutic use', 'Viral Vaccines/economics/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199605000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 May;18(2):106-12. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199605000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines detection of minimal residual disease by immunohistological staining using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) B-ly 7 in 11 patients with complete remission of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) after 2-CdA therapy administered between 1990 and 1993. In all 11 cases, residual hairy cells could be detected by MoAb B-ly 7 (0.1 to 7.5%, median 0.65%). At a follow-up period of 7 - 29 months (median 19.3), 9 of these patients remained in complete remission, whereas 2 patients relapsed 22 and 27 months after 2-CdA therapy. To determine whether flow-cytometric analysis of hairy-cells in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood cells are comparable with results obtained by immunostaining with B-ly 7 in bone marrow biopsies, available data using CD-19/CD-11c double-staining were analyzed. In 5 of 10 cases no hairy-cells could be detected in bone marrow aspirates, and in 6 partly different cases no hairy-cells were detectable in peripheral blood using flow-cytometry, although immunostaining of bone marrow biopsies using B-ly 7 revealed hairy-cells (ranging form 0.1 to 7.5%) in these cases. These results indicate that therapy with 2-CdA does not eradicate hairy cell leukemia despite complete remission according to conventional criteria. Minimal residual disease might be responsible for subsequent relapse. We conclude that routine immunohistological examination of bone marrow biopsies with B-ly 7 should be performed for assessment of MRD. Flow cytometric investigations of mononuclear cells of bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood seem valuable for regular long term monitoring of MRD, but does not substitute for immunostaining of bone marrow biopsies.","['Konwalinka, G', 'Schirmer, M', 'Hilbe, W', 'Fend, F', 'Geisen, F', 'Knoblechner, A', 'Petzer, A', 'Thaler, J']","['Konwalinka G', 'Schirmer M', 'Hilbe W', 'Fend F', 'Geisen F', 'Knoblechner A', 'Petzer A', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(85)70016-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1995.0016 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1995;21(2):142-51. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1995.0016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant cells cultured without paclitaxel or vincristine (controls) showed well-developed microtubules radiating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Malignant cells cultured with paclitaxel showed bundling of microtubules and those cultured with vincristine showed crystal formation of the microtubules. In 28 lymphoid malignancies, the difference in the percentage of cells showing microtubular changes with paclitaxel and vincristine was significant (paired t test) after 2h p < 0.01, after 4h P < 0.05, and after 20 h P < 0.05. As paclitaxel is not in clinical use for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in Japan, no clinical material was available. In 6 out of 9 patients with lymphoid malignancies with a previous history of combined chemotherapy including vincristine, paclitaxel produced microtubular changes in a higher percentage of cells than did vincristine. In 10 myeloid malignancies, the percentages of the cells with microtubular changes induced by paclitaxel was also higher than those induced by vincristine (P < 0.05 in 2 h, p < 0.01 in 4h, and p < 0.05 in 20h). Although the number of studied cases was small, this suggests that paclitaxel is as effective as vincristine in certain hematologic malignancies. As microtubular changes induced by paclitaxel and vincristine are easy to assess, the study of microtubular changes induced in vitro by antimicrotubular agents may prove useful in predicting the chemotherapeutic effect in vivo of these agents.","['Hirose, Y', 'Takiguchi, T']","['Hirose Y', 'Takiguchi T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*therapeutic use', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(85)70014-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1995.0014 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1995;21(2):119-30. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1995.0014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 5% of the small neurons expressed bFGF mRNA in normal DRGs. Nerve injury induced a very dramatic and rapid up-regulation in bFGF mRNA levels, and around 80% of all DRG neurons expressed bFGF mRNA 3 days after axotomy. A distinct increase in bFGF-like immunoreactivity (LI) was also detected as early as 15 h after axotomy. The elevation of bFGF mRNA and protein levels declined after 1 week. bFGF mRNA was also up-regulated in non-neuronal cells following axotomy. Normally bFGF-LI was mainly localized in the nuclei of DRG neurons and in some non-neuronal cells. After nerve section, bFGF-LI was in addition found in the cytoplasm, and many more bFGF-positive non-neuronal cells were observed. By means of confocal microscopy analysis of axotomized DRGs, some bFGF-LI could be detected in vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleoli, in addition to the nuclear location. Application of leukaemia inhibitory factor to the transected sciatic nerve significantly increased the number of bFGF-positive neurons, whereas the bFGF-LI in non-neuronal cells was strongly suppressed. About 70% of the normal DRG neurons expressed aFGF mRNA and aFGF-LI. Axotomy produced a moderate increase in aFGF mRNA levels, but no detectable effect on protein levels.

At concentrations of 0.1-0.3 ng/ml, the peptide stimulates a maximal increase in cell number. LIF initiates a prolonged proliferative response lasting up to 13 days, when myoblasts are exposed to it in culture. LIF expression can be detected in vivo during development of limb muscle and in adult regenerating skeletal muscle tissue. Here, we studied the levels of expression of alpha-bungarotoxin-binding sites as a measure of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), myosin light chain pattern and rate of myotube formation in fused, control and LIF-treated muscle cultures derived from mouse hind-limb muscles. We found that both the level of expression of AChRs and myosin light chain pattern, are normal, following exposure of the cells to LIF. There was no difference in the rate of myotube formation between LIF-stimulated and control myoblasts over a 10-fold concentration range (0.3-3.0 ng/ml) as determined by nuclei counts. Taken together, these results suggest that LIF, in combination with other cytokines, may act in vivo to stimulate rapid growth, without significant differentiation, during the early phases of myogenesis.","['Vakakis, N', 'Bower, J', 'Austin, L']","['Vakakis N', 'Bower J', 'Austin L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neurochem Int,Neurochemistry international,8006959,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Muscle Development', 'Muscles/cytology/*drug effects', 'Myosin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0197-0186(95)00014-y [doi]'],ppublish,Neurochem Int. 1995 Oct-Nov;27(4-5):329-35. doi: 10.1016/0197-0186(95)00014-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitive electrophoretic methods have shown that the incidence of these diseases is as high as 5% in adult individuals. Thus, the majority of cases should be considered to be a normal phenomenon. A few transform into neoplastic diseases, plasma cells becoming responsible for lytic bone lesions, the hallmark of MM. The distinction of benign and malignant forms is frequently difficult at presentation. We can easily recognize solitary myeloma, overt myeloma and plasma cell leukaemia, which require immediate chemotherapy. Therapy could be safely withheld in all the remaining forms, which require only follow-up. Thus, we suggest that plasma cell dyscrasias should be classified simply into two main groups according to the need of immediate chemotherapy. The appearance of new bone lesions and the increase of the M-component level remain the only two criteria that define malignant transformation. Several clinical and laboratory prognostic parameters indicate the risk of transformation, and hence how close the follow-up of the patient should be. Parameters related to the expansion of the plasma cell clone (percentage of bone marrow plasma cells, M-component level, lytic bone lesions and beta 2-microglobulin) are not always very low and very high in the benign and malignant forms, respectively, and frequently overlap in patients with intermediate plasma cell expansions. On the contrary, all parameters related to the intrinsic malignancy of the plasma cells (plasma cell LI, Karyotypic abnormalities and molecular alterations) have, by definition, to be normal in the benign forms. MRI is a new tool that may, early on, reveal lytic bone lesions undetectable by conventional radiography.","['Boccadoro, M', 'Pileri, A']","['Boccadoro M', 'Pileri A']","['Department of Medicine and Experimental Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,"['Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/classification/diagnosis', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/diagnosis', 'Paraproteinemias/*classification/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/classification/diagnosis', 'Risk Factors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80255-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1995 Dec;8(4):705-19. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80255-0.,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether effective reversal of drug resistance could be achieved by using many reversers together, each at a low dose relative to its maximal tolerated plasma level. We measured in cell culture, using resistant P388 cells in suspension, the extent of reversal of the accumulation of two labeled cytotoxins (vinblastine and daunomycin). We fitted the data to a modified Michaelis-Menten equation and extracted the half-inhibition constants for 18 reversers acting on the pump. We measured also the reversal of resistance in a cell growth assay using incorporation of labeled thymidine. We showed that these drugs in groups of up to 18 together, each drug being at a low dose, in many cases well-tolerated in humans, had additive effects so that the combination was as effective as any of the drugs present singly. This was the case both for reversal of cell accumulation and for the effects of cytotoxins on cell growth. Our data show that a low-dose multidrug approach to saturation reversal of the multidrug pump is feasible in cell culture and provide the initial experimental basis for the development of an effective regime of such combination reversal therapy.","['Lyubimov, E', 'Lan, L B', 'Pashinsky, I', 'Ayesh, S', 'Stein, W D']","['Lyubimov E', 'Lan LB', 'Pashinsky I', 'Ayesh S', 'Stein WD']","['Biochemistry Department, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/therapeutic use']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199512000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1995 Dec;6(6):727-35. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199512000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the structure and function of the MZF-1 gene by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, genomic cloning, and promoter analysis. Comparison of human promyelocytic HL-60 cell cDNA with isolated MZF-1 genomic clones indicated that the human MZF-1 gene is without introns and spans approximately 3 kb. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern analysis indicated further that the human MZF-1 gene is a single-copy gene. Primer extension studies identified the major transcription start site as a thymidine residue located 1102 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon. A putative TATA box sequence (TAAAAA) was found at -66 bp and a CCAAT box at -130 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. In HL-60 cells, MZF-1 mRNA levels are increased by granulopoietic inducers including retinoic acid and GM-CSF. DNA upstream of the transcription start site contains tandem-repeated consensus retinoic acid response elements at -666 through -696 bp and paired putative GM-CSF-responsive sequences centered at -50 and -100 bp. CAT reporter gene constructs containing these DNA regions promoted transcription and conferred transcriptional responsiveness to retinoic acid and GM-CSF when transfected into HL-60 cells. Additional putative regulatory binding sites included conserved MZF-1 zinc finger binding sequences, the importance of which was suggested by the enhanced expression of the endogenous MZF-1 gene following vector-driven expression of MZF-1 constructs in K562 myeloblastic leukemia cells.

Tandem binding sites for the erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E2 are important for the transcriptional activation function of the LCR. We discovered that vanadate strongly stimulates the DNA binding activity of NF-E2 in crude and fractionated nuclear extracts. The other oxyanions, molybdate and tungstate, do not affect NF-E2 DNA binding. Quantitative DNA binding experiments indicated that vanadate stimulates NF-E2 DNA binding by increasing the number of NF-E2 molecules that are competent to bind to DNA, rather than influencing the affinity of binding. Gel filtration analysis revealed a similar Stokes' radius for NF-E2, in the absence or presence of vanadate, inconsistent with a role for vanadate in stabilizing the heteromeric NF-E2 complex. Distinct NF-E2 forms, which were either weakly or strongly induced by vanadate, were resolved by cation and anion exchange chromatography. A model is proposed in which two conformers of NF-E2 share an identical subunit composition, but differ in DNA binding activity. Vanadate may interact directly with one of the conformers to generate the high-affinity DNA binding state. The presence of a non-DNA binding pool of NF-E2 suggests that the formation of an active NF-E2 heteromer may be a regulated step in the cell.","['Lam, L T', 'Bresnick, E H']","['Lam LT', 'Bresnick EH']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1995/12/19 00:00,1995/12/19 00:01,['1995/12/19 00:00'],"['1995/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00050a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Dec 19;34(50):16347-58. doi: 10.1021/bi00050a015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha induced signals are mediated by two types of TNF receptors (TNFR), p55- and p75-TNFR, and p55-TNFR is homologous to the Fas antigen. Interestingly, UK110 cells showed resistance to apoptosis by agonistic anti-p55-TNFR antibody, indicating that UK110 cells were resistant to Fas- and p55-TNFR-mediated apoptosis. Because expression of apoptosis-associated molecules, such as c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bax, was similar between U937 and UK110 cells an undetermined pathway for apoptosis through Fas and p55-TNFR could be mutated in UK110 cells.

By inoculating test supernatants under centrifugation (which we term spinoculation), we increased the sensitivity of detection of RCR 10 to 100-fold with the PG-4 S+ L- and lacZ marker rescue assays. While the spinoculation protocol had no adverse effects on cells, spinoculation of high titer vector supernatants onto PG-4 cells resulted in some cytotoxicity, making identification of RCR positive cultures difficult. However, spinoculation of vector supernatants onto M. dunni lacZ cells resulted in no cytotoxicity, and also partially overcame inhibition of detection of low levels of RCR due to the presence of high titer replication-incompetent vector.","['Forestell, S P', 'Dando, J S', 'Bohnlein, E', 'Rigg, R J']","['Forestell SP', 'Dando JS', 'Bohnlein E', 'Rigg RJ']","['Progenesys Progrunt, SyStemix Inc., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virology/*methods', '*Virus Replication']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166093496020526 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-0934(96)02052-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1996 Jul;60(2):171-8. doi: 10.1016/0166-0934(96)02052-6.,,,"['TGT06S01/Telethon/Italy', 'TGT95000/Telethon/Italy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Culture medium conditioned by this human endometrial cell line was screened for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Comparisons were made to the African Green monkey kidney epithelial cell line (Vero), which has been well documented to be embryotrophic. SETTING: This study was conducted in a university-based research laboratory associated with a clinical IVF program. RESULTS: The monkey Vero cell line and our permanent human endometrial cell line produced several common growth factors and cytokines, such as IL-6, PDGF, and LIF. IL-6 was secreted in substantial amounts by both Vero cells (400 pg/ml per 100,000 cells) and endometrial cells (100 pg/ml). PDGF levels in culture supernatant were measured to be 72 and 35 pg/ml, respectively, for Vero and endometrial cells. LIF could not be assayed in our human cell line by ELISA but its presence was evidenced by immunocytochemistry. EGF and active TGF-beta were not detectable in conditioned medium from either cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The two embryotrophic cell lines analyzed in this investigation synthesized several common growth factors and cytokines.

More particularly, we have constructed a vector that, by histochemical assays for the protein, expresses the beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) gene for at least 18 months post infection. We have further characterized the expression of beta-Gal transcripts by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and determined that there are 32,000 copies of beta-Gal transcripts per 0.5 microgram of total RNA at 18 months post infection. The vector makes use of the mouse Moloney leukemia virus (MMLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter located directly upstream from the latency-associated transcripts (LAT) promoter region and expresses mRNA from the DNA strand opposite to that expressing the LAT. Finally, the vector was constructed using a system that allows other promoter/gene constructs to be easily inserted into the viral genome. It may have utility in studying the effects of cellular or viral gene expression on establishment, maintenance or reactivation from latency or for the delivery and expression of therapeutic proteins employed in gene therapy of the nervous system.","['Carpenter, D E', 'Stevens, J G']","['Carpenter DE', 'Stevens JG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1747, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neurons/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Latency/*physiology', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.12-1447 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Aug 1;7(12):1447-54. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.12-1447.,,,['NS-30420/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current gene therapy protocols involving gene transfer into lymphocytes utilize retroviruses with amphotropic envelope proteins. However, transduction efficiencies in lymphocytes using these viruses are relatively low. A potential strategy to improve gene transfer efficiency is the utilization of alternative retroviral envelopes that target unique receptors on the cell surface. One such alternative retroviral envelope, the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope, targets a distinct surface receptor (GLVR-1) that is 60% homologous but not cross-reactive to the amphotropic receptor (GLVR-2/RAM-1). Understanding the relationship between receptor expression and transduction efficiency is important for designing new strategies to improve gene transfer. Therefore, we compared GLVR-1 and GLVR-2 mRNA levels in lymphocytes and found that GLVR-1 was expressed 8- to 19-fold higher than GLVR-2. We then analyzed whether this enhanced expression of GLVR-1 correlated with increased infectivity of lymphocytes by retroviral vectors that utilize the GALV envelope compared to those that use the amphotropic envelope. We evaluated retroviral vectors packaged with either PA317 or PG13, which express the amphotropic and GALV envelopes, respectively. Lymphocyte transduction with PG13-packaged vectors was 4- to 18-fold higher than that with PA317-packaged vectors. These findings suggest that receptor expression level is an important factor in retroviral-target interactions and that gene transfer into human T lymphocytes should be performed with retroviruses that use the GALV envelope as opposed to retroviruses that use the amphotropic envelope.","['Lam, J S', 'Reeves, M E', 'Cowherd, R', 'Rosenberg, S A', 'Hwu, P']","['Lam JS', 'Reeves ME', 'Cowherd R', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Hwu P']","['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC20A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/metabolism/*virology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.12-1415 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Aug 1;7(12):1415-22. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.12-1415.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the identification of megakaryopoiesis and its endoreduplicative activity the monoclonal antibodies CD61 (anti-platelet glycoprotein IIIa) and PC10 raised against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were used. We compared 60 specimens from 20 patients following IFN alpha-2b administration (in combination with IFN gamma in seven patients) with 57 specimens from 22 patients after monotherapy with BU. A close correlation with clinical follow-up studies revealed that in the IFN-treated group the prevalence of atypical micro-megakaryocytes, usually characterizing CML, was conspicuously reduced in repeatedly taken bone marrow samples. Initially, even an increase in size which was levelled to normal values during maintenance therapy was observed. These features were most prominently expressed in the 13 patients with a complete hematologic and/or partial cytogenetic response. Associated with this phenomenon was a significant enhancement of the PCNA-labelling index which indicated a stimulation of endoreduplicative (endomitotic) activity necessary for achieving normal size and ploidy. In the second group of patients treated by BU these changes were absent. For this reason, our findings are in keeping with the assumption that during IFN treatment, there is at least partial recovery and expansion of a putative normal (Ph1-) megakaryopoiesis. In conclusion, megakaryocyte morphology, i.e. normalization in size, is thought to be a useful indicator to evaluate the response to IFN in CML patients.","['Thiele, J', 'Zirbes, T', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Niederle, N', 'Dammasch, J', 'Schmidt, M', 'Windecker, R', 'Leder, L D', 'Diehl, V', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Zirbes T', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Niederle N', 'Dammasch J', 'Schmidt M', 'Windecker R', 'Leder LD', 'Diehl V', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anal Cell Pathol,Analytical cellular pathology : the journal of the European Society for Analytical Cellular Pathology,8911016,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3', 'Integrins/immunology', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol. 1996 Jun;11(1):31-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLV/HIV chimeric LTR, in which the MLV enhancer replaced the NF-kappa B-binding motifs, was transcriptionally active in human and murine cells in vitro and virus containing the chimeric LTR was replication competent in human cell cultures. Transgenic mice derived from microinjections of chimeric MLV/HIV proviral DNA transcribed HIV genes at a greater frequency and at higher levels than wild-type HIV proviral transgenic mice. MLV/HIV mice were also more apt to develop disease; wasting, periocular infections, and a degenerative myopathy characterized the most predominant phenotype. The tissue specificities of the wild-type and chimeric LTRs in transgenic mice were remarkably similar, but a significant difference was apparent in lymphoid cells. Basal level and LPS-inducible HIV gene expression occurred in peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type HIV transgenic mice. In contrast, HIV gene expression in macrophages from MLV/HIV mice was undetectable, even following LPS induction. However, cultured splenocytes from MLV/HIV mice supported HIV proviral gene transcription better than splenocytes from HIV mice, particularly after induction with LPS or anti-IgD antibody but not with concanavalin A. These data suggest that in transgenic mice, the HIV and MLV/HIV LTRs display a differential tropism for macrophages and B cells, respectively.

In addition, significant inhibition of early and mature leukemic progenitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been obtained with MIP-1 alpha. We performed a study of 25 AML patients at diagnosis to evaluate the effect of a human homolog of MIP-1 alpha (LD78) on bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) leukemic progenitors (colony-forming unit-AML [CFU-AML]) and AML cell proliferation. A methylcellulose culture system was used for CFU-AML and incorporation of 3H-TdR for AML cell proliferation. We found that LD78 inhibits CFU-AML colony formation up to 100% for the BM in 14/16 samples studied with the average maximal inhibition of 62.7 +/- 9.1% and up to 100% for the PB in 12/13 samples studied with the average maximal inhibition of 71.4 +/- 9.9%. In addition to this, LD78 inhibited AML cell proliferation up to 60% for the BM in 10/18 samples studied with the average maximal inhibition of 17.8 +/- 3.5%, and up to 87.1% for the PB cell proliferation in 10/16 samples studied with the average maximal inhibition of 27.5 +/- 6.8%. Our results have shown that LD78 is more active on AML progenitors than on AML cell proliferation. Inhibition of the AML cells, although less than that of the progenitors, indicates that more limited activity of LD78 on more mature leukemic cells is present in AML.","['Basara, N', 'Stosic-Grujicic, S', 'Sefer, D', 'Ivanovic, Z', 'Antunovic, P', 'Milenkovic, P']","['Basara N', 'Stosic-Grujicic S', 'Sefer D', 'Ivanovic Z', 'Antunovic P', 'Milenkovic P']","['Institute of Hematology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic,"" Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140445 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 Jul;14(4):445-51. doi: 10.1002/stem.140445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report documents the mRNA expression profiles of LIF and the two components of the LIF-receptor complex, LIF-R and gp130, during early mouse embryogenesis. These mRNAs were undetectable in 1- or 2-cell embryos, but all were present by the blastocyst stage. LIF transcripts were localised in the differentiated trophectoderm, and were absent from the pluripotential inner cell mass. In contrast, LIF-R mRNA was found in the inner cell mass but not in the trophectoderm. This complementary pattern of expression is suggestive of a paracrine coupling between stem cells and differentiated progeny at the earliest stage of mammalian development. After implantation, transcripts for all components were down-regulated in the embryo. High levels of LIF-R and gp130 mRNAs were observed in the deciduum, however. These dynamic, tissue-specific expression patterns are consistent with regulatory roles for LIF or related cytokines, both in the maintenance of pluripotency in the mouse embryo, and in development of the foeto-maternal interface.","['Nichols, J', 'Davidson, D', 'Taga, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Chambers, I', 'Smith, A']","['Nichols J', 'Davidson D', 'Taga T', 'Yoshida K', 'Chambers I', 'Smith A']","['Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '42013-48-9 (2-phenyl-5,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,4-oxazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['092547739600531X [pii]', '10.1016/0925-4773(96)00531-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 1996 Jul;57(2):123-31. doi: 10.1016/0925-4773(96)00531-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controversy surrounds the treatment of this problem in immunocompromised patients. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the medical records of 83 patients with acute or chronic leukemia in whom anorectal disease developed during inpatient therapy for leukemia was performed to determine the initial signs and symptoms, treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: During a 12-year period, 92 patients with anorectal complications were treated. This series included 25 patients with perirectal abscesses, 22 patients with anal fissures, 18 patients with symptomatic external hemorrhoids, 12 patients with perianal ulcerations, 12 patients with symptomatic internal hemorrhoids, and three patients with fistulas in ano. Overall, 79 (86 percent) of the 92 anorectal complications resolved in 68 of the 83 patients. Increasing periods of neutropenia did not adversely affect the resolution of anorectal disease. Thirteen patients (16 percent) required surgical intervention, most commonly secondary to a perirectal abscess. Incision and drainage was necessary in ten (40 percent) of 25 patients with perirectal abscess, which included five patients with fluctuation and five patients in whom infection failed to respond to medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Noninfectious anorectal complications in patients with leukemia respond to nonoperative intervention and rarely progress to a life-threatening infection. Nonoperative intervention in the form of systemic antibiotics and sitz baths is successful in the treatment of infectious anorectal complications. Incision and drainage should be performed when fluctuation is present and in patients whose complications fail to respond to medical therapy.","['North, J H Jr', 'Weber, T K', 'Rodriguez-Bigas, M A', 'Meropol, N J', 'Petrelli, N J']","['North JH Jr', 'Weber TK', 'Rodriguez-Bigas MA', 'Meropol NJ', 'Petrelli NJ']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Coll Surg,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,9431305,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Abscess/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drainage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fissure in Ano/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rectal Diseases/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Coll Surg. 1996 Oct;183(4):322-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) strongly stimulates the proliferation of myoblasts in vitro and in vivo and its expression in muscle after injury suggests that LIF may have a role as a trauma factor. The mdx mouse was used to study the effects of LIF on in vivo muscle regeneration during disease. The rationale for using trophic factors such as LIF to treat neuromuscular disease includes the understanding that these molecules show some degree of selectivity for the population of cells in which they are effective. LIF was administered to muscle of the mdx mouse using osmotic pumps implanted subcutaneously in unrestrained mice. The growth factor was continuously delivered into the vastus lateralis muscle at 7 U/mu 1 for 7 days via a catheter. The results show that LIF increased the rate of muscle regeneration in mdx mice by stimulating the formation of larger myotubes. LIF treatment also increased the number of regenerating myotubes in the perfused area. This myotrophic action indicates that LIF contributes to muscle regeneration. Together with its known neurotrophic action, LIF is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neuromuscular disease.","['Kurek, J', 'Bower, J', 'Romanella, M', 'Austin, L']","['Kurek J', 'Bower J', 'Romanella M', 'Austin L']","[""Melbourne Neuromuscular Research Centre, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Muscles/*drug effects', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Animal/drug therapy', 'Regeneration/*drug effects']",1996/07/19 00:00,1996/07/19 00:01,['1996/07/19 00:00'],"['1996/07/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3940(96)12802-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3940(96)12802-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 1996 Jul 19;212(3):167-70. doi: 10.1016/0304-3940(96)12802-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The M2 protein of influenza A virus is implicated in transmembrane pH regulation during infection. Whole-cell patch clamp of mouse erythroleukaemia cells expressing the M2 protein in the surface membrane showed a conductance due to M2 which was specifically blocked by the anti-influenza drug rimantadine. 2. The ion selectivity of the rimantadine-sensitive current through M2 was determined. Reversal potentials were close to equilibrium potentials for transmembrane pH gradients and not to those for Na+, K+ or Cl- concentration gradients. M2 permeability to Na+ relative to H+ was estimated to be less than 6 x 10(-7). 3. The M2 conductance increased as external pH decreased below 8.5 and approached saturation at an external pH of 4, effects attributable to increased permeability due to increased driving potential and to activation by low external pH. Both activation and permeation could be described by interaction of protons with sites on M2, with apparent dissociation constants of approximately 0.1 microM and 1 microM, respectively, under physiological conditions. 4. The M2 protein can transfer protons selectively across membranes with the H+ electrochemical gradient, properties consistent with its role in modifying virion and trans-Golgi pH during virus infection.","['Chizhmakov, I V', 'Geraghty, F M', 'Ogden, D C', 'Hayhurst, A', 'Antoniou, M', 'Hay, A J']","['Chizhmakov IV', 'Geraghty FM', 'Ogden DC', 'Hayhurst A', 'Antoniou M', 'Hay AJ']","['National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (M-protein, influenza virus)', '0 (M2 protein, Influenza A virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0T2EF4JQTU (Rimantadine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Influenza A virus/*physiology', 'Ion Channels/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Rimantadine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects/*physiology']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021495 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol. 1996 Jul 15;494 ( Pt 2):329-36. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021495.,PMC1160637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel 5'-adenylic acid deaminase, with relaxed substrate requirements, from Aspergillus species was utilized to deaminate four hexofuranosyladenine nucleosides and five adenine nucleoside dialdehydes to their corresponding inosine analogues. The fastest rates of deamination for the hexofuranosyl nucleosides were for the compounds where the vicinal hydroxyl groups on the sugars are oriented in the erythro configuration. For rapid deamination of the adenine nucleoside dialdehydes, the R configuration at the proximal carbon atom is preferred, while the nature of the group on the distal carbon atom has no significant effect on the rate or extent of deamination.","['Sheid, B', 'Gaetjens, E', 'Chung, S T', 'Lerner, L M']","['Sheid B', 'Gaetjens E', 'Chung ST', 'Lerner LM']","['Department of Pharmacology, SUNY, Health Science Center at Brooklyn 11203, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Experientia,Experientia,0376547,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.6 (AMP Deaminase)']",IM,"['AMP Deaminase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemistry', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemistry', 'Aspergillus/enzymology', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01938874 [doi]'],ppublish,Experientia. 1996 Sep 15;52(9):878-81. doi: 10.1007/BF01938874.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation in glutamine-free or glucose-free medium renewed every 24 h showed that glutamine deprivation is associated with cell death by apoptosis independent of energetic failure, whereas glucose deprivation is followed by rapid loss of mitochondrial function with sharp drop of intracellular ATP and cell death by necrosis. A 12-24 h incubation in glutamine-depleted medium was required to direct the cells toward the apoptotic pathway.

Based on nucleotide variations specific to particular subtypes, it was possible to genotype HTLV-I rapidly by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies following polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, the restriction patterns of two LTR fragments were analyzed using eight restriction endonucleases (AvaI, Eco57I, BsoFI, NdeI, SacI, DraI, MaeII, and MaeIII). Genotyping of HTLV-I was done in nine patients with adult T-cell leukemia or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, in three prostitutes, and in 19 carriers with multiple transfusion in Taiwan. The subtyping results of RFLP studies using these eight restriction endonucleases were in accordance with those of phylogenetic analysis. A substitution of G by A at nucleotide position 503, which creates the DraI site but suppresses the SacI site, was found not only in the Japanese subtype but also in a minority of the cosmopolitan subtype. A mutation near the position of subtype-specific nucleotide variations might suppress the restriction site and lead to unexpected restriction patterns. Amplification of more than one proviral fragment and RFLP studies with a group of appropriate restriction endonucleases may provide rapid and accurate genotyping of HTLV-I. More carriers are required to evaluate the possibility of mixed infection with different HTLV-I subtypes.","['Lin, M T', 'Yang, Y C', 'Chen, P J', 'Tang, J I', 'Tseng, L H', 'Wang, C W', 'Chen, Y C']","['Lin MT', 'Yang YC', 'Chen PJ', 'Tang JI', 'Tseng LH', 'Wang CW', 'Chen YC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, No. 7, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Blood Transfusion', '*Carrier State', 'Genotype', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proviruses/classification/genetics']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050213 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Sep;73(3):127-34. doi: 10.1007/s002770050213.,,,,"['GENBANK/U53021', 'GENBANK/U53022', 'GENBANK/U53023', 'GENBANK/U53024', 'GENBANK/U53025', 'GENBANK/U53026', 'GENBANK/U53027', 'GENBANK/U53028', 'GENBANK/U53029', 'GENBANK/U53030', 'GENBANK/U53031', 'GENBANK/U53032', 'GENBANK/U53033', 'GENBANK/U53034', 'GENBANK/U53035', 'GENBANK/U53036', 'GENBANK/U53037', 'GENBANK/U53038', 'GENBANK/U53039', 'GENBANK/U53040', 'GENBANK/U53041', 'GENBANK/U53042', 'GENBANK/U53043', 'GENBANK/U53044', 'GENBANK/U53045', 'GENBANK/U53046', 'GENBANK/U53047', 'GENBANK/U53048', 'GENBANK/U53049', 'GENBANK/U53050', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawbacks to this approach are the small number of metaphases available during IFN therapy and the impossibility of scoring interphase cells. We applied, besides cytogenetics, double-color FISH (dc-FISH) detection of BCR-ABL gene fusion to monitor 20 CML patients on IFN. dc-FISH easily detected 200 cells per specimen, while with cytogenetic examination a mean of 16.1 mitoses per sample were scored. Though the correlation of dc-FISH and cytogenetic data was good (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), the discrepancy between the two methods as regards the proportion of leukemic cells in the marrow was often important dc-FISH detected a relevant proportion of BCR-ABL+ cells in three patients classified as complete cytogenetic responders and showed that, after 9-12 months of IFN treatment, a significant reduction of BCR-ABL+ cells was present in all the 20 patients tested. This might suggest that all CML patients are potentially responsive to IFN. Though more data are required, we think that dc-FISH is more informative than cytogenetic analysis for CML monitoring.

However, many of these patients experience a subsequent relapse. Multidimensional flow cytometry, which allows the discrimination of antigens expressed on normal and malignant cells, can detect small numbers of cancer cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood specimens. This technique enables the detection of one leukemic blast cell among 10(3) to 10(2) normal regenerating hematopoietic cells. PURPOSE: We determined whether the presence of residual leukemic blast cells, identified in the bone marrow of pediatric patients with AML by use of multidimensional flow cytometry, would be predictive of subsequent leukemic relapse. METHODS: Multidimensional flow cytometry was performed on 205 marrow specimens collected throughout the course of treatment from 39 patients who had achieved morphologic remission. The analyses employed monoclonal antibodies directed against CD45 in combination with mixed pairs of monoclonal antibodies directed against 10 other antigens. A time-varying Cox regression analysis that controlled for sample time intervals, age, sex, morphologic classification of disease, and white blood cell count at diagnosis was used to relate the multidimensional flow cytometric results to the risk of relapse after achieving remission. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Thirty-five of the 39 patients had bone marrow specimens available from the time that first morphologic remission was achieved. Leukemic blast cells were detected in the specimens from 19 (54%) of these 35 patients. Twenty-five of the 35 patients did not receive an allogeneic (i.e., from a different genetic background) bone marrow transplant during first morphologic remission, and 13 of 14 with residual leukemic cells experienced a relapse at a median time of 153 days after diagnosis (range, 48-863 days). Nine of the 11 patients who did not receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and lacked evidence of leukemic blast cells at first morphologic remission relapsed at a median time of 413 days after diagnosis (range, 321-794 days). Among the 10 individuals who received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant during first morphologic remission, five were positive for leukemic blast cells and five were negative; one of these patients (positive for leukemic blast cells) experienced a relapse 265 days after diagnosis, and three others died of transplant-related complications. The estimated risk of relapse during intervals of multidimensional flow cytometric positivity (i.e., intervals of remission for which the immediately preceding cytometry measurement was positive) was 2.8 times greater than that during negative intervals (95% confidence interval = 1.1-7.0; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Multidimensional flow cytometry identifies residual leukemia in more than half of the patients with AML who are in morphologic remission. The detection of leukemic blast cells in these patients by multidimensional flow cytometry is predictive of a more rapid relapse.","['Sievers, E L', 'Lange, B J', 'Buckley, J D', 'Smith, F O', 'Wells, D A', 'Daigneault-Creech, C A', 'Shults, K E', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Loken, M R']","['Sievers EL', 'Lange BJ', 'Buckley JD', 'Smith FO', 'Wells DA', 'Daigneault-Creech CA', 'Shults KE', 'Bernstein ID', 'Loken MR']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk']",1996/10/16 00:00,1996/10/16 00:01,['1996/10/16 00:00'],"['1996/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.20.1483 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Oct 16;88(20):1483-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.20.1483.,,,['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is known to be degraded during apoptosis. PARP as a substrate is cleaved by the Yama protease, encoded by the CPP32beta/Yama gene. Yama belongs to the interleukin 1beta converting enzyme/ced-3 family of cysteine proteases that are activated as a cascade, producing proteolytic cleavage of specific substrates that results in the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis. In the present studies, we determined the effect of high intracellular levels of the antiapoptosis Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL protein on Yama protease activation and PARP degradation during Ara-C-induced apoptosis. For this, we utilized HL-60/Bcl-2, HL-60/Bcl-xL, or control HL-60/neo cells, which were created by transfection of the cDNA of the bcl-2, bcl-xL, or the neomycin-resistant genes, respectively. As compared to HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcl-2 and HL-60/Bcl-xL cells have 5-fold greater expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively. However, these cell lines have similar levels of p32Yama and PARP. Treatment with 10 or 100 microM Ara-C for 4 h produced DNA fragmentation and morphological features of apoptosis in HL-60/neo cells. This was associated with the cleavage and activation of p32Yama and PARP degradation but not with the induction of Yama mRNA. In contrast, in HL-60/Bcl-2 and HL-60/ Bcl-xL cells, Ara-C-induced p32Yama activation by its cleavage, PARP degradation and apoptosis were significantly inhibited. High Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels in these cells also inhibited Yama protease activity, PARP degradation, and apoptosis due to clinically relevant concentrations of etoposide and mitoxantrone. These results suggest that the activation of the Yama protease and PARP degradation are involved in Ara-C-, etoposide-, or mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis. In addition, they suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL antagonize drug-induced apoptosis by a mechanism that interferes in the activity of a key cysteine protease that is involved in the execution of apoptosis.","['Ibrado, A M', 'Huang, Y', 'Fang, G', 'Liu, L', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ibrado AM', 'Huang Y', 'Fang G', 'Liu L', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (N-acetyl-tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl chloromethyl ketone)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 15;56(20):4743-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is still not fully understood. To study if the decrease in hematopoiesis in HCL is accompanied by abnormal concentrations of growth factors, we investigated the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of eight patients with HCL. The results point to a severe deficiency of production of all cytokines tested as compared to healthy donors. However, enrichment of autologous monocytes by counterflow centrifugation resulted in a marked increase of the levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The most pronounced effects were seen with IL-6. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that pokeweed mitogen, IFN-alpha, and poly(I:C) are capable of inducing the expression of IL-6-specific mRNA in HCL cells. These findings are substantiated on the protein level by immunofluorescence analysis. Incubation of PBMCs with IFN-alpha resulted in a significant increase of intracellular IL-6 in HCL but not in healthy donors. This increase was also seen in hairy cells positive for CD19 and CDllc. Furthermore, IFN-alpha induced the secretion of IL-6 from PBMCs of HCL patients but not healthy donors. In conclusion, our studies with PBMCs from patients with HCL revealed an inadequate supply of hematopoietic growth factors that might, in part, be due to the monocytopenia characteristic for this disease. The findings also indicate that IFN-alpha is capable of inducing the production of IL-6 in the patients' PBMCs as well as in their hairy cells. These data from our in vitro studies support the clinical observation that treatment with IFN-alpha leads to reconstitution of hematopoiesis.","['Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Hilgarth, M', 'Nguyen, S T', 'Shehata, M', 'Gruber, G', 'Spittler, A', 'Willheim, M', 'Boltz-Nitulescu, G', 'Hocker, P', 'Berger, R']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Hilgarth M', 'Nguyen ST', 'Shehata M', 'Gruber G', 'Spittler A', 'Willheim M', 'Boltz-Nitulescu G', 'Hocker P', 'Berger R']","['Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine I, Ludwig-Boltzmann Institute for Cytokine Research, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD11 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 15;56(20):4679-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hemin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX), a potential source of pro-oxidant iron in bone marrow, on in vitro photodynamic inactivation of leukemia cells. Murine L1210 cells exhibited a progressive loss of clonogenicity when irradiated with broad-band visible light in the presence of MC540. Hemin had strikingly different effects on photokilling, depending on its contact time with cells, eliciting a sizable decrease in resistance after short-term (30-min) contact but a marked increase in resistance after long-term (24-h) contact. Similar trends were observed when cells were challenged with glucose/glucose oxidase, indicating that the responses apply to more than one type of oxidative stress. Immunoblot analyses revealed that the levels of inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and ferritin heavy (H) chain were substantially elevated 24 h after hemin addition. HO-1 increased relatively rapidly and maximized within 4 h after adding hemin, whereas H-ferritin increased more slowly in parallel with the development of hyperresistance, maximizing after 24-36 h. Desferrioxamine, an avid iron chelator, had no effect on HO-1 induction but inhibited both ferritin induction and the increase in cell resistance, suggesting that HO-mediated release of iron from hemin was necessary for triggering these responses. Spleen apoferritin was taken up by L1210 cells and strongly inhibited photokilling, further implicating ferritin involvement in hyperresistance. Photokilling was accompanied by free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactivity), which could be suppressed substantially by 24-h hemin preincubation. A plausible explanation for the long-term effects of hemin is that excess H-ferritin generated as a result of iron-regulatory protein deactivation sequesters toxic iron, which might otherwise catalyze damaging lipid peroxidation. Chronic oxidative release of hemin from bone marrow erythroid cells could compromise the efficacy of photopurging by making tumor cells more tolerant to photooxidative insult.","['Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '0 (ferric 8-hydroxyquinoline)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9013-31-4 (Apoferritins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antidotes/pharmacology', 'Apoferritins/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Ferric Compounds/pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/biosynthesis', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 15;56(20):4636-43.,,,['1-PO1 CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the maximum induction of Bcl-2 by LMP1 takes about 48-72 h. We show in this report that up-regulation of the Bcl-2 homologue Mcl-1 by LMP1 preceded the induction of Bcl-2 and that the up-regulation was transient; therefore, Mcl-1 levels decreased when Bcl-2 levels started to increase. This finding supports the hypothesis that Mcl-1 functions as a rapidly inducible, short-term effector of cell viability. LMP1 also blocked the decline in the Mcl-1 levels in response to apoptotic stimulation triggered by elevated cyclic AMP. This effect of LMP1 was associated with a delayed cell death in the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL41. The maintenance of Mcl-1 expression by LMP1 is likely to be a crucial immediate-early response that enables cells to survive until Bcl-2 can be up-regulated.","['Wang, S', 'Rowe, M', 'Lundgren, E']","['Wang S', 'Rowe M', 'Lundgren E']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*metabolism']",1996/10/15 00:00,1996/10/15 00:01,['1996/10/15 00:00'],"['1996/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 15;56(20):4610-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can elicit many but not all host changes seen in cancer cachexia, including loss of appetite, loss of body weight, and the induction of acute-phase protein synthesis. However, these cytokines are not always demonstrated in the circulation of the cancer patients. The inability to detect circulating cytokines may be due to their low rate of production, their short half-life and rapid clearance from plasma, or their mode of action (autocrine or paracrine). Different cytokines are induced to stimulate the same response. This is very different from hormonal regulation, where a hormone acts on a cell directly through a specific receptor without depending on other mediators. Specific antibodies including anti-IFN-gamma, anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 antibodies, as well as the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, have been used to reverse cancer cachexia. Overlapping physiologic activities make it unlikely that a single substance is the sole cause of cancer cachexia. It is hoped that further investigation on other cytokines and their possible relationships with hormones will help to clarify the mechanisms of cancer cachexia in the near future.","['Noguchi, Y', 'Yoshikawa, T', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Svaninger, G', 'Gelin, J']","['Noguchi Y', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Matsumoto A', 'Svaninger G', 'Gelin J']","['First Department of Surgery, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Surg Today,Surgery today,9204360,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Cachexia/*etiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Dinoprostone/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00311551 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Today. 1996;26(7):467-75. doi: 10.1007/BF00311551.,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
