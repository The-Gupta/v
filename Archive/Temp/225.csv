HHV-6 is secreted in saliva and in this study samples were examined prospectively for HHV-6 DNA in healthy children and those with malignancy. In a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a 287 bp outer fragment and 163 inner fragment of HHV-6 DNA were amplified. The resulting amplimer contained a Hind III restriction site present only in ""B"" type HHV-6 and this was used to identify the type of HHV-6 amplified.

The only apparent difference between these two groups was that the less frequently HHV-6-positive group was more often febrile and unwell with neutropaenia.

We have recently determined that LIF is expressed in the human endometrium in a menstrual cycle dependent manner. Maximal expression is observed between days 19 and 25 of the menstrual cycle, coinciding with the time of human implantation. In this study we have utilized purified cultures of human cytotrophoblasts to examine the effects of LIF on several morphologic and biochemical markers of the trophoblastic differentiation. We purified human cytotrophoblasts from term placentae and cultured them with and without LIF (10 ng/mL). The secretion of human CG, oncofetal fibronectin, and progesterone were measured at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Northern blot analysis was used to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of beta hCG and oncofetal fibronectin. We found that LIF markedly decreased trophoblast production of hCG protein at 72 and 96 h, as well as expression of beta hCG mRNA. LIF also significantly increased the expression of oncofetal fibronectin mRNA and secretion of the protein. LIF did not affect steroidogenic activity of cultured trophoblasts, as determined by progesterone production. These biochemical changes are characteristic of cytotrophoblast differentiation toward an anchoring extravillous phenotype. Thus, LIF appears to be an important regulator of human embryonic implantation by directly modulating trophoblast differentiation.","['Nachtigall, M J', 'Kliman, H J', 'Feinberg, R F', 'Olive, D L', 'Engin, O', 'Arici, A']","['Nachtigall MJ', 'Kliman HJ', 'Feinberg RF', 'Olive DL', 'Engin O', 'Arici A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/metabolism', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human/genetics', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/physiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.81.2.8636307 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1996 Feb;81(2):801-6. doi: 10.1210/jcem.81.2.8636307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that a secretory group II phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is the enzyme responsible for most of the AA released to the incubation medium. By using selective inhibitors for each of the PLA2s present in P388D1 macrophages, we demonstrate herein that the cytosolic group IV PLA2 (cPLA2) mediates accumulation of cell-associated AA during the early steps of P388D1 cell activation. The contribution of both cPLA2 and sPLA2 to AA release can be distinguished on the basis of the different spatial and temporal characteristics of activation and substrate preferences of the two phospholipase A2s (PLA2s). Furthermore, the results suggest the possibility that a functionally active cPLA2 may be necessary for sPLA2 to act. cPLA2 action precedes that of sPLA2, and overcoming cPLA2 inhibition by artificially increasing intracellular free AA levels restores extracellular AA release. Although this suggests cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2, selective inhibition of one other PLA2 present in these cells, namely the Ca2+-independent PLA2, does not block, but instead enhances receptor-coupled AA release. These data indicate that Ca2+-independent PLA2 does not mediate AA mobilization in P388D1 macrophages. Collectively, the results of this work suggest that each of the PLA2s present in P388D1 macrophages serves a distinct role in cell activation and signal transduction.","['Balsinde, J', 'Dennis, E A']","['Balsinde J', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Rats', '*Signal Transduction']",1996/03/22 00:00,1996/03/22 00:01,['1996/03/22 00:00'],"['1996/03/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/22 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.12.6758 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45031-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 22;271(12):6758-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.12.6758.,,,,"['GM 20501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings strongly suggest that c-Cbl is implicated in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways, including those of EGF receptor and Src protein, as well as in the signaling pathways of hematopoietic cells.","['Odai, H', 'Sasaki, K', 'Hanazono, Y', 'Ueno, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Mitani, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Odai H', 'Sasaki K', 'Hanazono Y', 'Ueno H', 'Tanaka T', 'Miyagawa K', 'Mitani K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'src Homology Domains']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096852501 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03303.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1995 Dec;86(12):1119-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03303.x.,,,,,PMC5920666,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of SWA11.dgA were evaluated in vitro against the B-precursor leukemia cell line REH, the non-B-non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line NALM-6 and the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL-2 and BL-38. Binding of SWA11 to the CD24 antigen was assessed by flow cytometry demonstrating high affinity of the MAb for all cell lines tested.

SWA11.dgA was subsequently used for the treatment of disseminated human BL-38 Burkitt's lymphoma in a newly developed SCID mouse model. The mean survival time (MST) of BL-38-bearing SCID mice was extended from 23 days in untreated controls to more than 230 days when 6 microg SWA11.dgA was applied intraperitoneally one day after tumor challenge. All of the animals achieved continuous complete remissions. SCID mice treated with SWA11.dgA 4 days after tumor cell challenge or a reduced dose of SWA11.dgA (67%) also had a significantly extended MST (45.0 and 51.4 days, respectively, as compared to 22.7 and 23.1 days in the controls).

LIF was originally described as a differentiation factor of a murine leukemia cell line and was subsequently found to possess a broad spectrum of biological functions. Although LIF has been extensively studied in the hematopoietic system, little is known about its effects in solid tumors. We investigated the role of LIF in breast, kidney and prostate cancers. Using a clonogenic assay, we found that LIF significantly stimulated proliferation of 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47-D) in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 ng/ml. This effect was observed both in the presence of FCS and under serum- and estrogen-free culture conditions, suggesting that the effect of LIF is direct and does not depend on estrogen or any other cytokine. Neither line produced LIF protein, as assessed by ELISA. In contrast, the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer line MDA MB-231 produced LIF but did not respond to either LIF or its neutralizing antibodies. Similarly, increasing concentrations of LIF did not affect the growth of primary kidney (A-498), metastatic kidney (ACHN) and prostate (DU 145) cancer cell lines. These lines produce LIF, however, and antibodies to LIF significantly suppressed their proliferation, suggesting that they were maximally stimulated by the endogenously produced cytokine. Taken together, our data suggest that LIF acts as either a paracrine or an autocrine growth factor for breast, kidney and prostate cancers.","['Kellokumpu-Lehtinen, P', 'Talpaz, M', 'Harris, D', 'Van, Q', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Estrov, Z']","['Kellokumpu-Lehtinen P', 'Talpaz M', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/16 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/16 00:00'],"['1996/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960516)66:4<515::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960516)66:4<515::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 May 16;66(4):515-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960516)66:4<515::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scattered cells of the medial septum/diagonal band were positively stained following direct injection into this region. More intense staining of the basal forebrain was observed following hippocampal injection as a result of retrograde transport of the virus as shown by PCR analysis of viral DNA. Hippocampal injection also resulted in positive cell staining in several other afferent projection nuclei, namely, the supramammillary bodies, dorsal and caudal linear raphe, and perirhinal/entorhinal cortex. Very few cells were labeled around injection sites in the striatum or substantia nigra.

The alpha chain binds GM-CSF specifically with low affinity, and the binding is converted to high affinity when the alpha chain is associated with the beta chain. To date, there are at least six isoforms described for the GM-CSFR alpha, all involving alternative splicing at the 3' end, which alters the coding region and hence the protein produced. To detect variants at the 5' end of the GM-CSFR alpha mRNA, RNAse protection and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were performed using a probe spanning nucleotides 102-392 and pairs of primers covering exons 1-4. in addition to the expected full-length transcript, two mRNAs were detected, one containing a deletion of 24 nucleotides by alternative splicing at the 3' end of exon 2 (exon 2b-deleted isoform) and another in which exon 2 was completely deleted (exon 2-deleted isoform). Together, the isoforms were more highly expressed form). Together, the isoforms were more highly expressed than the full-length sequence (TF-1 cells: full-length 36 +/- 2.8% vs. exon 2-deleted isoforms 64 +/- 5.5%). These isoforms were detected in primary hematopoietic cells, blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and malignant cell lines and the relative mRNA expression for the isoforms, was always similar to that of TF-1 cells. As sequences in the 5'untranslated region can be involved in the modulation of translational efficiency, translation of constructs constructs corresponding to these exon 2 deleted isoforms was assessed using an in vitro reticulocyte lysate system. Deletion of exon 2 resulted in significantly lower in vitro translation of the receptor protein relative to the full-length sequence (53, 56, and 76% in three separate batches of reticulocytes), while deletion of exon 2b resulted in higher translation of the sequence (164, 128, and 305%; p = 0.01).

To study this growth dependence on stroma, we selected the M1 myeloblast clone, since its stroma dependence is reminiscent of that exhibited by hematopoietic stem cells. Conditioned medium form a stromal cell line, prepared under serum-free conditions, contained an activity that induced the proliferation of M1 cells and was therefore designated M1 myeloid activity (MMA). Among the various cytokines tested for MMA-like activity, only transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were found to affect M1 cell survival, and the two cytokines acted synergistically to induce M1 cell growth. Antibodies to both TGF-beta and M-CSF abolished most, but not all, of the MMA in the medium conditioned by stromal cells, indicating that additional factors contribute to MMA. A subclone of M1 cells, M1/M2, selected in medium conditioned by stroma, was found to respond to stromal stimulation but was unable to proliferate in fetal calf serum (FCS). Neutralization experiments indicated that M1/2 cell growth depended mainly on M-CSF and also partially on TGF-beta. By contrast, the same neutralizing antibodies did not affect the ability of serum to support M1 cell growth. The molecules that promoted leukemia cell growth in serum seemed therefore to differ from those provided by stroma.

We have shown that 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride (ML-9), an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, induces differentiation of monocytoid leukemia cell lines U937 and THP-1 but not of myeloblastic leukemic ML-1 cell or erythroleukemia K562 cells. In the present study, we further analyzed the effect of ML-9 in comparison with that of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) a typical inducer of monocytic differentiation. ML-9 induced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity of U937 cell more rapidly than VD3: This differentiation marker was induced significantly after incubation with ML-9 and VD3 for 4 hours and 1 day, respectively. ML-9 also induced alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) activity, another monocytic differentiation marker, more rapidly than VD3. The maximum levels of these markers induced by ML-9 were comparable to those induced by VD3, but after removal of ML-9 from the medium by washing the cells, the expressions of theses markers decreased within 4 hours and reached basal levels in 1 day, indicating that ML-9's induction of expression of differentiation-associated phenotypes was reversible. The growth inhibition of U937 cells by ML-9 was also reversible. Similar effects were observed in another line of human monoblastic cells, THP-1. ML-9 had little or no effect on the morphology of U937 cells but increased the expression of monocyte-macrophage lineage-associated surface antigen, CD14, to some extent. Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c-myc and upregulation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun, but ML-9 did not affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably. ML-9-induced differentiation was also reversible when the cells were cultured with cultured with ML-9 plus an anti-cancer drug such as 1-beta-D-arabino-furanosylcytosine or daunomycin. it became irreversible, however, upon simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which did not induce differentiation of U937 cells but caused growth arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Two types of somatic cells have been used: transcriptionally silent thymocytes, obtained from the thymus of newborn mice, and transcriptionally active murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) from in vitro culture. Cells were fused with activated oocytes, either less than 1 h, or 3 h post-ethanol-treatment. When the fusion occurred early after activation (1 h or less), the transferred somatic cell nuclei reacted by nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), which exposed their chromatin to the cytoplasmic environment of the oocytes, and the reconstituted nuclei underwent significant ultrastructural remodeling. No transcriptional activity was ever detected in these reconstituted nuclei during the subsequent 3-4 h of culture of the resulting hybrid cells. In the case of MEL, this means that transcriptional activity ceased as soon as they entered the cytoplasm. In contrast, somatic nuclei which entered the cytoplasm of activated oocytes 3 h postactivation did not undergo NEBD and their remodeling was less pronounced. In contrast to the first group, these nuclei were transcriptionally active during the following 3-4 h of culture. In both cases, the female pronucleus remained transcriptionally silent.","['Borsuk, E', 'Szollosi, M S', 'Besomebes, D', 'Debey, P']","['Borsuk E', 'Szollosi MS', 'Besomebes D', 'Debey P']","['Department of Embryology, Institut of Zoology, University of Warsaw, Poland. debey@ibpc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'Parthenogenesis', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/25 00:00,1996/05/25 00:01,['1996/05/25 00:00'],"['1996/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482796901603 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0160 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 May 25;225(1):93-101. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0160.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JMRD3 cell line is a VD3-resistant variant of RWLeu4 that was selected by continuous passage of RWLeu4 in the presence of VD3. The isolation of a spontaneous VD3-resistant variant suggests that phenotypically different cells exist within the RWLeu4 cell population. Therefore, single-cell clones of RWLeu4 cells were isolated and characterized. Four clonal cell populations that fall into three groups differing in response to the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing actions of VD3 were examined. Surprisingly, the extent of response of the clones to VD3 does not show a correlation with the basal level of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). RWLeu4-3 and RWLeu4-4 are the clones most sensitive to the antiproliferative actions of VD3 (ED50 approximately equal to 1 nM); however, RWLeu4-3 expresses basal levels of VDRs similar to those found in the parental cells and the RWLeu4-2 clone, while in RWLeu4-4, VD3 binding and VDR protein are below the limits of detection. Furthermore, RWLeu4-10 expresses the highest basal level of VDR protein but is relatively resistant to the antiproliferative actions of VD3 (ED50 > or = 30 nM). Like JMRD3, RWLeu4-10 is still capable of differentiating in response to VD3, as judged by the induction of biochemical processes and cell-surface antigen expression. Although VD3 treatment increases VDR protein levels and DNA-binding activity in all clones, altered DNA-protein complexes are detected in RWLeu4-4. Our results suggest that sensitivity to the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing actions of VD3 is not dependent solely upon the level of VDR expressed, but may also require posttranslational modification of the VDR or complex interactions with other nuclear transcription factors.","['Iwata, K', 'Kouttab, N', 'Ogata, H', 'Morgan, J W', 'Maizel, A L', 'Lasky, S R']","['Iwata K', 'Kouttab N', 'Ogata H', 'Morgan JW', 'Maizel AL', 'Lasky SR']","['Roger Williams Medical Center, Experimental Pathology Section, Department of Pathology and Laboratory, Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, RI 02908, USA. stephen_lasky@brown.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/25 00:00,1996/05/25 00:01,['1996/05/25 00:00'],"['1996/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90165-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0165 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 May 25;225(1):143-50. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0165.,,,,"['CA13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to untreated control cells, HL-60 cells expressed decreased levels of G (alpha S) protein and mRNA levels after addition of RA to the cultures as shown by immunoblot and Northern blot analysis. The reduction of the G (alpha S) protein in HL-60 cells by antisense RNA expression was associated with (i) decreased cell doubling time; (ii) induction of a granulocyte-like phenotype; (iii) and expression of a surface marker characteristic of myeloid differentiation. Expression of a constitutively active mutant G (alpha S) (Q227L) in HL-60 cells blocked RA-induced differentiation. In contrast, treatment with forskolin, prostaglandin E2, or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, which increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, did not inhibit the RA-mediated differentiation process. No changes in cAMP levels occurred in response to RA. The present study provides insights into the involvement of G (alpha S) protein in growth regulation during differentiation of the human myeloid cell line HL-60. These data suggest that in HL-60 human myeloid cells RA-mediated decrease of G (alpha S) plays a critical role in the regulation of differentiation which is independent of intracellular cAMP.","['Meissner, J D', 'Brown, G A', 'Mueller, W H', 'Scheibe, R J']","['Meissner JD', 'Brown GA', 'Mueller WH', 'Scheibe RJ']","['Zentrum Biochemie, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'RNA, Antisense', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/05/25 00:00,1996/05/25 00:01,['1996/05/25 00:00'],"['1996/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90162-7 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0162 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 May 25;225(1):112-21. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0162.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that two other T cell lines can undergo gain and loss of TCR/CD3 expression at similar rates. However, class I MHC molecules do not switch expression on and off, demonstrating that such switching is not an artifact of the analysis. To determine the mechanism for loss of surface TCR/CD3 expression, pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed on SUP-T13 TCR/CD3 negative cells. These analyses revealed that TCR alpha proteins are produced, but do not covalently associate with TCR beta-CD3 proteins in the negative cells.

We studied the potential applicability of PSK for preventing tumor progression using an experimental model of murine lymphoma. Mice inoculated with the radiation leukemia virus (RadLV) develop thymic lymphomas after a latency of 3-6 months. However, 2 weeks after virus inoculation, prelymphoma cells can already be detected in the thymus. We found that PSK treatment induced hyperresponsiveness to concanavalin A and heightened production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 in spleen cells of both control and prelymphoma mice. The response was transient and was accompanied with a dominant usage of T cells expressing V beta 8, but other T cell subsets were also stimulated by PSK. T lymphoma cells expressing V beta 8.2 underwent apoptosis when incubated with PSK. Treatment of RadLV-inoculated mice with PSK delayed the onset of overt lymphoma (and mortality) but could not protect the mice from the disease. Combined treatment with PSK and a RadLV-specific immunotoxin prevented synergistically the progression of the prelymphoma cells to frank lymphoma. The results suggest that PSK contains a superantigen-like component that selectively activates V beta 8+ T cells. Its administration prelymphoma mice interfered with the process of lymphoma progression.","['Yefenof, E', 'Gafanovitch, I', 'Oron, E', 'Bar, M', 'Klein, E']","['Yefenof E', 'Gafanovitch I', 'Oron E', 'Bar M', 'Klein E']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Age of Onset', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precancerous Conditions/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Proteoglycans/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*therapy', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*therapy']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01526559 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Dec;41(6):389-96. doi: 10.1007/BF01526559.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of Cancer and Leukemia Group B Protocol 8935.,2393-9,"BACKGROUND: The impact of sequential trimodality therapy on the pattern of first site disease failure in pathologic Stage IIIA (N2) nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was analyzed. METHODS: Seventy-four eligible patients with histologically documented Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC underwent sequential trimodality therapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Protocol 8935. Treatment consisted of 2 cycles of induction cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) (Days 1 and 29) and vinblastine at 5 mg/m2 i.v. weekly for 5 weeks followed by surgery. Surgery included a thoracotomy with resection of the primary tumor and hilar lymph nodes and a mediastinal lymph node dissection. Patients with resected disease then received an additional a cycles of cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 i.v. and vinblastine at 5 mg/m2 i.v. biweekly for 2 total of 4 doses followed by consolidative thoracic irradiation. Patients with completely resected disease received 54 Gray (Gy) whereas those with incompletely resected disease received 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction (fx) once a day. Patients with unresectable disease underwent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) treatments only to 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fx without any additional chemotherapy. Disease recurrence was determined by clinical, radiographic, or histologic criteria. Pattern of disease failure was identified by site of involvement at first recurrence as indicated by the CALGB Respiratory Follow-Up Form. RESULTS: Sixty-three of the 74 patients completed the induction chemotherapy as planned. Forty-six of the 63 patients underwent resection of disease whereas the remaining 17 were unresectable. Thirty-three of the 46 resected patients completed the entire adjuvant postoperative chemoradiation treatment as planned. Ten of 17 patients with unresectable disease completed postsurgical TRT. At a median follow-up interval of 27 months (range, 4-43), the 3-year overall survival and failure-free survival were 23% and 18%, respectively, for all 74 eligible patients. Overall, disease failure has occurred in 52 (70%) of the 74 eligible patients: local only: 13 (25%); distant only: 16 (31%); and both local and distant: 23 (44%), (P = not significant [NS]). Ten patients progressed during induction chemotherapy: local only: six patients; and both local and distant failure: four patients. Twenty-eight of 46 resected patients recurred: local only: 1 (4%); both local and distant failure: 11 (39%); and distant only: 16 (57%); (P < 0.001). Disease progression occurred in 14 of 17 patients with unresectable disease: local only: 6; both local and distant sites: 8. Among the 52 total patients experiencing disease relapse, isolated or combined local failure occurred commonly among patients during induction chemotherapy (n = 10, [28%]), in those with unresectable disease (n = 14, [39%]), or in those with resected disease (n = 12, [33%]), (P = NS). However, isolated or combined distant failure was more likely to occur among patients with resected disease (n = 27, [69%]) than either during induction chemotherapy (n = 4, [10%]) or in those with unresected disease (n = 8, [21%]), (P < 0.05). Among patients who relapsed, brain metastases occurred in 13 of 52 (25%) patients overall and in 12 of 28 (43%) patients with resected disease. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, disease failure was just as likely to occur in local, distant, or combined sites on CALGB Protocol 8935 using sequential trimodality therapy in the treatment of pathologic Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC: Isolated or combined local failure occurred commonly during sequential tri-modality therapy whereas isolated or combined distant relapse was prevalent among patients with resected disease. In addition, isolated local failure was rare among patients with resected disease. The pattern of disease failure on CALGB Protocol 8935 reflects the biology of locoregional NSCLC as much as the therapeutic impact of trimodality therapy.","['Kumar, P', 'Herndon, J 2nd', 'Langer, M', 'Kohman, L J', 'Elias, A D', 'Kass, F C', 'Eaton, W L', 'Seagren, S L', 'Green, M R', 'Sugarbaker, D J']","['Kumar P', 'Herndon J 2nd', 'Langer M', 'Kohman LJ', 'Elias AD', 'Kass FC', 'Eaton WL', 'Seagren SL', 'Green MR', 'Sugarbaker DJ']","['University of Tennessee Memphis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology/secondary', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', '*Pneumonectomy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thoracotomy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",1996/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960601)77:11<2393::AID-CNCR31>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960601)77:11<2393::AID-CNCR31>3.0.CO;2-Q [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Jun 1;77(11):2393-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960601)77:11<2393::AID-CNCR31>3.0.CO;2-Q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the small number of patients reported, information regarding side effects is limited, and therefore warrants further evaluation. METHODS: Twenty eligible patients with NHL and chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), resistant to or relapsed after previous protocols of polychemotherapy were treated with oral etoposide at a dosage of 50 mg/m2/day for 21 days in a 28-day cycle. Response and toxicity were evaluated according to standard criteria. RESULTS: Total response was noted in 13 patients, complete response in 2 patients, and partial response in 11 patients. Two patients had stable disease and five patients had progression of disease during treatment. Seventy-five percent of patients experienced neutropenia below 1500/microL.

METHODS: Human recombinant IL-4 provided by Schering-Plough Research Corporation was administered subcutaneously to 19 patients at a dose of 1 microgram/kg three times per week. Eligibility included Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 2 or better, adequate hematologic (leukocyte count < or = 2500/microliters platelets < or = 75,000/microliters), renal (creatinine < or = 2.0 mg/dl), and hepatic (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase < or = 3 times the upper limit of normal) function. Exclusion criteria included prior immunotherapy, clinically significant diabetes, pulmonary disease, and history of congestive heart failure or an ejection fraction of less than 40%. Soluble CD23 was measured in prospectively collected serum via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. RESULTS: There was one minor response among 18 evaluable patients and median survival was only 35 weeks. Toxicities included fever, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, and anorexia. One patient each experienced a 14% asymptomatic decrease in the cardiac ejection fraction, a gastrointestinal bleed, and oral angioedema. Ten patients noted increased pain in tumor bearing areas, especially in areas of bony disease. Two patients with pre-existing vertebral disease experienced symptoms of cord compression. In 12 patients for whom complete data were available there was a mean increase in soluble CD23 of 2.6 ng/ml (P = 0.002) 1-2 weeks after therapy initiation. CONCLUSIONS: At this modest dose and schedule, IL-4 was tolerated in most patients. There was minimal biologic and clinical activity. Further development of IL-4 as a therapeutic agent in metastatic renal cell cancer at this dose and schedule is not supported by this study.","['Stadler, W M', 'Rybak, M E', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Stadler WM', 'Rybak ME', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interleukin-4/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Solubility']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951101)76:9<1629::aid-cncr2820760920>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Nov 1;76(9):1629-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951101)76:9<1629::aid-cncr2820760920>3.0.co;2-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlations with patient and disease characteristics and with prognosis.,1564-70,"BACKGROUND: The expression of myeloid markers on lymphoblasts has been associated with adverse outcome in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The purpose of the study was to analyze the experience with adults treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with myeloid marker- (MY) positive ALL in relation to patient and disease characteristics, response to therapy, and prognosis. METHODS: Since 1988, 64 of 162 adults (40%) with newly diagnosed ALL referred to our service had MY-positive ALL. Their characteristics and outcomes were compared with the 98 patients with MY-negative ALL. Patients were treated with the vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (VAD) regimens. RESULTS: Patients with MY-positive ALL were significantly older (median ages, 47 years vs. 33 years; P = 0.03), had a higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression (59% vs. 36%; P < 0.01), and a lower incidence of common acute leukemia antigen expression (50% vs. 71%; P < 0.01), serum alkaline phosphatase elevation (58% vs. 83%; P < 0.01), and thrombocytopenia at diagnosis (49% vs. 69%; P = 0.02). Myeloid marker positivity, as expected, was significantly higher in null cell ALL (82%), and significantly lower in mature B-cell ALL (17%) (P < 0.01). Forty-one of 64 MY-positive patients achieved complete remission (CR) after induction therapy compared with 76 of 98 patients MY-negative disease (CR rate 64% vs. 78%; P = 0.06). With a median follow-up of 45 months, no statistical differences were observed in remission duration or survival between MY-positive and MY-negative patients, overall, and within immunophenotypic subsets (T-cell vs. others), or among subgroups with single marker (CD13, CD14, CD33, CD34) positivity. The 3-year remission duration rates were 32% for MY-negative and 40% for MY-positive patients (P not significant), and 3-year survival rates were 26% and 31%, respectively (P not significant). CONCLUSIONS: With VAD therapy, myeloid marker positivity is not associated with significant differences in prognosis in adult ALL.","['Preti, H A', 'Huh, Y O', ""O'Brien, S M"", 'Andreeff, M', 'Pierce, S T', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Preti HA', 'Huh YO', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Andreeff M', 'Pierce ST', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

Pregnancy in patients with APL requires special consideration to maximize the probability of survival of both mother and fetus. METHODS: A patient with APL diagnosed during pregnancy who developed DIC is described. Obstetric and oncologic management of this difficult patient is discussed, and a pertinent literature review of pregnancy in APL is presented. RESULTS: Of 23 pregnancies in patients with APL reported in the literature (including the present patient), 19 yielded live births, including 8 of 12 who received chemotherapy during late pregnancy and all 3 patients who received all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) during late pregnancy. Chemotherapy or ATRA induced complete remission in 72% of treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Proper management of pregnant patients with APL usually results in a live birth and complete remission of the mother's leukemia, despite the potentially devastating consequences of DIC, which is present at diagnosis in most patients.","['Hoffman, M A', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Kleiner, G J']","['Hoffman MA', 'Wiernik PH', 'Kleiner GJ']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/pathology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Prenatal Care', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951201)76:11<2237::aid-cncr2820761109>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Dec 1;76(11):2237-41. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951201)76:11<2237::aid-cncr2820761109>3.0.co;2-f.,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the interaction of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) and ATRA in affecting the proliferation and differentiation of NB4 cells. METHODS: Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction was used as a functional marker of leukemia cell differentiation. The number of viable cells was counted by trypan blue exclusion test. RESULTS: Proliferation of NB4 cells increased when exposed to 10(-9)M of ATRA, but reduced progressively when exposed to ATRA at the concentrations of 10(-8)M to 10(-6)M. After culture for 5 days, NBT-positive cell was not detectable in the control cultures with medium alone, but its percentage apparently increased to 84% at 10(-7)M ATRA. Granulocyte (G)-CSF per se had no effect on the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells, but it could enhance the NBT reduction when used in combination with various concentrations (10(-9)M -10(-6)M) of ATRA. Interleukin (IL)-3 or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) alone also had no effect on the NBT reduction in NB4 cells. However, when combined with ATRA, both caused a slight suppression of NBT reduction. No synergistic effect was noted between IL-3 and G-CSF on the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF, but not IL-3 or GM-CSF, can enhance the differentiating activity of ATRA. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate its clinical use.","['Hsu, H C', 'Tsai, W H', 'Hsu, M L', 'Ho, C H', 'Wang, S Y']","['Hsu HC', 'Tsai WH', 'Hsu ML', 'Ho CH', 'Wang SY']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1996 Feb;57(2):93-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses were performed on individual clones of transfected cells induced to differentiate with hexamethylenbisacetamide (HMBA). The results showed that there was a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin produced, in inverse relationship with the level of H-subunit overexpression. Incorporation of [2-14C]glycine into heme was reduced by 20% t0 30% in the clones overexpressing H-ferritin subunit compared with control clone. However, the reduction in hemoglobin production was not reversed by addition of heme precursors (delta-aminolevulinic acid or iron) or by hemin itself. A reduced accumulation of beta-globin mRNA was also observed, which could account for the impaired hemoglobin synthesis. Furthermore, synthesis of the endogenous L-ferritin subunit was greatly repressed. Gel retardation assays performed on cytoplasmic extracts of transfected cells using an iron-responsive element (IRE) as a probe revealed that in overexpressing cells, the iron-regulatory protein (IRP) had a conformation with a high RNA-binding affinity, thus leading to translational repression of the endogenous L-ferritin synthesis. These data suggest that an increased formation of H-rich isoferritins leads to a rapid chelation of the regulatory iron pool. While the mechanism underlying the reduction in beta-globin mRNA remains to be elucidated, this study provides direct evidence for the role of IRP-mediated regulation of ferritin expression in erythroid cell metabolism.","['Picard, V', 'Renaudie, F', 'Porcher, C', 'Hentze, M W', 'Grandchamp, B', 'Beaumont, C']","['Picard V', 'Renaudie F', 'Porcher C', 'Hentze MW', 'Grandchamp B', 'Beaumont C']","[""INSERM U409, Genetique et Pathologie Moleculaires de l'Hematopoiese, Faculte Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65319-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):2057-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of first complete remission (CR) differed both between C219+ and C219- cases and between JSB+ and JSB- ones (30.9% v 71.1% and 35.4% v 93.1%, respectively, P < .001). Of the 21 C219+ patients who had yielded a first CR, 19 (90.4%) relapsed, compared with 28 of 64 (43.7%) C219- patients (P < .001). Of the 28 JSB1+ patients in first CR, 17 (60.7%) relapsed relative to 8 (29.6%) of 27 JSBI- ones (P = .021). A higher rate of relapses among MDR+ compared with MDR- patients was observed both for C219 and JSB1 MoAbs taken separately (C219 80% v 44%; JSB1 52% v 27%), with no relationship to age. The survival rates (Kaplan-Meyer method) were significantly shorter both in C219+ patients and in JSB1+ cases (P < .001). Disease-free survival curves followed this same trend. The combination (C219- JSB1+) identified a subset of patients with an intermediate outcome compared to C219 positive cases. The prognostic value of both markers (C219 and JSB1) was confirmed in multivariate analysis. These results suggest that the assessment of MDR phenotype by flow cytometry may be an important predictor of treatment outcome.","['Del Poeta, G', 'Stasi, R', 'Aronica, G', 'Venditti, A', 'Cox, M C', 'Bruno, A', 'Buccisano, F', 'Masi, M', 'Tribalto, M', 'Amadori, S', 'Papa, G']","['Del Poeta G', 'Stasi R', 'Aronica G', 'Venditti A', 'Cox MC', 'Bruno A', 'Buccisano F', 'Masi M', 'Tribalto M', 'Amadori S', 'Papa G']","[""Cattedra e Divisione di Ematologia, Universita' Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.

The results also demonstrate the activation and cleavage of PKCdelta (1) is inhibited by expression of antiapoptotic proteins, and (2) is induced by camptothecin (CAM) and mitomycin C (MMC).

Thus far no reliable CSF tumor markers have been identified. CD27 is a transmembrane disulfide-linked 55-kD homodimer present on most peripheral blood T cells and on a subset of B cells. CD27 is also expressed on human malignant B cells and high levels of soluble CD27 can be present in the serum of patients with B-cell malignancies. The aim of this study is to determine prospectively the diagnostic value of CSF sCD27 as a tumor marker in patients with meningeal localization of lymphoid malignancies. CSF sCD27 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The optimal cut-off value using receiver operator characteristics curves was found to be 10 U/mL. sCD27 levels were normal in all 50 control patients (lumbar disc protrusion) and in 39 of 40 samples obtained from patients with either solid tumors or acute myeloid leukemia. Of 104 CSF samples from 70 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) undergoing routine central nervous system (CNS) staging, sCD27 was false positive and false negative in only one sample each. In 70 samples from 45 patients suspected of meningeal localization of ALL or NHL, the sCD27 test had an excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (82%). In 7 patients with positive CSF studied longitudinally, sCD27 levels correlated very well with remission and relapse. sCD27 levels were not nonspecifically increased by the administration of cytostatic drugs. Finally, sCD27 was also elevated in the 4 patients studied with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). CSF sCD27 is a promising tumor marker in patients with either meningeal localization of lymphoid malignancies or PCNSL, and can be useful in the differential diagnosis of CNS involvement by either lymphoid malignancies or solid tumors.","['Kersten, M J', 'Evers, L M', 'Dellemijn, P L', 'van den Berg, H', 'Portegies, P', 'Hintzen, R Q', 'van Lier, R A', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van Oers, R H']","['Kersten MJ', 'Evers LM', 'Dellemijn PL', 'van den Berg H', 'Portegies P', 'Hintzen RQ', 'van Lier RA', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van Oers RH']","['Department of Hematology and Neurology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Brain Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins/*analysis', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/cerebrospinal fluid']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65310-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1985-9.,,,,,,['Blood 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2818'],,,,,,,,,,,

The RARs require heterodimerization with RXRs; in addition, RXRs can form homodimers, which can bind to DNA response elements that are either distinct or the same as those bound by the RAR/RXR heterodimers. Therefore, the two retinoid pathways provide sequences that are specific for effective DNA binding and activation of target genes. We have developed several series of novel synthetic retinoids that selectively interact with RXR/RXR homodimers and RAR/RXR heterodimers. We show here that SR11236 and SR11246, which are RXR-selective analogs, had little ability to inhibit clonal growth and induce differentiation of leukemic cells (HL-60 cells and fresh acute myeloid leukemia cells). However, SR11249, SR11256, and LGD1069, which activated both RXR/RXR homodimers and RAR/RXR heterodimers, could inhibit clonal growth and induce differentiation of HL-60 cells as well as leukemic cells from patients, including those with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This is similar to results observed with RAR/RXR-specific ligands. Interestingly, the combination of ATRA and either SR11249, SR11256, or LGD1069 showed synergistic effects in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. A retinoid (SR11238) with strong anti-AP-1 activity that did not activate the RARs and RXRs for gene transcription from the response element TREpal was inactive in our assay systems, suggesting that the antiproliferative effects of retinoids on leukemic cells is not mediated by inhibiting the AP-1 pathway. We conclude that the RAR/RXR pathway is more important than RXR/RXR pathway for differentiation and proliferation of acute myeloid leukemic cells, and certain retinoids or combination of retinoids with both RAR and RXR specificities may synergistically enhance the differentiation activity of ATRA, which may be relevant in several clinical situations.","['Kizaki, M', 'Dawson, M I', 'Heyman, R', 'Elster, E', 'Morosetti, R', 'Pakkala, S', 'Chen, D L', 'Ueno, H', 'Chao, W', 'Morikawa, M', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Heber, D', 'Pfahl, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kizaki M', 'Dawson MI', 'Heyman R', 'Elster E', 'Morosetti R', 'Pakkala S', 'Chen DL', 'Ueno H', 'Chao W', 'Morikawa M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Heber D', 'Pfahl M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'A61RXM4375 (Bexarotene)']",IM,"['Bexarotene', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65309-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1977-84.,,,,"['CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we analyze 4,400+ ex vivo Differential Staining Cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay drug response results from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to investigate the development of drug resistance during treatment. Patients were untreated (n = 216) or previously treated with various cytotoxic agents (n = 188). Data was processed to identify ex vivo resistance (or sensitivity) induced by treating patients with prednisolone, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, anthracycline, or fludarabine. Induced resistance was apparently not associated with any one known mechanism. Treatment with chlorambucil induced a 10-fold sensitivity to steroids; cyclophosphamide induced greater resistance to anthracyclines than alkylating agents; anthracyclines induced greatest resistance to chlorambucil, cisplatin, carboplatin, and cladribine. Patients previously treated with at least two regimens were only 2.16-fold more resistant to CLL drugs than untreated patients, but had significantly reduced survival (median survival, 7.9 months compared with 61.1 months for untreated patients). These results suggest that chlorambucil and/or an antimetabolite should be administered before cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines to delay the onset of extensive pleiotropic drug resistance. Because individual differences in drug sensitivity are considerable, specific guidance could be obtained from ex vivo assay results. Furthermore, as a model for investigating drug resistance mechanisms, fresh CLL lymphocytes represent a useful alternative to drug-resistant cell lines.","['Bosanquet, A G', 'Bell, P B']","['Bosanquet AG', 'Bell PB']","['Bath Cancer Research Unit, School of Postgraduate Medicine, University of Bath, Royal United Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/classification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65307-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1962-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that t-RA treatment dramatically induced type II transglutaminase (type II TGase) expression in cells carrying the t(15;17) translocation and expressing the PML-RARalpha product such as the APL-derived NB4 cell line and fresh leukemic cells from APL patients. This induction correlated with t-RA-induced growth arrest, granulocytic differentiation, and upregulation of the leukocyte adherence receptor beta subunit (CD18) gene expression. The increase in type II TGase was not abolished by cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that synthesis of a protein intermediate was not required for the induction. t-RA did not significantly alter the rate of growth arrest and did not stimulate differentiation and type II TGase activity in NB4.306 cells, a t-RA-resistant subclone of the NB4 cell line, or in leukemic cells derived from two patients morphologically defined as APL but lacking the t(15;17). However, in NB4.306 cells, t-RA treatment was able to increase CD18 mRNA expression in a manner similar to NB4 cells. The molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of these genes were investigated. In NB4 cells, using novel receptor-selective ligands such as 9-cis-RA, TTNPB, AM580, and SR11217, we found that RAR- and RARalpha-selective retinoids were able to induce growth arrest, granulocytic differentiation, and type II TGase, whereas the RXR-selective retinoid SR11217 was inactive. Moreover, an RAR alpha-antagonist completely inhibited the expression of type II TGase and CD18 induced by these selective retinoids in NB4 cells. In NB4.306 cells, an RARalpha-dependent signaling pathway was found involved in the modulation of CD18 expression. In addition, expression of the PML-RARalpha gene in myeloid U937 precursor cells resulted in the ability of these cells to induce type II TGase in response to t-RA. On the basis of these results we hypothesize a specific involvement of a signaling pathway involving PML-RAR alpha for the induction of growth arrest, granulocytic differentiation, and type II TGase by retinoids in APL cells.","['Benedetti, L', 'Grignani, F', 'Scicchitano, B M', 'Jetten, A M', 'Diverio, D', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Avvisati, G', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Adamo, S', 'Levin, A A', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Nervi, C']","['Benedetti L', 'Grignani F', 'Scicchitano BM', 'Jetten AM', 'Diverio D', 'Lo Coco F', 'Avvisati G', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Adamo S', 'Levin AA', 'Pelicci PG', 'Nervi C']","['Institute of Histology and General Embryology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (CD 437)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '102121-60-8 (Am 580)', '146670-35-1 (SR 11217)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '71441-28-6', '(4-(2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic', 'acid)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fenretinide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/physiology', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Transglutaminases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65304-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1939-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTCP1 gene is involved in the t(X;14)(q28;q11) translocation associated with these T-cell proliferations. Alternative splicing generates type A and B transcripts that potentially encode two entirely distinct proteins; type A transcripts code for a small mitochondrial protein, p8MTCP1, and type B transcripts, containing an additional open reading frame, may code for 107 amino-acid protein, p13MTCP1. The recently cloned TCL1 gene, also involved in translocations and inversions associated with T-cell proliferations, codes for a 14-kD protein that displays significant homology with p13MTCP1. We have generated rabbit antisera against this putative p13MTCP1 protein and screened for expression of p13MTCP1 normal lymphoid tissues and 33 cases of immature and mature lymphoid T-cell proliferations using a sensitive Western blot assay. We also investigated the MTCP1 locus configuration by Southern blot analysis. The p13MTCP1 protein was detected in the three T-cell proliferations with MTCP1 rearrangements because of t(X;14) translocations, but neither in normal resting and activated lymphocytes nor in the other T-cell leukemias.

We have mapped breakpoints within the 8.3-kb BamHI breakpoint cluster region in 31 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo and in 8 t-AML patients. In 23 of 31 leukemia de novo patients, MLL breakpoints mapped to the centromeric half (4.57 kb) of the breakpoint cluster region, whereas those in eight de novo patients mapped to the telomeric half (3.87 kb). In contrast, only two t-AML breakpoints mapped in the centromeric half, whereas six mapped in the telomeric half. The difference in distribution of the leukemia de novo breakpoints is statistically significant (P = .02). A similar difference in distribution of breakpoints between de novo patients and t-AML patients has been reported by others. We identified a low- or weak-affinity scaffold attachment region (SAR) mapping just centromeric to the breakpoint cluster region, and a high-affinity SAR mapping within the telomeric half of the breakpoint cluster region. Using high stringency criteria to define in vitro vertebrate topoisomerase II (topo II) consensus sites, one topo II site mapped adjacent to the telomeric SAR, whereas six mapped within the SAR. Therefore, 74% of leukemia de novo and 25% of t-AML breakpoints map to the centromeric half of the breakpoint cluster region map between the two SARs; in contrast, 26% of the leukemia de novo and 75% of the t-AML patient breakpoints map to the telomeric half of the breakpoint cluster region that contains both the telomeric SAR and the topo II sites. Thus, the chromatin structure of the MLL breakpoint cluster region may be important in determining the distribution of the breakpoints. The data suggest that the mechanism(s) leading to translocations may differ in leukemia de novo and in t-AML.","['Broeker, P L', 'Super, H G', 'Thirman, M J', 'Pomykala, H', 'Yonebayashi, Y', 'Tanabe, S', 'Zeleznik-Le, N', 'Rowley, J D']","['Broeker PL', 'Super HG', 'Thirman MJ', 'Pomykala H', 'Yonebayashi Y', 'Tanabe S', 'Zeleznik-Le N', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Centromere/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Telomere/ultrastructure', 'Teniposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65301-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1912-22.,,,,"['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following our observations that A-myb is expressed in a restricted subset of normal mature human B lymphocytes, with the phenotype CD38+, CD39-, slgM-, we have now investigated the pattern of A-myb expression in neoplastic B cells representating the whole spectrum of B-cell differentiation and compared it to that of c-myb and B-myb. In a panel of 32 B-cell lines, A-myb was very strongly expressed in most Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines, but weak or negative in 2 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 6 Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 6 myeloma lines. Protein expression paralleled that of the RNA. We have also investigated A-myb expression in 49 fresh cases of B leukemias. Among 24 ALL, 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and all these were negative for A-myb expression; on the other hand, all 7 B-ALL cases (slg+), as well as one fresh BL case with bone marrow infiltration, expressed A-myb. A-myb was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic leukemias (PLL) but was strongly expressed in 5/20 (25%) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples. In the latter A-myb did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage. Finally, we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into Richter's syndrome and have found that the Richter's cells expressed about 25-fold less A-myb RNA than the CLL cells from the same patient. The pattern of c-myb and B-myb was clearly distinct from that of A-myb. C-myb and B-myb were expressed in all neoplastic groups, except in CLL cells. Thus, A-myb expression, unlike that of c-myb and B-myb, is restricted to a subset of B-cell neoplasias (in particular BL and slg+B-ALL) representative of a specific stage of B-cell differentiation. This expression may in part reflect expression of A-myb by the normal germinal center B cells that are the normal counterpart of these transformed B cells. The data presented strongly support a role for this transcription factor in B-cell differentiation and perhaps in B-cell transformation in some neoplasias.","['Golay, J', 'Luppi, M', 'Songia, S', 'Palvarini, C', 'Lombardi, L', 'Aiello, A', 'Delia, D', 'Lam, K', 'Crawford, D H', 'Biondi, A', 'Barbui, T', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Introna, M']","['Golay J', 'Luppi M', 'Songia S', 'Palvarini C', 'Lombardi L', 'Aiello A', 'Delia D', 'Lam K', 'Crawford DH', 'Biondi A', 'Barbui T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M']","['Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYBL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Syndrome', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65300-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1900-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if abnormal usage of VH genes contributes to this immunodeficiency, the usage of VH genes was determined in peripheral blood B cells of four BMT recipients, two of whom had developed chronic graft versus host disease. The pattern of usage of VH3 or VH4 genes assessed at either 90 days or approximately 1 year after transplant was similar to that observed in healthy subjects and was marked by the over utilization of two elements, one VH3 and one VH4. However, the repertoires of each of the four BMT recipients appeared to be less complex than the repertoires of healthy subjects. The differences were a consequence of the accumulation of somatic mutations among rearrangements in the controls but not in the BMT recipients. The failure to accumulate somatic mutations in rearranged VH genes is consistent with a defect in antigen driven B-cell responses. These results indicate the although the VH gene content of the repertoire has normalized by 90 days posttransplant, a maturational arrest in B-cell differentiation associated with antigen activation persists for at least 1 year after BMT.","['Suzuki, I', 'Milner, E C', 'Glas, A M', 'Hufnagle, W O', 'Rao, S P', 'Pfister, L', 'Nottenburg, C']","['Suzuki I', 'Milner EC', 'Glas AM', 'Hufnagle WO', 'Rao SP', 'Pfister L', 'Nottenburg C']","['Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['*Antibody Formation', 'Antigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*etiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65297-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1873-80.,['Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):350-1.

CNTF also potentiates IL-1-induced serum IL-6. Here, we report that four other cytokines (leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], oncostatin M [OSM], interleukin-11 and cardiotrophin-1) also potentiated the elevation of serum corticosterone and IL-6 levels induced by IL-1. Furthermore, all the six cytokines studied induced the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A when administered alone. Because these cytokines differ both in structure and in function, but share gp130 as a subunit of their receptors, these results indicate that signaling through gp130 mediates potentiation of IL-1 activities. The potentiation of IL-1-induced serum corticosterone levels is not a consequence of the increased serum IL-6 observed after IL-1 administration. In fact, in IL-6 deficient mice, IL-1 increased serum corticosterone to a level comparable to that observed in wild-type mice. Thus, either endogenous IL-6 does not mediate IL-1-induced corticosterone increase, or its role may be fulfilled by other cytokines. To the extent that gp130-dependent cytokines may serve this role, they may be important feedback regulators of inflammation through the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the potentiation of acute-phase protein synthesis.","['Benigni, F', 'Fantuzzi, G', 'Sacco, S', 'Sironi, M', 'Pozzi, P', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Sipe, J D', 'Poli, V', 'Cappelletti, M', 'Paonessa, G', 'Pennica, D', 'Panayotatos, N', 'Ghezzi, P']","['Benigni F', 'Fantuzzi G', 'Sacco S', 'Sironi M', 'Pozzi P', 'Dinarello CA', 'Sipe JD', 'Poli V', 'Cappelletti M', 'Paonessa G', 'Pennica D', 'Panayotatos N', 'Ghezzi P']","['Division of Geographic Medicine and Infectious Diseases, New England Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/*physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Corticosterone/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65294-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1851-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These difficulties preclude the application of standard molecular genetic approaches to these problems. As an alternative approach we have introduced a lacZ-containing promoter-trap retrovirus into hematopoietic cells. We used the interleukin-3-dependent mouse myeloid progenitor cell 32D as a model to identify transcriptionally active genes. The frequency of integrations that led to transcription of the lacZ gene was estimated to be 0.5% of all integrations, of which 14% were downregulated on differentiation of 32D cells towards neutrophils. Thus, one in every 1,000 to 2,000 integrations identified a developmentally regulated gene. Cellular DNA sequences upstream of proviral integrations were isolated by inverse polymerase chain reaction. Five were further characterized and we confirmed by RNA expression analysis that they were downregulated on differentiation.

To overcome this, a bicistronic recombinant retrovirus has been generated that delivers both a therapeutic glucocerebrosidase (GC) cDNA for the treatment of Gaucher disease, and a small murine cell surface antigen (heat-stable antigen [HSA]) as a selectable marker. An amphotropic retroviral-producing cell clone was created, and filtered supernatant was used to transduce NIH 3T3 cells. Sorting of transduced cells by flow cytometry enabled separation into populations based on cell surface fluorescence intensity derived from the expressed HSA. Significant increases in GC enzyme activity were seen for the transduced and especially the transduced and sorted cells. Similarly, increases in GC specific activity were seen in transduced and sorted skin fibroblasts from a patient with Gaucher disease. To streamline future transfer and sorting protocols for hematopoietic cells, transformed B-cell lines from Gaucher patients were created. Type I B cells were transduced and sorted, and large increases in GC specific activity occurred with concomitant increases in integrated retroviral copy numbers. In addition, toward the goal of using this selectable approach for corrective gene transfer to bone marrow stem cells, CD34+ cells were isolated from normal BM donors, transduced, and sorted based on cell surface expression of HSA. Proviral DNA was detected in approximately 40% of clonogenic progenitor colonies derived from unsorted, transduced CD34+ cells, demonstrating the high titer of the vector. However, after sorting, 100% of the colonies had the corrective GC cDNA, demonstrating the efficiency of this selective system for human hematopoietic progenitors. It is expected that strategies based on this approach will allow sorting of transduced cells of many types before implantation of transduced cells to animals or patients. This vector system may also be used to simplify manipulations and studies on retroviral-mediated gene delivery in vitro and for in vivo models.","['Medin, J A', 'Migita, M', 'Pawliuk, R', 'Jacobson, S', 'Amiri, M', 'Kluepfel-Stahl, S', 'Brady, R O', 'Humphries, R K', 'Karlsson, S']","['Medin JA', 'Migita M', 'Pawliuk R', 'Jacobson S', 'Amiri M', 'Kluepfel-Stahl S', 'Brady RO', 'Humphries RK', 'Karlsson S']","['Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Cd24a protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Gaucher Disease/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Glucosylceramidase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65283-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1754-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some HOX C cluster genes are found to be expressed in lymphoid cells of mice and humans. Their function and expression in normal hematopoiesis are still largely unknown. We have studied the mRNA expression of HOXC4, HOXC5, and HOXC6 in several stages of lymphocyte maturation by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). We examined CD34+/CD38low and CD34+/CD38high cells obtained from normal donor bone marrow (BM), a panel of 19 lymphoid cell lines, several types of leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and lymphocytes isolated from tonsillar tissue and peripheral blood (PB). HOXC4 and HOXC6 were found to be expressed during maturation in B- and T-lymphoid cells. The expression of each gene was found to be initiated at different cell maturation stages. HOXC4 transcripts were present in CD34+/CD38low cells, which are thought to comprise stem cells and noncommitted progenitor cells, and in subsequent stages to terminally maturated lymphoid cells. HOXC6 expression is initiated in equivalents of prothymocyte and pre-pre-B cell stage and remains present in mature cells. However, HOXC5 is only expressed in neoplastic cell lines and in neoplastic cells of NHL, but not in CD34+ BM cells, nor in resting or activated lymphoid cells isolated from tonsil, PB, or in leukemia cells. In cell lines, weak expression of HOXC5 is initiated in equivalents of pre-B cell and common thymocyte stage and is continuously expressed in mature cell lines. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression levels of HOXC5 were much lower than those of HOXC4 and HOXC6; furthermore an increase of expression of HOXC4, HOXC5, and HOXC6 during lymphoid cell differentiation was demonstrated. Thus, mainly mature lymphoid cell lines and neoplastic cells of NHL do express HOXC5, in contrast to the lack of expression in normal lymphoid cells and leukemias. These findings suggest involvement of HOXC5 in lymphomagenesis.","['Bijl, J', 'van Oostveen, J W', 'Kreike, M', 'Rieger, E', 'van der Raaij-Helmer, L M', 'Walboomers, J M', 'Corte, G', 'Boncinelli, E', 'van den Brule, A J', 'Meijer, C J']","['Bijl J', 'van Oostveen JW', 'Kreike M', 'Rieger E', 'van der Raaij-Helmer LM', 'Walboomers JM', 'Corte G', 'Boncinelli E', 'van den Brule AJ', 'Meijer CJ']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HOXC4 protein, human)', '0 (HOXC6 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Child', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65281-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 1;87(5):1737-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been used as a successful salvage and in postremission therapy but not as initial induction treatment. Patients aged 15 to 60 years, presenting with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were randomized to receive either high-dose cytarabine, 3 g/m2 12 hourly on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 for 8 doses, daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 days 1 to 3, etoposide 75 mg/m2 days 1 to 7, (HIDAC-3-7) or standard dose cytarabine 100 mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days with daunorubicin and etoposide at the same dose and schedule as above (7-3-7). Patients could receive a second or third induction course if complete remission (CR) was not achieved. All patients received the same postinduction consolidation therapy (5-2-5) for 2 courses. Eligible patients had no prior chemotherapy or myelodysplastic disease. Patients have been followed for a median of 4.5 years. Of 301 patients treated, complete response (CR) was achieved in 71% with HIDAC-3-7 and 74% with 7-3-7. For patients in CR, the estimated median remission duration was 45 months with HIDAC-3-7 and 12 months with 7-3-7 (P = .0005 univariate analysis, P = .0004 multivariate analysis). The estimated percentage of patients relapse free 5 years after achieving a CR was 49% on HIDAC-3-7 and 24% on 7-3-7. Patients in CR tended to survive longer with HIDAC-3-7 but there were no overall survival differences between the two arms. HIDAC-3-7 was associated with significantly more toxicity in induction with more leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and vomiting and eye toxicity (all P < .001) but a similar incidence of severe central nervous system and cerebellar toxicity compared to 7-3-7. The consolidation treatment was the same in both arms but caused significantly more leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients previously treated with HIDAC-3-7 induction (P < .0001).

In this report, we describe the presence of constitutively activated STAT factors in peripheral blood cells from patients with acute leukemia. We used oligonucleotide probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters and the ISRE probe to detect STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells in bandshift assays. Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters, but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe, when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were investigated. We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation. Specific antibodies directed against the individual STAT proteins were used in supershift experiments. STAT5- and STAT1-related factors were detected in ALL and STAT1-, STAT3-, and STAT5-related proteins were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML. Since the cells were not treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted, we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo.

The modulators verapamil, cyclosporin and trifluoperazine interacted with P-glycoprotein as single molecules, while vinblastine, mefloquine, dipyridamole, tamoxifen and quinidine displayed Hill numbers close to 2, suggesting that pairs of modulator molecules need to act together in order to bring about effective reversal of P-glycoprotein. When the modulators were presented to P-glycoprotein in pairs, we found examples of both competitive and non-competitive behaviour. We interpret these results on a model in which two modulatory sites exit on the MDR pump. To one of these, mefloquine, vinblastine and tamoxifen bind preferentially; to the other, verapamil, dipyridamole, trifluoperazine and quinidine bind (but mefloquine and tamoxifen only weakly if at all).

To examine the basis for the phenotypic expression of c-Fes, the transcription initiation sites of the human c-Fes gene were mapped in myeloid leukemia cells and regulatory elements in the genomic c-Fes sequence were characterized. Two major transcription initiation sites were found in the myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 which delineated exon 1 to be 72-83 bp. When the activity of the CAT reporter gene under the control of the c-Fes promoter region, untranslated exon 1 and intron 1 was measured in TF-1, K562 and MCF-7 cells, only TF-1 cells exhibited chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. In contrast, all cell lines supported reporter gene activity when intron 1 was deleted. Deletion analyses revealed a negative regulatory region in intron 1, which was localized by Southwestern analysis and DNA footprinting to a 14 bp region. This negative regulatory region suppressed reporter CAT activity in K562 and TF-1 cells when inserted downstream to the SV40 early promoter.

In normal blood cells, five size classes (2-8 kb) of AML1 mRNAs have been previously observed. We isolated seven cDNAs corresponding to various AML1 mRNAs. Sequencing revealed that their size differences were mainly due to alternatively spliced 5' and 3' untranslated regions, some of which were vast, exceeding 1.5 kb (5') and 4.3 kb (3'). These untranslated regions contain sequences known to control mRNA translation and stability and seem to modulate AML1 mRNA stability. Further heterogeneity was found in the coding region due to the presence of alternatively spliced stop codon-containing exons. The latter led to production of polypeptides that were smaller than the full-length AML1 protein; they lacked the trans-activation domains but maintained DNA binding and heterodimerization ability. The size of these truncated products was similar to the AML1 segment in the fused t(8;21) and t(3;21) proteins. In thymus, only one mRNA species of 6 kb was detected.

The 6-kb mRNA was also prominent in cultured peripheral blood T cells, and its expression was markedly reduced upon mitogenic activation by phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) plus concanavalin A (ConA).

We compared the frequency of HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections among patients with lymphopholiferative disorders (n=65), individuals with various sexually transmitted diseases (n=40), patients with genitals candidiasis (n=25) and apparently healthy individuals (n=60). Serological analysis of blood samples from all four groups showed that 10 of the 190 (5.3%) individuals tested were confirmed positive for the presence of antibodies to HTLV-I(6) or HTLV-II(4). Using the PCR technique, specific HTLV-I or HTLV-II sequences were amplified from the genomic DNA of 4 of 6 HTLV-I seropositive and 3 of the 4 HTLV-II seropositive individuals respectively. However, sequences of both viruses were amplified from the genomic DNAs of the remaining 3 seropositive individuals. Since one of the 5 sets of primer pairs [SK110(II)/SK111(II)], which is used for specific identification of HTLV-II did not amplify the target sequence from the genomic DNAs of any of the 4 HTLV-II confirmed seropositive individuals in this study, it suggested sequence diversity of these viruses in Nigeria. The virus-infected individuals identified in this study were one (1.5%) of the 65 patients with leukaemia/lymphoma (HTLV-I), 6 of 40 (15.0%) individuals (HTLV-I = 1 , HTLV-II = 3, HTLV-I/II = 2) with sexually transmitted diseases (STD), one of 25(4.0%) subjects with genital candidiasis for HTLV-I and 2 of 60 (33.3%) healthy individuals (one for HTLV-I and one for HTLV-I/II). There was a significant difference (P < 0.025) between the prevalence of HTLV-I/II infections among patients with lymphoma/leukaemia and those who attended STD clinic in Ibadan, Nigeria.

METHODS: Between 1983 and 1994, 20 children underwent intracardiac repair of Taussig-Bing anomaly. Mean age at operation was 17 months (range, 1 week to 9 years). Prior palliation included pulmonary artery band (15) with coarctation repair (8) and atrial septectomy (1). Arterial switch with VSD closure was performed in 16 patients, 10 with anteroposterior great arteries. Kawashima repair was performed in 4 patients, all with side-by-side great arteries. RESULTS: After arterial switch, there was one operative death (6.2%) due to myocardial ischemia and three late deaths (18.7%) due to pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. In the Kawashima repair group there have been no deaths. After arterial switch, 9 patients underwent 11 reoperations for residual coarctation (3), residual pulmonary artery stenosis (2), aortic valve replacement, aortic valvuloplasty, unrecognized VSD, mitral valvuloplasty, mediastinitis, and pacemaker insertion. After Kawashima repair, 1 patient underwent reoperation for baffle stenosis and 1 for an unrecognized VSD. CONCLUSIONS: For children with Taussig-Bing anomaly, the Kawashima intraventricular repair (for side-by-side great arteries) preserves the native aortic valve and avoids coronary dissection. The arterial switch operation with VSD closure can be applied without ventriculotomy to all great artery relationships and allows neonatal repair with or without concomitant coarctation repair. Both techniques yield excellent early and intermediate-term results despite the high rates of prerepair palliation and postrepair reoperation for both groups.","['Mavroudis, C', 'Backer, C L', 'Muster, A J', 'Rocchini, A P', 'Rees, A H', 'Gevitz, M']","['Mavroudis C', 'Backer CL', 'Muster AJ', 'Rocchini AP', 'Rees AH', 'Gevitz M']","[""Division of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgery, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL 60614, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,,IM,"['Aortic Coarctation/surgery', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double Outlet Right Ventricle/*surgery', 'Female', 'Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pulmonary Artery/surgery']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-4975(96)00079-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-4975(96)00079-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 1996 May;61(5):1330-8. doi: 10.1016/0003-4975(96)00079-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor regression occurred when virus was injected either within 24 hr of tumor cell implantation or with established tumors. However, regression of the tumor was also observed in controls in which either the wild-type virus or a recombinant virus containing the luciferase gene was used, although tumor growth was not completely suppressed. Tumor regression was accompanied by a decrease in p53 expression. Two other tumors, the human myelogenous leukemic cell line K562 and the hamster melanoma tumor RPMI 1846, also responded to treatment but only with ad5/IFN. In the case of K562 tumors, there was complete regression of the tumor, and tumors derived from RPMI 1846 showed partial regression. We propose that the complete regression of the breast cancer with the recombinant virus ad5/IFN was the result of two events: viral oncolysis in which tumor cells are being selectively lysed by the replication-competent virus and the enhanced effect of expression of the IFN-con1 gene. K562 and RPMI 1846 tumors regressed only as a result of IFN gene therapy. This was confirmed by in vitro analysis. Our results indicate that a combination of viral oncolysis with a virus of low pathogenicity, itself resistant to the effects of IFN and IFN gene therapy, might be a fruitful approach to the treatment of a variety of different tumors, in particular breast cancers.","['Zhang, J F', 'Hu, C', 'Geng, Y', 'Selm, J', 'Klein, S B', 'Orazi, A', 'Taylor, M W']","['Zhang JF', 'Hu C', 'Geng Y', 'Selm J', 'Klein SB', 'Orazi A', 'Taylor MW']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Melanoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",1996/04/30 00:00,1996/04/30 00:01,['1996/04/30 00:00'],"['1996/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.9.4513 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 30;93(9):4513-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.9.4513.,,,,,PMC39570,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that HIV-2 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 at the molecular level. This inhibition was selective, dose-dependent, and nonreciprocal. The closely related simian immunodeficiency provirus also inhibited HIV-1. The selectivity of inhibition was shown by the observation that HIV-2 did not significantly downmodulate the expression of the unrelated murine leukemia virus; neither did the murine leukemia virus markedly affect HIV-1 or HIV-2 expression. Moreover, while HIV-2 potently inhibited HIV-1, the reverse did not happen, thus identifying yet another and remarkable difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2. Mutational analysis of the HIV-2 genome suggested that the inhibition follows a complex pathway, possibly involving multiple genes and redundant mechanisms. Introduction of inactivating mutations into the structural and regulatory/accessory genes did not render the HIV-2 provirus ineffective. Some of the HIV-2 gene defects, such as that of tat and rev genes, were phenotypically transcomplemented by HIV-1. The HIV-2 proviruses with deletions in the putative packaging signal and defective for virus replication were effective in inducing the suppressive phenotype. Though the exact mechanism remains to be defined, the inhibition appeared to be mainly due to an intracellular molecular event because it could not be explained solely on the basis of cell surface receptor mediated interference. The results support the notion that the inhibition likely occurred at the level of viral RNA, possibly involving competition between viral RNAs for some transcriptional factor essential for virus replication. Induction of a cytokine is another possibility. These findings might be relevant to the clinical-epidemiological data suggesting that infection with HIV-2 may offer some protection against HIV-1 infection.","['Arya, S K', 'Gallo, R C']","['Arya SK', 'Gallo RC']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*therapy', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, rev', 'Genes, tat', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Mice', 'Proviruses/physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1996/04/30 00:00,1996/04/30 00:01,['1996/04/30 00:00'],"['1996/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.9.4486 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 30;93(9):4486-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.9.4486.,,,,,PMC39565,,,,,,,,,,,,

We replaced the env gene of a Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived provirus by a foreign gene, generating a plasmid that upon transfer to tumor cells generates noninfectious retroviral particles carrying the transgene. We added to this plasmid an independent expression cassette comprising a cytomegalovirus promoter, an amphotropic retroviral envelope, and a polyadenylylation signal from simian virus 40. These constructs were designed to minimize the risk of recombination generating replication-competent retroviruses. Their only region of homology is a 157-bp sequence with 53% identity. We show that the sole transfection of this plasmid in various cell lines generates infectious but defective retroviral particles capable of efficiently infecting and expressing the transgene. The formation of infectious particles allows the transgene propagation in vitro. Eight days after transfection in vitro, the proportion of cells expressing the transgene is increased by 10-60 times. There was no evidence of replication-competent retrovirus generation in these experiments. The intratumoral injection of this plasmid, but not of the control vector lacking the env gene, led to foci of transgene-expressing cells, suggesting that the transgene had propagated in situ.

Recently, a large number of cytokines and growth factors have been shown to activate the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. In the case of IL-6 and LIF, which share a signal transducing receptor gp130, STAT3 is specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by stimulation with each cytokine in various cell types. To know the role of JAK-STAT pathway in M1 differentiation, we have constructed dominant negative forms of STAT3 and established M1 cell lines that constitutively express them. These M1 cells that overexpressed dominant negative forms showed no induction of differentiation-associated markers including Fc gamma receptors, ferritin light chain, and lysozyme after treatment with IL-6. Expression of either c-myb or c-myc was not downregulated. Furthermore, IL-6- and LIF-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis were completely blocked. Thus these findings demonstrate that STAT3 activation is the critical step in a cascade of events that leads to terminal differentiation of M1 cells.","['Minami, M', 'Inoue, M', 'Wei, S', 'Takeda, K', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Akira, S']","['Minami M', 'Inoue M', 'Wei S', 'Takeda K', 'Matsumoto M', 'Kishimoto T', 'Akira S']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/30 00:00,1996/04/30 00:01,['1996/04/30 00:00'],"['1996/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.9.3963 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 30;93(9):3963-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.9.3963.,,,,,PMC39468,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a global analytical method, we performed a differential display of mRNA between mouse M1 myeloid leukemia cells and derived clone LTR6 cells, which contain a stably transfected temperature-sensitive mutant of p53. At 32 degrees C wild-type p53 function is activated in LTR6 cells, resulting in programmed cell death. Eight genes are activated (TSAP; tumor suppressor activated pathway), and two are inhibited (TSIP, tumor suppressor inhibited pathway) in their expression. None of the 10 sequences has hitherto been recognized as part of the p53 signaling pathway. Three TSAPs are homologous to known genes. TSAP1 corresponds to phospholipase C beta 4. TSAP2 has a conserved domain homologous to a multiple endocrine neoplasia I (ZFM1) candidate gene. TSAP3 is the mouse homologue of the Drosophila seven in absentia gene. These data provide novel molecules involved in the pathway of wild-type p53 activation. They establish a functional link between a homologue of a conserved developmental Drosophila gene and signal transduction in tumor suppression leading to programmed cell death.","['Amson, R B', 'Nemani, M', 'Roperch, J P', 'Israeli, D', 'Bougueleret, L', 'Le Gall, I', 'Medhioub, M', 'Linares-Cruz, G', 'Lethrosne, F', 'Pasturaud, P', 'Piouffre, L', 'Prieur, S', 'Susini, L', 'Alvaro, V', 'Millasseau, P', 'Guidicelli, C', 'Bui, H', 'Massart, C', 'Cazes, L', 'Dufour, F', 'Bruzzoni-Giovanelli, H', 'Owadi, H', 'Hennion, C', 'Charpak, G', 'Telerman, A']","['Amson RB', 'Nemani M', 'Roperch JP', 'Israeli D', 'Bougueleret L', 'Le Gall I', 'Medhioub M', 'Linares-Cruz G', 'Lethrosne F', 'Pasturaud P', 'Piouffre L', 'Prieur S', 'Susini L', 'Alvaro V', 'Millasseau P', 'Guidicelli C', 'Bui H', 'Massart C', 'Cazes L', 'Dufour F', 'Bruzzoni-Giovanelli H', 'Owadi H', 'Hennion C', 'Charpak G', 'Telerman A', 'et al.']","[""Fondation Jean Dausset-Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (Human Polymorphism Study Center), Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (seven in absentia proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Genes, Insect', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Vertebrates']",1996/04/30 00:00,1996/04/30 00:01,['1996/04/30 00:00'],"['1996/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.9.3953 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 30;93(9):3953-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.9.3953.,,,,,PMC39466,,"['GENBANK/U50953', 'GENBANK/U50954', 'GENBANK/U50955', 'GENBANK/U50956', 'GENBANK/U50957', 'GENBANK/U50958', 'GENBANK/U50959', 'GENBANK/U50960', 'GENBANK/U50961', 'GENBANK/U50962']",,,,,,,,,,

One novel tyrosine kinase gene, designated Tnk1, was cloned. The sequence of the complete Tnk1 coding region predicts a 72 kD protein. Comparison of Tnk1 to available sequences in protein databases reveals that it is most homologous to Ack, an intracellular tyrosine kinase which associates with the GTP-bound form of p21cdc42Hs. Like Ack, Tnk1 consists of an N-terminal kinase domain, a putative SH3 domain immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain, and a proline-rich C-terminal region. Analysis of Tnk1 mRNA expression demonstrates that Tnk1 is expressed in all cord blood, bone marrow and adult blood sub-populations, as well as in most of the leukemia cell lines examined (16 of 20). Hybridization to fetal multi-tissue Northern blots detected several different Tnk1 transcripts in all fetal tissues examined. In contrast, a single Tnk1 transcript was detected in only five of 16 adult tissues examined (prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine and colon). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of metaphase chromosomes localized the Tnk1 gene to the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1), near the p53 locus. Thus, Tnk1 is a novel tyrosine kinase that may be involved in signalling pathways utilized broadly during fetal development, more selectively in adult tissues and in cell of the lymphohematopoietic system.","['Hoehn, G T', 'Stokland, T', 'Amin, S', 'Ramirez, M', 'Hawkins, A L', 'Griffin, C A', 'Small, D', 'Civin, C I']","['Hoehn GT', 'Stokland T', 'Amin S', 'Ramirez M', 'Hawkins AL', 'Griffin CA', 'Small D', 'Civin CI']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21287-5001, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fetal Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/blood', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 15;12(4):903-13.,,,,"['NIH CA60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIHCA-06973/HC/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['GENBANK/U43408'],,,,,,,,,,

From the AML1 gene, two representative forms of proteins, AML1a and AML1b, are generated by alternative splicing. Both forms have the runt homology domain that possesses the DNA-binding ability but, unlike AML1b, AML1a lacks a putative transcriptional activation domain downstream of the runt homology domain. By using retroviral infection, we demonstrated that AML1b causes neoplastic transformation of NIH3T3 cells. AML1b-expressing cells form macroscopic colonies in soft agar and induce tumors in nude mice, indicating that AML1 can be a transforming gene when overexpressed in fibroblasts. Both the runt homology domain and the transactivational domain were required to transform NIH3T3 cells. By analysis of deletion mutants, it was shown that an element determining the transactivational potency exists between amino acids 288 and 396 within the region downstream of the runt homology domain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this region was also required for fibroblast transformation, indicating that the transforming activity of AML1 is correlated with the transactivational potencies.

When introduced into factor dependent hematopoietic cell lines, BCR/ABL induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins. One prominent BCR/ABL substrate is p120CBL, the cellular homolog of the v-Cbl oncoprotein. In an effort to understand the possible contribution of p120CBL to transformation by BCR/ABL, we looked for cellular proteins which associate with p120CBL in hematopoietic cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL. In addition to p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL, p120CBL coprecipitated with an 85 kDa phosphoprotein, which was identified as the p85 subunit of PI3K. Anti-p120CBL immunoprecipitates from BCR/ABL-transformed, but not from untransformed, cell lines contained PI3K lipid kinase activity. Interestingly, the adaptor proteins CRKL and c-CRK were also found in these complexes. In vitro binding studies indicated that the SH2 domains of CRKL and c-CRK bound directly to p120CBL, while the SH3 domains of c-CRK and CRKL bound to BCR/ABL and c-ABL. The N-terminal and the C-terminal SH2 and the SH3 domain of p85PI3K bound directly in vitro to p120CBL. The ABL-SH2, but not ABL-SH3, could also bind to p120CBL. These data suggest that BCR/ABL may induce the formation of multimeric complexes of signaling proteins which include p120CBL, PI3K, c-CRK or CRKL, c-ABL and BCR/ABL itself.","['Sattler, M', 'Salgia, R', 'Okuda, K', 'Uemura, N', 'Durstin, M A', 'Pisick, E', 'Xu, G', 'Li, J L', 'Prasad, K V', 'Griffin, J D']","['Sattler M', 'Salgia R', 'Okuda K', 'Uemura N', 'Durstin MA', 'Pisick E', 'Xu G', 'Li JL', 'Prasad KV', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 15;12(4):839-46.,,,,"['CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth of HL-60 cells and MOLT-4 cells was strongly suppressed in the presence of the glycoside; the IC50s of which were 21.0 and 18.0 nM, respectively. Suppressive effect of the glycoside on HL-60 cell growth appears to be mediated partially through induction of apoptosis which was demonstrated by the presence of DNA fragmentation of the leukemic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of glycoside-treated HL-60 cells also demonstrated apoptotic cells with low DNA content and showed a decrease of G0/G1 cells and a concomitant increase of S and/or G2M cells. The growth inhibiting effect of the glycoside on HL-60 cells was promoted by calcium and was inhibited in the presence of zinc, which support involvement of endonuclease activation in the glycoside-induced apoptosis.

In order to investigate this defect at the molecular level and, in turn, the discordant maturation of these granulocytes, we compared the expression of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII, the two receptors for IgG on the surface of granulocytes, in normal and CML samples. Our flow cytometric data show that the number of granulocytes expressing Fc gamma RIII is lowered in CML patients to near half that in normal individuals, with a simultaneous decrease in the steady-state levels of the mRNA for Fc gamma RIII. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), an indicator of the number of receptors per cell, varies widely for Fc gamma RIII in normal individuals whereas it is more localized and lowered in granulocytes from CML patients. The number of granulocytes positive for Fc gamma RII is also significantly lowered in CML samples compared to the normals, which exhibit a wide variation in the number of cells positive for the receptor, even though their nRNA levels do not vary much. The CML granulocytes, in general, exhibit lowered levels of the steady-state mRNA for Fc gamma RII. The MFI for the surface expression of Fc gamma RII is only marginally different between the two cell types. Our data indicate that the morphologically homogeneous population of CML granulocytes actually consists of at least two types of cells, one which expresses the Fc receptors and one which does not.","['Kant, A', 'Advani, S', 'Zingde, S']","['Kant A', 'Advani S', 'Zingde S']","['Cancer Research Institute, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/*analysis/genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695001263 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00126-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jan;20(1):93-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00126-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 1-dependent AML blast functions were inhibited during in vitro culture either by IL1-specific neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL1 alpha and anti-IL1 beta) or by the IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA). Endogenous IL1 secretion showed a wide variation between individual patients, but despite this variation IL1 inhibition significantly decreased both spontaneous blast proliferation and spontaneous blast secretion of IL1 alpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6. In contrast to spontaneous blast proliferation, in the presence of exogenous hematopoietic growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, tumor necrosis factor alpha, stem cell factor), IL1 inhibition caused either increased or decreased AML blast proliferation depending on the individual patient. When AML blasts were cultured with stem cell factor plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL1 inhibition significantly increased AML blast proliferation. Thus, IL1 is important for regulation of AML blast proliferation and cytokine secretion independent of the level of endogenous IL1 secretion, but the final effect of IL1 is highly dependent on the cytokine network in the AML blast microenvironment.","['Bruserud, O']",['Bruserud O'],"['Medical Department B, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialoglycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695001123 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00112-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jan;20(1):65-73. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00112-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linomide, at 0.02-0.3 mg/ml, augmented IL-2-induced proliferation of LGLs and NK cells in an inversely proportional manner. In contrast, Linomide at 0.6-4.8 mg/ml inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation of LGLs and NK cells in a dose-dependent manner. Linomide was able to potentiate phytohemaglutinin-induced CD3(+) cell proliferation. In addition, supernatants derived from Linomide treated CD3(+) T cells were able to mimic the direct stimulatory effect of Linomide on activated NK cell proliferation. These supernatants were found to have low levels of tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) and therefore Linomide stimulation of NK and T cell proliferation may be due to its inhibitory effect on the secretion of these cytokines by activated CD3(+) T cells. Linomide had no effect on cytotoxicity nor on the phenotypic expression of resting and IL-2-activated LGLs or NK cells.

The leukemic blasts were exposed to either drug at equimolar concentrations (10 microM) for 3 h and further incubated with Ara-C (5 microM), added immediately (day 0) or after an interval of 24 h in cells were kept in a drug free medium (day 1). On day 0, leukemic cells exposed to fludarabine 10 microM had a significant (P<0.01) increase in Ara-C uptake (297 +/- 11 pmol/10(7) cells) with respect to control cells (not pre-treated: 195 +/- 10 pmol/10 (7) cells). After treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine, cytoplasmic Ara-C peaked after 180 min of exposure, as well as nuclear bound Ara-C. At the same time, a significant decrease in the number of S-phase leukemic cells, consistent with depressed [3 H]TdR uptake was observed. Although on day 0 gemcitabine 10 microM did not have potentiating effects on Ara-C uptake, it showed a high degree of intrinsic cytotoxicity as a single agent(clear from cell cycle distribution, [3H]TdR uptake, plating efficiency (PE) data and percentage of apoptotic cells). Cells exposed to gemcitabine, on the other hand, showed on day 1 a significant increase in Ara-C uptake (2.4 x control values in the cytoplasmic and 3x in the nuclear fractions) and a reduced number of S-phase blasts, [3H]TdR uptake and PEs, as well as an increased apoptotic cell death. Evidently, it is possible to modulate Ara-C uptake by leukemic cells with gemcitabine. Although this effect is similar to that demonstrated with fludarabine, its kinetics and time of efficacy are different and also, because of its intrinsic higher cytoxicity and lack of important side effects, gemcitabine could be considered a suitable candidate for Ara-C association therapy in acute leukemia.","['Santini, V', ""D'Ippolito, G"", 'Bernabei, P A', 'Zoccolante, A', 'Ermini, A', 'Rossi-Ferrini, P']","['Santini V', ""D'Ippolito G"", 'Bernabei PA', 'Zoccolante A', 'Ermini A', 'Rossi-Ferrini P']","['Divisione e Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695001069 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00106-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jan;20(1):37-45. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00106-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rhG-CSF stimulated leukemic colony formation of the promyelocytic leukemic cell line L-8801 in methylcellulose culture and increased the number of L-8801 cells in liquid culture. However, rhG-CSF treatment prolonged the median survival period of mice implanted with L-8801 cells and the emergence of the leukemic blast cells in peripheral blood. Meanwhile, rhG-CSF had no influence on that of the megakaryoblastic leukemic cells L-8057 and failed to prolong the median survival period of L-8057 leukemic mice. Receptor binding analysis revealed that L-8801 cells expressed a G-CSF receptor (Kd=125 pM, 479 binding sites/cell) and L-8057 cells had no G-CSF receptors. Then, we examined the growth potential of these cells. The median survival period was longer for mice implanted with L-8801 cells cultured with rhG-CSF for 72 h in vitro than for cells grown without rhG-CSF. Furthermore, the median survival period of mice implanted with spleen cells from L-8801 leukemic mice treated with rhG-CSF was prolonged compared with those from leukemic mice without rhG-CSF.

When S-D-lactoylglutathione was added to human leukaemia 60 cells in culture, it was hydrolysed by thiolesterase activity to reduced glutathione and D-lactate but also converted to N-D-lactoylcysteinylglycine and N-D-lactoylcysteine by gamma-glutamyl transferase and dipeptidase. The N-D-lactoylcysteine inhibited human leukaemia 60 cell growth: the median growth inhibitory concentration IC(50) value was 46.7 +/ -0.9 (N=30) and the median toxic concentration TC(50) value was 103 +/- 1 microM.

These serious complications have been attributed by some authors to the release of tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity (PCA), particularly during cytotoxic chemotherapy. In previous studies of normal peripheral blood cells, only cells of the monocyte lineage have been found to express TF PCA. Therefore, several questions remain regarding the origin and characterization of the PCA in malignant leukemic cells, particularly those thought to be derived from granulocyte progenitor cells. We utilized a full-length cDNA probe, several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and a sensitive one-stage PCA assay to study the expression of TF in the human cell line, HL-60, in human peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mo) and in highly purified populations of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In the HL-60 cells we detected low but significant levels of TF mRNA and TF antigen (TF:Ag). In unstimulated cells, coordinate increased levels of TF mRNA, TF:Ag and TF PCA expression were noted following phorbol-ester-induced macrophage differentiation of the cells, but a decreased level of TF mRNA with no change in the basal level of TF:Ag expression occurred following retinoic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation of this cell line. Long-term cultures of stimulated mature Mo/Mo demonstrated initial coordinate expression of TF mRNA, TF:Ag and TF PCA, but TF:Ag expression persisted even after 7 days (when TF PCA was undetectable). No TF PCA, TF:Ag or TF mRNA was demonstrated in highly purified populations of human PMN, regardless of culture conditions. Discordant expression of TF mRNA, TF:Ag and TF PCA in HL-60 cells suggests the possibility of novel, post-synthetic mechanisms for the regulation of TF PCA expression, which might be dependent on the phenotypic differentiation level of the cell. Such mechanisms (yet to be defined) might account for the ability of some leukemic cells, which frequently express characteristics of more than one cell line (e.g. monocytes and granulocytes), to express a TF gene product capable of activating blood coagulation.","['Hair, G A', 'Padula, S', 'Zeff, R', 'Schmeizl, M', 'Contrino, J', 'Kreutzer, D L', 'de Moerloose, P', 'Boyd, A W', 'Stanley, I', 'Burgess, A W', 'Rickles, F R']","['Hair GA', 'Padula S', 'Zeff R', 'Schmeizl M', 'Contrino J', 'Kreutzer DL', 'de Moerloose P', 'Boyd AW', 'Stanley I', 'Burgess AW', 'Rickles FR']","['The University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695001077 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00107-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jan;20(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00107-7.,['Leuk Res. 1996 Jan;20(1):13-6.

We have recently found that the pleioclonal-->monoclonal transition may occur early during the PL latency and long before the eruption of a full blown lymphoma. We sought to find out what causes one PL clone to become dominant. Our working hypothesis was that a dominant clone(s) at the PL stage has the ability to inhibit the development of other, recessive clones. Since some premalignant characteristics of a progenitor clone are probably maintained in the descending lymphoma, we studied whether tumors that developed after injection of a high dose (HD) of PL cells were dominant over tumors that developed after injection of a limiting dose (LD) of PL cells. To identify dominant clones, HD and LD lymphomas were mixed in a co-culture and the outgrowth of one clone over the other was determined by T beta-TCR rearrangement analysis. A checker-board combination of seven lymphomas revealed a dominance hierarchy scale. Lymphomas induced directly by the virus (without transfer) were dominant over both HD and LD lymphomas. High dose lymphomas were dominant over LD lymphomas and LD lymphomas were always recessive. The speed at which a dominant lymphoma outgrew the co-culture suggested that dominance is acquired through the ability of the prevailing cells to actively suppress the growth of recessive cells.","['Avni, O', 'Yefenof, E', 'Kotler, M']","['Avni O', 'Yefenof E', 'Kotler M']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/pathology', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*pathology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695000798 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00079-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Dec;19(12):971-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00079-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting chimeric BCR-ABL oncoproteins are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

In this paper, we localize the alternative exons to a 4.1 kb BglII fragment in the 5' region of the large first intron of the BCR gene. This genomic structure is of interest because of its analogy to the organization of the ABL gene and because this part of the gene is not affected by the breakpoints occurring in Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

The present study aimed at investigating comparable phenomena induced by high doses of gamma-irradiation in the presence of physiological factors. The erythroleukemic K562 cells were gamma-irradiated or treated with cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C), and examined for cell size, protein content, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-activity and hemoglobin synthesis in relation to mitotic activity. At doses above 10 Gy, differentiation was induced, as recognized by elevated AChE-activity, accompanied by an increase in cell size and protein content and cessation of cell proliferation. Moreover, irradiation, as well as Ara-C, induced hemoglobin synthesis when cultures were supplemented with hemin prior to treatment. It is suggested that the basic mechanisms of differentiation induction are similar for ionizing radiation and certain chemical agents and are related to continued growth of essential cytoplasmic constituents during inhibition of mitotic activity.","['Schwenke, K', 'Peterson, H P', 'Wangenheim, K H', 'Feinendegen, L E']","['Schwenke K', 'Peterson HP', 'Wangenheim KH', 'Feinendegen LE']","['Institute of Medicine, Research Center Julich GmbH, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695000968 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00096-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Dec;19(12):955-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00096-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a fraction, designated as fraction A, obtained from human plasma extract that inhibits the growth of several human-derived leukemia cell lines. The effect of the fraction was retained after protease digestion or heat treatment. Murine leukemia cells and ouabain-resistant cells, which are insensitive to bufalin, appeared to be refractory to fraction A in terms of growth inhibition. Fraction A also induced functional and morphological maturation in THP-1 cells. Fraction A was recognized by anti-bufalin anti-serum and inhibited 3H-bufalin binding to K562 cells.

A total of 31 novel lipophilic TS inhibitors, lacking a glutamate residue, were synthesized; 26 of them had in common a N-((3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-6-quinazolinyl)methyl)-N-prop-2-ynylaniline+ ++ structure in which the aniline was appropriately substituted with simple lipophilic substituents either in position 3 or 4, or in both. Compounds were tested for their inhibition of E. coli TS and human TS and also for their inhibition of the growth in tissue culture of a murine leukemia, a human leukemia, and a thymidine kinase-deficient human adenocarcinoma. The crystal structures of five inhibitors complexed with E. coli TS were determined. Five main conclusions are drawn from this study. (i) A 3-substituent such as CF(3), iodo, or ethynyl enhances binding by up to 1 order of magnitude and in the case of CF(3) was proven to fill a nearby pocket in the enzyme. (ii) A simple strongly electron-withdrawing substituent such as NO(2) or CF(3)SO(2) in the 4-position enhances binding by 2 orders of magnitude; it is hypothesized that the transannular dipole so induced interacts favorably with the protein. (iii) Attempts to combine the enhancements of i and ii in the same molecule were generally unsuccessful (iv) A 4-C(6)H(5)SO(2) substituent provided both electron withdrawal and a van der Waal's interaction of the phenyl group with a hydrophobic surface at the mouth of the active site. The inhibition (K(is) = 12 nM) of human TS by this compound, 7n, showed that C(6)H(5)SO(2) provided virtually as much binding affinity as the CO-glutamate which it had replaced.

To determine optimal therapy for pediatric oncology patients with pericardial effusion and tamponade, the authors reviewed their institutional experience with percutaneous catheter drainage. METHODS: Patient records and operative reports were reviewed, and nine patients were identified who met clinical and echocardiographic criteria of cardiac tamponade and were treated with percutaneous pericardial catheter drainage. RESULTS: The median age at time of diagnosis was 14 years (range, 5 months to 19 years), and the male:female ratio was 7:3. Underlying malignancies included acute myeloblastic leukemia in three, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in one, and Hodgkin's disease, B-cell lymphoma, medulloblastoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma in one each. EIght patients (89%) were receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) during the period when tamponade developed. All patients had a large or moderate-to-large pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse with hemodynamic compromise on echocardiography, and two patients (22%) also had pericardial thickening. In nine patients, percutaneous catheter drainage was performed intraoperatively and under fluoroscopic or echocardiographic guidance. A median of 300 mL (range, 82 to 500 mL) of fluid was removed from the pericardial sac during the initial drainage, and cytology was positive in one (6%). Complete echocardiographic resolution was observed in eight patients (89%); a small posterior component persisted in one patient but was not significant hemodynamically. The catheters remained in place for a median of 5 days (range, 1 to 35 days) while repeat aspirations were performed. Tamponade resolved in all patients, and one died of overwhelming systemic sepsis. The survival period was 10 to 22 months, and tamponade or the drainage procedure did not contribute to death. Four patients remain alive after 4 month to 7 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cardiac tamponade was effectively treated in all patients and did not recur with percutaneous catheter drainage alone. THere was no evidence of pericardial loculation or infection despite pancytopenia being prevalent with underlying illness and chemotherapy. Percutaneous catheter drainage is an effective treatment for pediatric oncology patients with pericardial tamponade. Because of its simplicity in comparison to move invasive techniques, initial treatment with percutaneous drainage should be considered in this patient population.","['Medary, I', 'Steinherz, L J', 'Aronson, D C', 'La Quaglia, M P']","['Medary I', 'Steinherz LJ', 'Aronson DC', 'La Quaglia MP']","['Department of Surgery (Pediatric Surgery), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cardiac Tamponade/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*therapy', 'Catheterization/methods', 'Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drainage/instrumentation/*methods', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pericardial Effusion/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(96)90347-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(96)90347-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1996 Jan;31(1):197-9; discussion 199-200. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(96)90347-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(TH) activity and a 75% increase in choline acetyltransferase activity. This LIF treatment paradigm decreased BH4 levels in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal decline of 60% observed at 1 ng/ml. Analysis of the time course of this response indicated that LIF decreased BH4 levels by 60% following 3-7 days of treatment. Treatment of cultures with CNTF (2 ng/ml) resulted in a decline in BH4 levels that was of equal magnitude and followed the same time course as that produced by LIF. The LIF-dependent decline in BH4 levels resulted from a reduction in GTPCH enzyme activity, which decreased by 75% following 7 days of treatment. Nuclease protection assays of RNA extracted from cells treated for 7 days with 2 ng/ml of LIF or CNTF detected a 78-96% reduction in GTPCH mRNA content relative to beta-actin mRNA content. Concomitant decreases in TH and GTPCH gene expression in response to LIF or CNTF demonstrate a coordinated regulation of gene expression for this BH4-dependent enzyme and the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of its essential cofactor, BH4. Moreover, these results indicate that GTPCH gene expression in SCG neurons should be regarded as a trait of the noradrenergic phenotype.","['Stegenga, S L', 'Hirayama, K', 'Kapatos, G']","['Stegenga SL', 'Hirayama K', 'Kapatos G']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)']",IM,"['Adrenergic Fibers/chemistry/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*analysis', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured/chemistry/enzymology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/chemistry/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology', 'Time Factors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66062541.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1996 Jun;66(6):2541-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66062541.x.,,,,['NS26081/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A biochemical and morphometric study.,3523-33,"Biochemical and morphometric approaches were combined to examine whether constitutive secretory transport might be controlled by plasma membrane receptors, as this possibility would have significant physiological implications. Indeed, IgE receptor stimulation in rat basophilic leukemia cells potently increased the rate of transport of soluble pulse-labeled 35S-sulfated glycosaminoglycans from distal Golgi compartments to the cell surface. This effect was largely protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent. Direct activation of PKC also stimulated constitutive transport of glycosaminoglycans, as indicated by the use of agonistic and antagonistic PKC ligands. PKC ligands also had potent, but different, effects on the exocytic transport from distal Golgi compartments to the plasma membrane of a membrane-bound protein (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein), which was slightly stimulated by activators and profoundly suppressed by inhibitors of PKC. Morphological analysis showed impressive changes of the organelles of the secretory pathway in response to IgE receptor stimulation and to direct PKC activation (enhanced number of buds and vesicles originating from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and increase in surface and volume of Golgi compartments), suggestive of an overall activation of exocytic movements. These results show that rapid and large changes in constitutive transport fluxes and in the morphology of the exocytic apparatus can be induced by membrane receptors (as well as by direct PKC stimulation).","['Buccione, R', 'Bannykh, S', 'Santone, I', 'Baldassarre, M', 'Facchiano, F', 'Bozzi, Y', 'Di Tullio, G', 'Mironov, A', 'Luini, A', 'De Matteis, M A']","['Buccione R', 'Bannykh S', 'Santone I', 'Baldassarre M', 'Facchiano F', 'Bozzi Y', 'Di Tullio G', 'Mironov A', 'Luini A', 'De Matteis MA']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and the Physiopathology of Secretion Unit, 66030 S.

While these results suggest that alterations in Spi-1 expression have significant effects on erythroblast growth and differentiation, neither the cause nor the effect of the decrease in Spi-1 expression that follows Me2SO exposure has been established. The experiments described here demonstrate that the effect of inducers on Spi-1 expression is regulated post-transcriptionally. Nuclear run-off transcriptions demonstrated that Spi-1 transcription was not decreased following Me2SO exposure. Additionally, expression of a recombinant Spi-1 mRNA under transcriptional control of a constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter was regulated identically to endogenous Spi-1 mRNA. The ability of Me2SO to destabilize Spi-1 mRNA was selective, as the stability of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 were not similarly effected. The effect of Me2SO on the stability of Spi-1 mRNA provides a novel means of altering gene expression in these cells and is likely to have significance for the differentiation of these cells.","['Hensold, J O', 'Stratton, C A', 'Barth, D', 'Galson, D L']","['Hensold JO', 'Stratton CA', 'Barth D', 'Galson DL']","['University/Ireland Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1996/02/16 00:00,1996/02/16 00:01,['1996/02/16 00:00'],"['1996/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.7.3385 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45870-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Feb 16;271(7):3385-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.7.3385.,,,,['DK43414/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that parathyroid hormone induces expression by osteoblasts of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor without affecting the 16 other cytokines that were examined. We also showed that stimulation of osteoclast activity by parathyroid hormone is dependent on activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway and secretion of interleukin-6 by osteoblasts. In the current study, we demonstrate that the rapid and transient stimulation of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor is inhibited by actinomycin D and superinduced by protein synthesis inhibitors, the classical characteristics of an immediate-early gene response. Moreover, activation of cAMP signal transduction by parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein is necessary and sufficient to induce both interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. In addition, cAMP analogues as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide and isoproterenol, two neuropeptides that stimulate bone resorption by activating cAMP signal transduction in osteoblasts, also induce interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor in these cells. Taken together with our previous results, this study suggests that interleukin-6 is crucial for stimulation of bone resorption not only by parathyroid hormone, but also by parathyroid hormone-related protein, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and beta-adrenergic agonists, like isoproterenol.","['Greenfield, E M', 'Horowitz, M C', 'Lavish, S A']","['Greenfield EM', 'Horowitz MC', 'Lavish SA']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-5000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Osteoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/pharmacology']",1996/05/03 00:00,1996/05/03 00:01,['1996/05/03 00:00'],"['1996/05/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.18.10984 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)98105-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 3;271(18):10984-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.18.10984.,,,,"['AR40073/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR40507/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR41674/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both genes were constitutively transcribed in peripheral blood lymphocytes. By using specific antisera, we demonstrated that both Stat5A and Stat5B are activated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) in peripheral blood lymphocytes, natural killer-like YT leukemia cells, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I-transformed MT-2 T cells. In COS-7 cells, which constitutively express the Janus family tyrosine kinase Jak1, reconstitution of IL-2-induced Stat5A and Stat5B DNA binding activities was dependent on the coexpression of Jak3 along with the IL-2 receptor beta chain and the common cytokine receptor gamma-chain. This IL-2-induced Stat5 activation was dependent on the presence of either of two tyrosines (Tyr-392 or Tyr-510) in the IL-2 receptor beta chain, indicating that either of these two tyrosines can serve as a docking site. Moreover, we demonstrated that human Stat5 activation is also dependent on Tyr-694 in Stat5A and Tyr-699 in Stat5B, indicating that these tyrosines are required for dimerization.

Its expression is restricted to a few cell types, including monocyte/macrophages. In these cells, CD36 is involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and foam cell formation by uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein. To study the molecular mechanisms that control the transcription of the CD36 gene in monocytic cells we have isolated and analyzed the CD36 promoter. Transient expression experiments of 5'-deletion fragments of the CD36 promoter coupled to luciferase demonstrated that as few as 158 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct the monocyte-specific transcription of the reporter gene. Within the above region, the fragment spanning nucleotides -158 to -90 was required for optimal transcription in monocytic cells. Biochemical analysis of the region -158/-90 revealed a binding site for transcription factors of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor (PEBP2/CBF) family at position -103. Disruption of the PEBP2/CBF site markedly diminished the role of the PEBP2/CBF factors in the constitutive transcription of the CD36 gene. The involvement of members of the PEBP2/CBF family in chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia, and in the transcriptional regulation of the myeloid-specific genes encoding for myeloperoxidase, elastase, and the colony-stimulating factor receptor, highlights the relevance of the regulation of the CD36 gene promoter in monocytic cells by members of the PEBP2/CBF family.","['Armesilla, A L', 'Calvo, D', 'Vega, M A']","['Armesilla AL', 'Calvo D', 'Vega MA']","['Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD36 Antigens/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/29 00:00,1996/03/29 00:01,['1996/03/29 00:00'],"['1996/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.13.7781 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45192-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 29;271(13):7781-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.13.7781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional activity, measured through the increase in haptoglobin production by HepG2 cells stimulated with IL-6, could be strongly inhibited by the extract. Similarly, IL-6-induced production of IgM by the B cell line SKW6.4 was substantially reduced. In neither cell line was there evidence of toxicity produced by the extract. Other sponges of the Callyspongia species were found to contain analogous activity. The activity was destroyed by trypsin treatment or boiling of the extract, suggesting that the inhibition is due to a protein. When the binding of IL-6 to its receptor complex was dissected in vitro, inhibition of binding of IL-6 to soluble receptor by the extract was not detected, but binding of the IL-6-sIL-6R complex to soluble gp130 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. This was borne out in cellular assays since the extract inhibited activation of HepG2 cells stimulated with oncostatin M or leukemia inhibitory factor, cytokines which also use gp130 for signal transduction. These results suggest that the Callyspongia extract contains a protein which blocks the interaction of the IL-6 family of cytokines with their signal transduction moiety, gp130. Elucidation of the structure and mode of action of such a protein would be helpful in designing gp130 antagonists to inhibit the functions of this cytokine family, overproduction of which has been associated with cancer and pathologies of autoimmune disease and AIDS.","['Peppard, J V', 'Loo, P', 'Sills, M A', 'Munster, D', 'Pomponi, S A', 'Wright, A E']","['Peppard JV', 'Loo P', 'Sills MA', 'Munster D', 'Pomponi SA', 'Wright AE']","['Pharmaceuticals Division, Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Summit, New Jersey 07901, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Haptoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Porifera/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/29 00:00,1996/03/29 00:01,['1996/03/29 00:00'],"['1996/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.13.7281 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45113-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 29;271(13):7281-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.13.7281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the functional importance of its trans-acting capacities in cell transformation, we have examined two representative pathways of transcriptional activation--HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR) mediated and NF-kappa B dependent--by mutational analysis of Tax. In contrast to a previous report, mutants lacking the ability to activate an NF-kappaB-dependent promoter failed to transform rat fibroblasts, whereas a mutation which abolishes the HTLV-I LTR-mediated trans-activation demonstrated a wild-type capacity for cell transformation. Stable expression of Tax competent for transformation caused enhanced DNA binding of NF-kappa B in rat fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that stable co-expression of the NFKB2 precursor, known as a member of the I kappa B proteins, with wild-type Tax blocked transformation as well as eliminated aberrant NF-kappaB activation by Tax without interference with the HTLV-I LTR-mediated trans-activation. Our results indicate that constitutive activation of NF-kappa B is essential for Tax-mediated transformation of rat fibroblasts.","['Yamaoka, S', 'Inoue, H', 'Sakurai, M', 'Sugiyama, T', 'Hazama, M', 'Yamada, T', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Yamaoka S', 'Inoue H', 'Sakurai M', 'Sugiyama T', 'Hazama M', 'Yamada T', 'Hatanaka M']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', '*Genes, pX', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry', 'Point Mutation', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Feb 15;15(4):873-87.,,,,,PMC450285,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, transfection of Tpl-2 into COS-1 cells or Jurkat T cells. markedly activated the MAP kinases, ERK-1 and SAP kinase (JNK), which are substrates for MEK-1 and SEK-1, respectively.

In this study diminished phosphorylation of LY-S topoisomerase I was observed for sites recognized by casein kinase 2 but not for those phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Tryptic digests of LY-S topoisomerase I labeled in vitro by casein kinase 2 indicated that phosphorylation was similarly lowered at different sites. Activity of casein kinase 2 measured in nuclear extracts was about 1.7 times lower for LY-S than LY-R cells. This difference was diminished or eliminated by increasing casein concentration, diluting the extract or increasing the ionic strength. Activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was 5.3 times higher in LY-S than in LY-R nuclei. When the activity of the polymerase was inhibited by treatment of LY-S cells with benzamide, casein kinase 2-catalyzed phosphorylation of topoisomerase I increased.

However, cells of the blood vessels can also participate in antitumor defense responses. They produce NO either constitutively [endothelial cells (ECs)] or after stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines (ECs and vascular smooth muscle cells). We have used a tumor cell-vascular cell coculture system to evaluate whether vascular cells can mediate cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Treatment with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced death of human erythroleukemic K562 cells cocultured with rodent vascular smooth muscle cells or ECs. The synergistic antitumor activity of the two cytokines depended on de novo gene expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase and on synthesis of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs) in the vascular cells. K562 cells did not produce any appreciable levels of NO, but they were targeted by RNIs released from the cytokine-stimulated vascular cells, as demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry, which showed formation of nonheme iron-nitrosyl complexes in the tumor cells. Assays for mitochondrial respiration demonstrated that the tumor cells suffered from a block of the complexes I and II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Further analysis of the cytotoxic mechanism by fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and DNA electrophoresis revealed that K562 cells attacked by NO-producing vascular cells underwent apoptosis with plasma membrane blebbing, cell volume reduction, condensation of cytoplasm and chromatin, and fragmentation of genomic DNA at internucleosomal sites. In contrast, only a few vascular cells exhibited these apoptotic changes, suggesting that these cells resist the RNI attack. Inhibition of NO production in vascular cells by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthases, significantly reduced the death of the K562 cells. These observations suggest that vascular cells induce apoptotic death of tumor cells by producing RNIs in response to cytokine stimulation.","['Geng, Y J', 'Hellstrand, K', 'Wennmalm, A', 'Hansson, G K']","['Geng YJ', 'Hellstrand K', 'Wennmalm A', 'Hansson GK']","['King Gustaf V Research Institute, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'omega-N-Methylarginine']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Feb 15;56(4):866-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation had rearranged the TCRA/D locus on chromosome band 14q11 and the locus encoding the tumor suppressor gene P16INK4/MTS1 (P16) on band 9p21 (D. Duro et al., Oncogene, 11: 21-29, 1995). In the present report, the breakpoints were precisely localized on each chromosome partner. On the 14q- derivative, the sequence derived from chromosome 9 was interrupted at 1.0 kb upstream of the first exon of P16, close to a consensus recombination heptamer, CACTGTG. In addition, the chromosome 14 breakpoint was localized at the end of the TCRD2 (delta 2) segment, and 22 residues with unknown origin were present at the translocation junction. On the 9p+ derivative, chromosome 9 sequences were in continuity with those displaced onto chromosome 14, and the 14q11 breakpoint was located within TCRJA29 segment. These features are consistent with aberrant activity of the TCR gene recombinase complex. Although all three coding exons of P16 were displaced onto the chromosome 14q-derivative, no P16 transcript was detected in the leukemic cells. Because the region spanning the P16 exon 1 was not inactivated by methylation and because the other P16 allele was deleted, the implication is that the chromosome breakpoint was likely to disrupt regulatory elements involved in the normal expression of the gene. As a whole, then, our results show that translocations affecting band 9p21 can participate to the inactivation of P16, thus justifying a systematic survey of translocations of the 9p21 band in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Duro, D', 'Bernard, O', 'Della Valle, V', 'Leblanc, T', 'Berger, R', 'Larsen, C J']","['Duro D', 'Bernard O', 'Della Valle V', 'Leblanc T', 'Berger R', 'Larsen CJ']","['Unite 301 INSERM, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Exons', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Feb 15;56(4):848-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether changes occur in the levels of AP-2-binding activity in HTLV-I-infected cell lines, we compared the levels of AP-2 binding of nuclear extracts obtained from HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines with those of nuclear extracts obtained from uninfected T-cell lines. High levels of AP-2-binding activity were observed in HTLV-I-infected cell lines (MT-2, HUT-102, and SLB-1) using the mobility shift assay. In contrast, in the uninfected cell lines (Jurkat, HUT-78, and MLA 144), AP-2-binding activity was obviously low compared with that in the HTLV-I-infected cell lines. HTLV-I transactivator protein tax activates expression of both viral and cellular genes. We have demonstrated further that introduction of the tax gene into Jurkat cells stimulated AP-2-binding activity.

PEITC occurs as a constituent of certain cruciferous vegetables, PHITC is a synthetic homologue, and NAC is an endogenous substance. Male F344 rats were treated with the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) by s.c. injection at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg body weight three times weekly for 20 weeks. This dose regimen induced a 67% tumor incidence in the lung, a major target organ of NNK. PHITC or PEITC administered in the diet for 22 weeks, a period covering from 1 week before to 1 week after the NNK treatment, exhibited significant inhibition of lung tumorigenesis induced by NNK. The lung tumor incidences in the NNK-treated groups, fed a diet containing 4 mmol/kg (876 ppm) or 2 mmol/kg (438 ppm) PHITC, were 24 and 19% and were 9 and 17% in groups fed PEITC at concentrations of 8 mmol/kg (1304 ppm) or 4 mmol/kg (652 ppm), respectively. In contrast to isothiocyanates, NAC given in the diet at 80 mmol/kg (13056 ppm) or 40 mmol/kg (6528 ppm) exerted no inhibitory effects on the NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis. At the dose studied, NNK did not induce liver and pancreatic tumors in the treated animals, but a significant increase of nasal cavity tumor incidence was observed in the NNK-treated group. However, none of the test compounds showed any effect on the tumorigenesis in this tissue.

Recent studies have shown that the FAS inhibitor, cerulenin, is selectively cytotoxic to cell lines derived from human malignancies, suggesting that those carcinoma cells are dependent upon endogenous fatty acid synthesis for growth. These data further suggest that the fatty acid synthesis pathway is a potential target for chemotherapy development. The present studies demonstrate that cerulenin cytotoxicity is mediated by fatty acid pathway inhibition. Proliferating HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells express high levels of FAS mRNA and protein and synthesize fatty acid predominantly for membrane phospholipid. Following exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the FAS expression in HL60 cells is abolished, fatty acid synthesis diminishes, and the cells become insensitive to cerulenin while acquiring a differentiated, macrophage-like phenotype. HL60 cells adapted to growth in serum- and fatty acid-free medium show a dose-dependent sensitivity to cerulenin, which is reversed by palmitate, the major product of FAS, indicating that cerulenin cytotoxicity is mediated through fatty acid starvation. Cells grown in the presence of exogenous fatty acid partially downmodulate FAS expression and increase mean cell volume (phospholipid mass/cell) but retain their sensitivity to cerulenin, which is reversed by 3-fold excess oleate supplementation. These results demonstrate that malignant cells can retain dependence on endogenous fatty acid synthesis and sensitivity to FAS inhibitors in the presence of physiological fatty acid levels and thus support the notion that FAS inhibitors may be useful in treating cancer in vivo.","['Pizer, E S', 'Wood, F D', 'Pasternack, G R', 'Kuhajda, F P']","['Pizer ES', 'Wood FD', 'Pasternack GR', 'Kuhajda FP']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '17397-89-6 (Cerulenin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cerulenin/*toxicity', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Fatty Acid Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids/pharmacology', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Feb 15;56(4):745-51.,,,,['T32 AI 07247/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous evidence has pointed to a related gene, p16INK4A, as the principal target of this deletion. We report that in gliomas and, to a striking degree, in leukemias, the p15 gene is commonly inactivated in association with promoter region hypermethylation involving multiple sites in a 5'-CpG island. In some gliomas and all of the primary leukemias, this event occurs without alteration of the adjacent gene, p16INK4A. In other tumors, including lung, head and neck, breast, prostate, and colon cancer, inactivation of p15INK4B occurs only rarely and only with concomitant inactivation of p16. Aberrant methylation of p15INK4B is associated with transcriptional loss of this gene. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine leads to re-expression of p15 mRNA. In selected leukemia cell lines, p15 inactivation correlates with known resistance to the growth-suppressive effects of transforming growth factor-beta. These results suggest that p15INK4B is inactivated selectively in leukemias and gliomas and seems to constitute an important tumor suppressor gene loss in these neoplasms.","['Herman, J G', 'Jen, J', 'Merlo, A', 'Baylin, S B']","['Herman JG', 'Jen J', 'Merlo A', 'Baylin SB']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA/blood/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/analysis', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Glioma/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Feb 15;56(4):722-7.,,,,"['CA-43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-58184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlations and discrepancies with bone marrow cytology.,69-75,"The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the purpose of repeated follow-up examination of bone marrow samples from 38 leukemia patients was investigated. On the basis of conventional cytogenetic analysis, patients with acute leukemia whose leukemic cells carried numerical chromosomal aberrations were selected and followed with repetitive DNA probes that specifically hybridize to one chromosome type. Repeated cytogenetic metaphase analyses would have been laborious and not sensitive or quantitative enough to follow declining numbers of aberrant cells. FISH, as an interphase cytogenetic technique, provides a rapid and simple alternative with high sensitivity. Although FISH data before and after chemotherapy were in agreement with bone marrow cytology in 30 of 38 patients, discrepancies were noticed in specific cases. These could be explained by the presence of cytogenetically distinct subclones that behave differently during treatment, the presence of differentiated leukemic cells, changes in the chromosomal constitution caused by clonal relapse, or the fact that a numerical aberration is found by conventional chromosome banding analysis while the target region to which the probe is directed is still present in the nucleus as a diploid set.","['Arkesteijn, G J', 'Erpelinck, S L', 'Martens, A C', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Arkesteijn GJ', 'Erpelinck SL', 'Martens AC', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Remission Induction', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'X Chromosome', 'Y Chromosome']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165460895002782 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00278-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 May;88(1):69-75. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00278-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No association with a specific morphology or specific immunophenotype for both structural aberrations has been established. The association of structural aberrations involving regions 14q11-12 and T-cell ALL, however, has been observed, as an aberration was identified in two (3.6%) children, i.e., in 25% of our T-cell leukemias. Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13, a rare chromosomal aberration in ALL, was identified in addition to del(9)(q31) in a 17-month-old girl with constitutional trisomy of chromosome 21 and B-cell ALL-L2.

Children of African, Polynesian, Native American, and Mexican ancestry had a less favorable outcome than children of European ancestry when treated in a similar manner by the same physicians and nurses. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of the 94 European-American (E-A) and 84 Mexican-American (M-A) Texas children registered and treated in national collaborative ALL therapy trials at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston between 1974 and 1985 and followed through June 1994. Information was collected regarding age, sex, presenting clinical features, risk for relapse grouping, protocol assignment, event free survival, and the financial status of their families. Cure was defined as initial continuous complete remission for more than seven years and cessation of therapy for more than four years. Presenting characteristics of E-A and M-A children were compared, and then related to cure rates by univariate and multivariate analyses. Event free survival rates of E-A and M-A children were determined together and by sex. RESULTS: Comparing presenting features, financial status as identified by pay code was significantly less for M-A children. Other features were not significantly different. By univariate analysis, an age of 2 to 6 years, female sex, initial white blood cell count below 10,000/microL, low risk grouping, registration on the most recent protocol, and full pay status were significantly associated with higher cure rates. By multivariate analysis, male gender, high risk group, and registration on earlier protocols were found to be significantly associated with a low cure rate. Event free survival and cure rate were lower for M-A children, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Further study of larger numbers of patients, including contemporary immunophenotypic and genotypic characterization of ALL, is needed for better definition of possible ethnic differences. Ethnicity and financial status should be included in the analysis of clinical trials of ALL therapy.","['Hord, M H', 'Smith, T L', 'Culbert, S J', 'Frankel, L S', 'Pinkel, D P']","['Hord MH', 'Smith TL', 'Culbert SJ', 'Frankel LS', 'Pinkel DP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

The histologic and immunophenotypic features of these lesions are not well characterized. Appearance of skin lesions in B-CLL patients is considered a poor prognostic sign. METHOD: Eight punch biopsies from five patients (three males, two females; mean age, 66.7 years) affected by B-CLL and presenting with lesions at sites of previous herpes simplex (upper lip, one patient) or herpes zoster (trunk, four patients; forehead, one patient) infections were included in the study. Histologic examination was performed on routine sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Giemsa. Immunohistologic stainings were performed with a standard three-step immunoperoxidase technique on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: Specific cutaneous infiltrates of B-CLL were diagnosed histopathologically and immunophenotypically in eight biopsies from all five patients. Clinically, patients presented with erythematous papules or plaques confined to the area of previous herpes virus eruptions. Histopathologic features in most cases were characterized by a variably dense perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of small hyperchromatic lymphocytes throughout the entire dermis, reaching the subcutaneous fat. In one case, a dense, diffuse infiltrate involving the entire dermis was observed. A granulomatous reaction with presence of epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells was a prominent feature in four biopsies from three patients. Light areas containing large lymphoid cells with features of prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts (so-called ""proliferation centers"") could be observed only in the case characterized by a diffuse infiltrate. Immunohistology revealed an aberrant CD20+/CD43+ phenotype of neoplastic B cells, which is not found in normal B lymphocytes (CD20+/CD43-). Reactive T lymphocytes were present in all lesions and had a normal CD20-/CD43+/CD45Ro+ phenotype. At the time of this writing, four patients were alive without signs of skin disease after a mean follow-up of 58.5 months, and one patient died of B-CLL 24 months after the cutaneous eruption. CONCLUSIONS: Specific cutaneous infiltrates of B-CLL are not uncommon at sites of herpes virus scars. The diagnosis can be confirmed by histopathologic and immunophenotypic criteria. The prognosis is better than previously reported.","['Cerroni, L', 'Zenahlik, P', 'Kerl, H']","['Cerroni L', 'Zenahlik P', 'Kerl H']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cicatrix/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Herpes Simplex', '*Herpes Zoster', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950701)76:1<26::aid-cncr2820760105>3.0.co;2-j [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Jul 1;76(1):26-31. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950701)76:1<26::aid-cncr2820760105>3.0.co;2-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs inhibit the release of chemical mediators including the leukotrienes; however, the mechanism involved is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanism of inhibition, we investigated the effects of three drugs on the function of phospholipase A2, 5-lipoxygenase, leukotriene C4 synthase, and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, which are all catabolic enzymes involved in synthesizing leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: The production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All three drugs inhibited the production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 when cells were stimulated with A23187. All three drugs also inhibited the A23187-stimulated release of 3H-arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Azelastine inhibited the production of leukotriene C4, but not leukotriene B4, when either arachidonic acid or leukotriene A4 free acid was used as the substrate in our cell free system. Oxatomide and ketotifen did not inhibit the synthesis of either leukotriene C4 or leukotriene B4 in the same cell free study. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that oxatomide and ketotifen inhibit the production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 by inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity, whereas, azelastine inhibits the leukotriene C4 production by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and leukotriene C4 synthase.","['Hamasaki, Y', 'Shafigeh, M', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Sato, R', 'Zaitu, M', 'Muro, E', 'Kobayashi, I', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Tasaki, H', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Hamasaki Y', 'Shafigeh M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Sato R', 'Zaitu M', 'Muro E', 'Kobayashi I', 'Ichimaru T', 'Tasaki H', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",9503580,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)', 'ZQI909440X (azelastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/drug effects', 'Glutathione Transferase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Leukotriene C4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phthalazines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1081-1206(10)63465-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63465-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1996 May;76(5):469-75. doi: 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63465-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A familial distribution was observed in one group but most cases were not consanguinous. Ferrets greater than 3 years of age developed chronic disease in two of the groups and 2-year-old adults had acute disease in the remaining group. Lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy were prominent features. Histologically, predominantly small noncleaved cell and polymorphous lymphoid lesions were observed. All of the ferrets with lymphoma that were tested for ADV and FeLV using serology or PCR were negative. The rate of ADV antibody among cases or ferrets at risk was not significantly different from controls. None of the cluster ferrets were seropositive for FeLV p27 antigen using a monoclonal ELISA.

Bubble PCR was used to amplify the genomic BCR-ABL translocation breakpoints from chronic-phase DNA of 10 patients with CML who subsequently underwent BMT. After cloning and sequencing of the amplification products, patient-specific ABL primers were synthesized and tested for both specificity and sensitivity in nested or heminested combinations with a variety of primers derived from the major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene. In all cases, combinations of primers were selected that enabled the detection of chronic-phase DNA from a specific patient at up to a 10(5)x dilution into DNA from a normal individual. Patterns of residual disease obtained by serial RT-PCR and DNA-PCR analyses of blood and bone marrow samples obtained after BMT were similar for most patients, including one treated for relapse by infusion of donor leukocytes. Of the 24 samples for direct comparison of RT-PCR and DNA-PCR, results were concordant in 19 (79%) cases. Five results were discordant. In two instances, RT-PCR was positive, while PCR from genomic DNA was negative; this discrepancy might have arisen due to the slightly greater sensitivity of RT-PCR compared with DNA-PCR. In three samples from three patients, two of whom had been transplanted in the accelerated phase, PCR from genomic DNA was positive while RT-PCR was negative; this could mean that some CML cells in these samples had a reduced or absent capacity to express BCR-ABL mRNA post-transplant. Of these three patients, one subsequently relapsed; and two are in remission at 21 and 24 months after the discordant result. Thus, the finding of a single DNA-PCR- positive, RT-PCR-negative results does not necessarily predict relapse. Because the great majority of samples (79%) gave concordant results with the two assays, we believe that patients in remission do not generally harbor a substantial pool of CML cells that do not express BCR-ABL mRNA.","['Zhang, J G', 'Lin, F', 'Chase, A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Zhang JG', 'Lin F', 'Chase A', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cell Survival', '*DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65262-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2588-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to understand the mechanism of LCR function during early stages of erythropoiesis, a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method has been developed to examine the chromatin structure/DNase I hypersensitivity of the LCR in progenitor cells logistically available in limited cell numbers. In erythroid progenitors as well as in multipotent cells with erythroid potential, hypersensitive sites HS4, 3, 2, and 1 were present and the chromatin structure of the LCR was accessible. Moreover, the chromatin structure of the LCR underwent dynamic changes during erythropoiesis. In early erythroid progenitors, the HS2 site was more accessible than the HS3 site. In more mature erythroid progenitors, HS2 became less accessible than HS3 and the other sites. The results indicate that the transcriptional program of the globin genes is encoded, at least in part, in the chromatin accessibility of the LCR.

The human beta-globin gene with its immediate flanking sequences does not contain all the regulatory elements necessary for regulated high-level and position-independent expression in erythroid cells. The regulatory element known as the beta-globin locus control region (BetaLCR) can provide a linked Beta-globin gene with these properties. However, addition of BetaLCR sequences to a retrovirus carrying a beta-globin gene increases its genetic instability. We have developed a new generation of retroviral vectors in which a human gamma-globin gene is placed under the control of the alphaLCR, the major regulatory element of the alpha-globin gene cluster. We demonstrate that these retroviruses are genetically stable in producer cell lines and can be produced at high titers that exceed 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. In addition, we show that the transduced gamma-globin gene can be expressed in the adult erythroid environment of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells at a level comparable to that of a single endogenous Betamaj-globin gene. These retroviruses can also transduce primary murine bone marrow progenitor cells as efficiently as retroviruses that carry the neomycin resistance (neor) gene. This new generation of globin retroviral vectors may prove useful for gene therapy of human beta-globin gene disorders such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.","['Ren, S', 'Wong, B Y', 'Li, J', 'Luo, X N', 'Wong, P M', 'Atweh, G F']","['Ren S', 'Wong BY', 'Li J', 'Luo XN', 'Wong PM', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/genetics/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thalassemia/genetics/therapy']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65254-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2518-24.,,,,"['DK 41298/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 466547/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the molecular processes that promote multiple IgH rearrangements, a comprehensive sequence analysis of a B-ALL case was performed in which seven clonal IgH gene rearrangements were identified. The genetic profiles suggested that a single leukemic progenitor clone evolved into several subclones through dual processes of variable (VH) to preexisting diversity-joining (DJH) gene segment rearrangement and VH to VH gene replacement. Predominant IgH-V usage and the uniquely rearranged clonotype-specific VHDJH region gene sequences were identified using a novel DNA-based gene amplification strategy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was directed by an IgH-J generic primer and a complement of family-specific IgH-V primers that defined the major B-cell IgH-V gene usage. Clonality of rearranged VHDJH bands was substantiated by high resolution denaturant gel electrophoretic analysis. Sequence patterns of the amplified VHDJH fragments segregated into two groups defined by common DJH sequences. Partial N region homology at the VHD junction as well as shared DJH sequences firmly established VH to VHDJH gene replacement as a mechanism generating clonal evolution in one group. In the second subset, oligoclonality was propagated by independent VH gene rearrangements to a common DJH precursor. The contributions of all clonal Ig-VHDJH repertoires for each group was approximately 50% and reflected a symmetric distribution of leukemic subclones generated by either process. Thus, oligoclonal rearrangements evolved by two independent, yet seemingly contemporaneous molecular genetic mechanisms. All seven clones displayed nonfunctional Ig-VHDJH recombinations. These observations may have relevance to the recombinatorial opportunities available during normal B-cell maturation.","['Choi, Y', 'Greenberg, S J', 'Du, T L', 'Ward, P M', 'Overturf, P M', 'Brecher, M L', 'Ballow, M']","['Choi Y', 'Greenberg SJ', 'Du TL', 'Ward PM', 'Overturf PM', 'Brecher ML', 'Ballow M']","['Department of Neurology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65252-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2506-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL rearrangement was found in 6 of 29 (20%) AML M1 and 6 of 10 AML M5 cases. RT-PCR characterization of 11 cases showed four MLL self-fusions, four MLL-AF6, two MLL-AF9, including a novel AF9 breakpoint, and one uncharacterized t(11:19). Only 5 of 10 MLL-rearranged cases tested demonstrated karyotypic 11q23 abnormalities. FISH analysis of nine cases with an MLL-specific yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) confirmed the cytogenetic abnormalities in two cases, clarified them in one, and did not detect six cases, including three MLL self-fusions, one case with a probable MLL-rearranged subclone not represented karyotypically, and twoMLL-AF6. A whole chromosome 11 paint detected one of these MLL-AF6, and an AF6 cosmid demonstrated that the other was probably due to insertion of a submicroscopic portion of chromosome 6, including part of AF6, into an apparently normal chromosome 11.

One type of lymphocytes that may contribute to this effect are natural killer cells (NK), which after activation with interleukin (IL)-2, exhibit a broad range of cytolytic activity against allogeneic and autologous cells. We have previously demonstrated that IL-2-activated NK (ANK) can be generated from blood of patients with CML and are benign in origin. Their proliferation and function, however, diminish with disease progression in CML, suggesting a role in tumor surveillance. We studied the effect of IL-2-activated NK (ANK) on normal and malignant primitive and committed progenitors in a novel long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) assay. Because ANK destroy marrow stromal layers, the use of classic stroma-dependent long-term cultures is not possible. Therefore, we used the stroma noncontact LTBMC system developed in our laboratory to analyze the effect of autologous ANK cells on primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Autologous ANK (CD56+/CD3-) were generated from the peripheral blood of 10 patients with chronic phase CML and from six normal individuals by culturing CD5/CD8-depleted mononuclear cells for 14 days in 1,000 U/mL IL-2. At the same time ANK cultures were initiated, sorted normal (CD34+/DR+) marrow populations were plated in Transwell inserts of the stroma noncontact culture. On day 15, hydrocortisone, which rapidly inhibits ANK function, was removed, and autologous ANK were added to the Transwell inserts with fresh LTBMC medium without hydrocortisone but supplemented with 1,000 U/mL IL-2. After 48 hours, the number of colony-forming cells (CFC) was enumerated in methylcellulose culture. To determine the effect of ANK on more primitive long-term culture-initiating cells (LTCIC), the IL-2-supplemented LTBMC medium was replaced with fresh hydrocortisone containing LTBMC medium, and cultures were maintained for an additional 5 weeks. We demonstrate that autologous ANK did not suppress normal CFC or LTCIC. In contrast, ANK from eight patients with CML with potent cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive (K562) NK-resistant (Raji) tumor targets exhibited an ANK dose-dependent suppression of both CFC and LTCIC. Interestingly, ANK from two patients with CML who exhibited diminished cytotoxicity also did not suppress autologous CFC and LTCIC. These studies indicate that ANK with potent major histocompatibility complex unrestricted cytotoxic activity suppress malignant hematopoiesis. This effect was not mediated by soluble factors and was absolutely dependent on direct cell-to-cell contact. We further demonstrate that the beta2 integrin receptor is involved in ANK recognition of CML targets. These observations support the use of autologous ANK therapy to prevent relapse of CML after autologous marrow transplantation or use of ANK to purge CML marrow for autologous transplantation.","['Cervantes, F', 'Pierson, B A', 'McGlave, P B', 'Verfaillie, C M', 'Miller, J S']","['Cervantes F', 'Pierson BA', 'McGlave PB', 'Verfaillie CM', 'Miller JS']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65249-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2476-85.,,,,"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-64593-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in remission duration (P = .075) and overall survival (P = .058) approached significance only for LRP. Sequential specimens from remitting patients receiving treatment with the Pgp modulator cyclosporin-A showed emergence of the LRP phenotype despite a decrease or loss of Pgp at the time of treatment failure (P =.0304). Significant associations were observed between LRP and age greater than 55 years (P = .017), Pgp (P = .040), and prior treatment with mitoxantrone (P = .020) but not with CD34.

In contrast to their normal counterparts, CML progenitors adhere poorly to bone marrow stroma or fibronectin (FN). Aside from anchoring progenitors in the marrow microenvironment, beta1 integrin-dependent adhesion of normal progenitors is also associated with inhibition of their proliferation. As the beta1 integrin expression on CML progenitors is normal, we hypothesized that decreased integrin affinity may underlie the abnormal adhesive and proliferative characteristics of CML progenitors. We examined the effect of affinity modulation by the activating antibody 8A2 on the adhesion and proliferation of CML progenitors and the CML cell line, K562. 8A2 induced alpha5Beta1-dependent adhesion of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CD34+/HLA-DR+ cells and K562 cells to FN. Increased adhesion was 8A2- and FN concentration-dependent, time-dependent, and energy-dependent. Further, 8A2-induced adhesion to FN significantly inhibited the proliferation of malignant CML progenitors as well as K562 cells independent of cell differentiation, necrosis, or apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that affinity modulation of the alpha5Beta1 integrin on CML progenitors and K562 cells by 8A2 results in increased adhesion to FN with subsequent decreased proliferation, suggesting that decreased beta1 integrin affinity contributes to the abnormal circulation and proliferation of malignant progenitors in CML.","['Lundell, B I', 'McCarthy, J B', 'Kovach, N L', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Lundell BI', 'McCarthy JB', 'Kovach NL', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455-0315, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', '*Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65245-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2450-8.,,,,"['R01 CA 4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 48738-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 49930 01AZ/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the p75 IL-2Rbeta- and the p64 IL-2Rgamma-chain was a common finding in most of the myeloid cell samples investigated, whereas IL-2Ralpha-chain was less frequently expressed. Although the high-affinity IL-2R form (ie, the alpha+, beta+, gamma+ IL-2R form) was detectable in a small minority of primary AML samples as well as the KG-1 cell line and IL-2 binding to these cells was sufficient to initiate signal transduction as evidenced by an increase in overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation and more specifically in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus kinase (JAK) 3, in none of these cell types did exposure to IL-2 affect cell growth kinetics. These results suggest that, in myeloid cells, the IL-2R may not stimulate mitogenic responses or that its components may be expressed in a combinational association with receptors for other cytokines and that IL-2Rgamma may play a regulatory role in normal and malignant myelopoiesis possibly independent from IL-2. Because recent studies by others have indicated that the IL-2Rgamma- chain may be shared by the IL-4R, the IL-7R, and most likely the IL-9R, expression of mRNA of these receptor types was also investigated in these cell samples. Surprisingly, in a substantial part of the myeloid lineage cells examined, an IL-2Rgamma+, IL-4R-, IL7R- configuration was noted that was, however, frequently associated with expression of IL-9R. Sharing of IL-9R/IL-2R components was furthermore suggested by inhibition of 125I-IL-2 binding to primary AML cells with excess of unlabeled IL-9.","['Schumann, R R', 'Nakarai, T', 'Gruss, H J', 'Brach, M A', 'von Arnim, U', 'Kirschning, C', 'Karawajew, L', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Renauld, J C', 'Ritz, J', 'Herrmann, F']","['Schumann RR', 'Nakarai T', 'Gruss HJ', 'Brach MA', 'von Arnim U', 'Kirschning C', 'Karawajew L', 'Ludwig WD', 'Renauld JC', 'Ritz J', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Applied Molecular Biology, Virchow Klinikum der Humboldt Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL9R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-9)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', 'Receptors, Interleukin-9', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65241-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2419-27.,,,,['CA 41619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A proportion (15.2%) of NK cells that were stimulated for 3 days with IL-2 and then incubated for 4 hours with K562 cells showed rapid cell death, but NK cells not stimulated with IL-2 did not. This cell death was found to involve nuclear condensation and fragmentation and DNA cleavage, all of which are characteristic of apoptosis.

Drug-resistant leukemic cell lines have more active mitochondrial function, which is associated with a greater susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced respiratory inhibition. TNFalpha blocked electron transfer at three sites, NADH dehydrogenase (complex I), succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Respiratory rate and electron transport chain enzyme activities were significantly inhibited in the drug-resistant, TNF-sensitive cell lines. Respiratory inhibition preceded cell death by at least 5 to 8 hours. The respiratory failure was not compensated for by appropriate up-regulation of the glycolytic pathway. Increasing mitochondrial respiratory rate and enzyme activities by long-term culture with 2 mmol/L adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and Pi sensitized both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells to TNFalpha-induced cytolysis. Intramitochondrial free radicals generated by paraquat only had a limited and delayed effect on respiratory inhibition and cytolysis in comparison with the effect of TNFalpha. We conclude that TNFalpha-induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells is, at least in part, mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Free radical generation by TNFalpha may not directly lead to the observed inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport and other mechanisms must be involved.","['Jia, L', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Grahn, M F', 'Jiang, X R', 'Newland, A C']","['Jia L', 'Kelsey SM', 'Grahn MF', 'Jiang XR', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, London Hospital Medical College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.5.1 (Electron Transport Complex II)', 'EC 1.3.99.1 (Succinate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Depression, Chemical', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electron Transport/*drug effects', 'Electron Transport Complex II', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Free Radicals', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Paraquat/pharmacology', 'Succinate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65239-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2401-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of the bone marrow following in vivo irradiation or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment, in vitro culture with differentiation-inducing factors and long-term culture, and cell sorting all pointed in the same direction: the protein was found in early myeloid cells and in hematopoietic precursor cells. These results were in accordance with the specific presence of p49 in primary radiation-induced myeloid leukemia and its absence in spontaneous B lymphoma. Immunofluorescent staining using B92 antibody detected a nuclear antigen forming a dotted pattern in early myeloid cells and day 12 colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S). Nuclear localization of p49 was further demonstrated by subcellular fractionation followed by Western blotting. We thus identified a nuclear protein that within the hematopoietic population is detected in hematopoietic precursor cells, predominates in early myeloid cells, and is reduced following differentiation.

The pathogenesis of hematologic disorders such as aplastic anemia and the development of neoplasia are believed to involve dysregulation of apoptosis. To quantitate accurately the proportion of apoptosis cells within different cell types of a heterogeneous cell population such as blood or bone marrow, a method is required that combines the analysis of large numbers of cells with concurrent immunophenotyping of cell surface antigens. In this study, we have evaluated such a method using the fluorescent DNA binding agent, 7-amino actinomycin D (7AAD), to stain three diverse human cell lines, induced to undergo apoptosis by three different stimuli. Flow cytometric analysis defines three populations on the basis of 7AAD fluorescence and forward light scatter. We have shown by cell sorting and subsequent morphological assessment and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling that the populations defined by 7AAD represent live, apoptotic, and late-apoptotic/dead cells. This method is quick, simple, reproducible, and cheap and will be a valuable tool in the investigation of the role of apoptosis in normal physiology and in disease states.","['Philpott, N J', 'Turner, A J', 'Scopes, J', 'Westby, M', 'Marsh, J C', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Dalgleish, A G', 'Gibson, F M']","['Philpott NJ', 'Turner AJ', 'Scopes J', 'Westby M', 'Marsh JC', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Dalgleish AG', 'Gibson FM']","[""Division of Haematology, Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Separation', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65219-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2244-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that the membrane-bound form of Steel factor (SLF) induces more persistent tyrosine kinase activation and longer life span of c-kit encoded protein (KIT) than its soluble form (Miyazawa et al, Blood 85:641, 1995). In this study, we used YB5.B8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that recognizes the extracellular domain of KIT to investigate whether immobilized anti-KIT MoAb can substitute for SLF as a potent activator of KIT by cross-linking receptors and further compared its effect with each SLF isoform in a factor-dependent cell line M07e. YB5.B8 MoAb in a soluble state suppressed SLF-induced M07e cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, once this antibody was immobilized on the goat-antimouse MoAb (GAM)-coated culture plates, it supported the growth of M07e cells in the absence of any growth factors, whereas culture the cells in GAM alone or YB5.B8 without GAM-coated plates resulted in rapid cell-death within 24 hours. As with the natural ligand SLF, immobilized YB5.B8 MoAb synergized with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in inducing cell proliferation compared with either YB5.B8 MoAb or GM-CSF alone. Immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine MoAb showed that interaction of M07e cells with immobilized YB5.B8 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a series of intracellular proteins including KIT (145 kD). In addition, cross-linking studies using a water-soluble cross linking reagent bis-sulfosuccinimidyl-suberate showed that immobilized YB5.B8 MoAb induced dimerization and activation of KIT. However, as with stimulation by the membrane-bound form of SLF, the kinetics of KIT activation with YB5.B8 MoAb was more prolonged compared with the cells treated with recombinant soluble SLF. Flow cytometry showed that, unlike the cells treated with soluble SLF, no downmodulation of cell-surface KIT expression was observed in M07e cells cultured with immobilzed YB5.B8 MoAb. These data suggest that immobilized antibodies against hematopoietic receptors may replace their ligand-stimulators; however, their activities may resemble the membrane-bound form rather than the soluble form of natural ligands.","['Kurosawa, K', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Gotoh, A', 'Katagiri, T', 'Nishimaki, J', 'Ashman, L K', 'Toyama, K']","['Kurosawa K', 'Miyazawa K', 'Gotoh A', 'Katagiri T', 'Nishimaki J', 'Ashman LK', 'Toyama K']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Tokyo Medical College, Tokyo Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Goats', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Stem Cell Factor/*chemistry']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65218-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2235-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the expression of Tie was studied in human hematopoietic cells of various sources. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were Tie-. However, a large fraction of CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and bone marrow (BM) expressed tie protein and mRNA. On average, 64% of the fluorescence-activated cell sorting-gated UCB CD34+ cells including CD38- cells and a fraction of cells expressing low levels of c-Kit were Tie+. Also, 30% to 60% of BM CD34+ cells were Tie+, including most of the BM CD34+CD38-, CD34+Thy-1+, and CD34+HLA-DR- cells. Under culture conditions allowing myeloid, erythroid, and/or megakaryocytic differentiation, purified UCB CD34+ cells lost Tie mRNA and protein expression concomitantly with that of CD34; however, a significant fraction of cells expressed Tie during megakaryocytic differentiation.

Until recently, no cure existed for patients who relapsed post-BMT. We present our long-term observations on remission induction, after relapse post-BMT, by allogeneic cell therapy (allo-CT) and the feasibility of remission induction in allo-CT-resistant patients by activation of antileukemia effector cells with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) in vitro and in vivo. The longest observation of successful allo-CT (event-free survival, greater than 8 years) was made in a patient with resistant pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia who received infusions with graded increments of donor (female) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as soon as bulky hematologic and extramedullary relapse was noticed early post-BMT. The patient is currently without evidence of residual host (male) cells as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of 17 patients with acute and chronic leukemia in relapse after BMT, 10 were reinduced into complete remission. Four patients with cytogenetic relapse responded to allo-CT alone, while five of six patients with overt hematologic relapse responded only after additional activation of donor with rhIL-2. Allo-CT can, therefore, successfully reverse chemoradiotherapy-resistant relapse of both acute and chronic leukemia. Moreover, in patients resistant to donor lymphocyte infusion, remission can be accomplished by additionally activating donor PBL in vitro and/or in vivo with rhIL-2. Based on our observations, after BMT, allo-CT should be considered the treatment of choice for patients with hematologic malignancies resistant to conventional anticancer modalities. Allogeneic activated cell therapy (allo ACT) should be considered for patients with tumor cells resistant to allo-CT. Although allo-CT, followed if indicated by allo-ACT, can be effective for patients with overt hematologic relapse, reversal of persistent minimal residual disease or documented molecular/cytogenetic relapse early after BMT may also be considered as a possible indication for allo-CT.","['Slavin, S', 'Naparstek, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Samuel, S', 'Kapelushnik, J', 'Brautbar, C', 'Or, R']","['Slavin S', 'Naparstek E', 'Nagler A', 'Ackerstein A', 'Samuel S', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Brautbar C', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65214-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2195-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells have been assumed to express an immature phenotype and to produce most colony-forming units (CFU-AML). For one case of AML (French-American-British [FAB] M1, normal cytogenetics), we examined the capacity of the CD34+ (25% of unseparated AML cells) and CD34- fractions to initiate leukemia in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. In addition, the production of CFU-AML and nucleated cells (NC) of these subsets was investigated in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC). The frequencies of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) were also estimated; early appearing cobblestone areas (CAs) are indicative of relatively mature progenitors and late CAs represent the progeny of primitive progenitors. In mice transplanted with CD34- (98% pure) or CD34+ (98% pure) grafts, similar AML cell growth was seen throughout an observation period of 106 days. The capacity to establish long-term growth from the CD34- cells was confirmed by renewed outgrowth after retransplantation. In vitro, the CD34- fraction contained both immature and mature CAFCs and produced high numbers of CFU-AML and NC in LTBMC. The CD34+ fraction produced only small numbers of CFU-AML, NC, and mature CAFCs. Therefore, the expression of CD34 and the content of CFU-AML were not associated with long-term growth of AML. However, similar frequencies of primitive CAFCs were observed in both fractions. Thus, both CD34- and CD34+ subsets of this AML sample contained immature progenitors with the capacity to initiate long-term AML growth as characterized in vivo (in SCID mice) as well as in vitro (in CAFC assay), indicating asynchrony between functional and immunophenotypical maturation of AML progenitor cell compartments.","['Terpstra, W', 'Prins, A', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Wognum, B W', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Wielenga, J J']","['Terpstra W', 'Prins A', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Wognum BW', 'Wagemaker G', 'Lowenberg B', 'Wielenga JJ']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD34', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Separation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Connective Tissue Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65213-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Mar 15;87(6):2187-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two genes have been identified, the multiple tumor-suppressor gene 1 (MTS1) and multiple tumor-suppressor gene 2 (MTS2), whose products inhibit cell cycle progression. A characterization of the MTS locus organization allowed to determine the incidence of MTS1 and MTS2 inactivation in T-ALL. MTS1 and MTS2 configurations were determined by Southern blotting using 8 probes in 59 patients with T-ALL (40 children and 19 adults). Biallelic MTS1 inactivation by deletions and/or rearrangements was observed in 45 cases (76%). Monoallelic alterations were found in 6 cases (10%). The second MTS1 allele was studied in the 4 cases with available material. A point mutation was found in 2 cases. The lack of MTS1 mRNA expression was observed by Northern blot analysis in a third case. A normal single-strand conformation polymorphism pattern of MTS1 exons 1alpha and 2 was found and MTS1 RNA was detected in the fourth case, but a rearrangement occurring 5' to MTS1 exon 1 alpha deleting MTS1 exon 1Beta was documented. One case presented a complex rearrangement. Germline configuration for MTS1 and MTS2 was found in only 7 cases. The localization of the 17 breakpoints occurring in the MTS locus were determined. Ten of them (59%) are clustered in a 6-kb region located 5 kb downstream to the newly identified MTS1 exon 1Beta. No rearrangement disrupting MTS2 was detected and more rearrangements spared MTS2 than MTS1 (P<.01). MTS1 but not MTS2 RNA was detected by Northern blotting in the human thymus. These data strongly suggest that MTS1 is the functional target of rearrangements in T-ALL.

Mice deficient in IL-1Beta, IL-1Beta converting enzyme, and IL-1R type I have also been studied. Humans have been injected with IL-1 (either IL-1alpha or IL-1beta) for enhancing bone marrow recovery and for cancer treatment. The IL-1-specific receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has also been tested in clinical trials. The topics discussed in this review include production and activities of IL-1 and IL-1Ra molecules, the effects of IL-1 on gene expression, functions of cell-bound and soluble IL-1 receptors, the importance of the IL-1R accessory protein, newly discovered signal transduction pathways, naturally occurring cytokines limiting IL-1 production or activity, the effects of blocking cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide, and the outcomes of IL-1 and IL-1 Ra in human trials. Special attention is paid to IL-1beta converting enzyme and programmed cell death. The roles of IL-1 in hematopoiesis, leukemia, atherosclerosis, and growth of solid tumors are also discussed.

Greek towns are characterised by substantial population mixing due to internal migration, whereas there is relative isolation in mountainous rural areas. Predetermined space (5 km) and time (1 year) limits were used on the basis of previous reports in order to define the clustering cell. There is highly significant evidence for clustering of childhood leukaemia in Greece as a whole, the observed number of pairs that are close in both spaces and time exceeding the expected number by 5.2% (P = 0.004). The excess is particularly evident for leukaemia cases in 0 to 4-year-old children, among whom the observed number of pairs that are close in both space and time exceeded the expected number by 9.4% (P = 0.004). There is no evidence of space-time clustering for leukaemia cases older than 5 years. The overall pattern is descriptively similar in urban and semiurban areas and is especially marked for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the childhood peak ages (2-4 years) with an excess of 19% (P = 0.0006). In the rural population there is evidence for clustering of cases belonging to older and broader age groups, a phenomenon compatible with a delay in the development of herd immunity against putative infectious aetiological agents. The findings of the present study provide support for the hypothesis that a substantial proportion of cases of childhood leukaemia may arise as a rare sequel to exposure to an agent or agents, most probably viral in nature.","['Petridou, E', 'Revinthi, K', 'Alexander, F E', 'Haidas, S', 'Koliouskas, D', 'Kosmidis, H', 'Piperopoulou, F', 'Tzortzatou, F', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Petridou E', 'Revinthi K', 'Alexander FE', 'Haidas S', 'Koliouskas D', 'Kosmidis H', 'Piperopoulou F', 'Tzortzatou F', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Rural Population', 'Urban Population', 'Virus Diseases/complications']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.245 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 May;73(10):1278-83. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.245.,,,,,PMC2074508,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Effects of IL-6 family cytokines and growth factors on TIMP-1 production were studied in human articular chondrocytes, grown as monolayer and cartilage explant culture. TIMP-1 protein levels in the cultured medium were measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay. TIMP-1 messenger RNA levels in the cultured chondrocytes were analyzed by Northern blotting. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the cultured medium. Cell proliferation of chondrocytes was determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. RESULTS: IL-6 family cytokines induced TIMP-1 expression in monolayer and explant culture, and the production of TIMP-1 was most stimulated by OSM. In contrast, OSM did not modulate the release of MMPs and cell proliferation.

At such a concentration, differentiation induction was found to be the most pronounced drug effect. During the 3-day drug incubation period, the viable cell number remained essentially constant, with approximately 48% of the cells demonstrating a mature phenotype with increased acid phosphatase activity and nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction. As observed with other DNA-specific agents, induction of ML-1 differentiation by meisoindigo was accompanied by the down-regulation of c-myb gene expression.

DTAHQ (> or = 3 microM) showed effects similar to those of DTBHQ (10 microM) on [Ca2+]i elevation, induction of degranulation with TPA, and increase of antigen-induced degranulation. BHT (50 microM) and DTBHA (50 microM) caused [Ca2+]i elevation and increased degranulation in the presence of TPA or antigen, but their effects were less than those of DTBHQ and DTAHQ. MTBHQ and MTBHA had no effect on [Ca2+]i and degranulation, even at 50 microM. The degree of Ca2+ response caused by the compounds correlated well with the increase in degranulation, but not with their antioxidant activity estimated with the first oxidation potential. From these results, it is suggested that the increasing effects of six antioxidants on degranulation in the presence of TPA or antigen were dependent on [Ca2+]i increase caused by the compounds, probably through their ability to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.","['Akasaka, R', 'Teshima, R', 'Kitajima, S', 'Momma, J', 'Inoue, T', 'Kurokawa, Y', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Sawada, J']","['Akasaka R', 'Teshima R', 'Kitajima S', 'Momma J', 'Inoue T', 'Kurokawa Y', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Sawada J']","['Division of Biochemistry and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/14 00:00,1996/06/14 00:01,['1996/06/14 00:00'],"['1996/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006295296000925 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00092-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Jun 14;51(11):1513-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00092-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These dyes were synthesized with N-alkyl groups of different sizes (ethyl to octadecyl) to vary their lipophilic properties without compromising their photophysics. While dyes with smaller N-alkyl groups (ethyl to decyl) were already cytotoxic in the dark, longer chain cyanines exhibited antineoplastic activity only after exposure to light. Results from this study indicate that the switch from dark cytotoxicity to phototoxicity occurred when dyes, due to a decrease in cationic character with increasing size of alkyl substituents, were no longer able to cross the plasma membrane. Dark cytotoxicity decreased with increasing size of N-alkyl groups and was cell-line independent. On the other hand, photodynamic damage varied by several orders of magnitude depending on the cell line and the length of the alkyl substituents. The most effective photosensitizer was the dioctadecyl dye which achieved a 4- to 5-log reduction of leukemia cells, although it had very modest triplet and singlet oxygen quantum yields of 0.008 and 0.006, respectively. This study also showed that photobiological performance can be improved greatly by optimizing dye binding properties via structural modifications.","['Krieg, M', 'Bilitz, J M']","['Krieg M', 'Bilitz JM']","['Department of Pediatrics, MACC Fund Research Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'PK8M3ENX8C (parinaric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Carbocyanines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Photochemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/14 00:00,1996/06/14 00:01,['1996/06/14 00:00'],"['1996/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00087-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00087-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Jun 14;51(11):1461-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00087-1.,,,,['CA50733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of vanadate (10 microM ), accumulation of cells in G1 phase appeared after shorter times of incubation (48 h) with BuONa. A substantial increase in the proportion of cells with degraded DNA characteristic of apoptosis was observed after 48- to 72-h incubation with BuONa in the presence of vanadate. BuONa-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins pp37 and pp97. Our results raised the possibility that regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp37 and pp97 is an important event that heralds the BuONa-induced apoptosis.","['Chang, S T', 'Yung, B Y']","['Chang ST', 'Yung BY']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang Ming University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1996/04/25 00:00,1996/04/25 00:01,['1996/04/25 00:00'],"['1996/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)90641-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0641 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Apr 25;221(3):594-601. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0641.,,,,['DOH84-HR-411/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a chronic myelopathy known both as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM). The known modes of HTLV-I transmission are by sexual intercourse, from mother to child in breast milk, via blood transfusion, and by sharing of needles by parenteral drug users. In the present study we examined the presence of HTLV-I provirus genomic DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by DNA hybridization in mouthwash samples obtained from 13 Mashhadi-born Iranian Jews with spastic paraparesis associated with HTLV-I, 4 Mashhadi-born Iranian Jews asymptomatic carriers for HTLV-I and 21 healthy controls. Proviral HTLV-I DNA was detected by mouthwash PCR in 12 of 17 HTLV-I infected subjects (71%) but in none of 21 controls. Proviral DNA was also detected in mouthwash samples using HTLV-I probe by dot blot hybridization assay. The presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in whole saliva may suggest a possible transmission of the virus via saliva and explain the increased rate of infection in elderly Mashhadi-Jewish population.","['Achiron, A', 'Pinhas-Hamiel, O', 'Barak, Y', 'Doll, L', 'Offen, D', 'Djaldetti, R', 'Frankel, G', 'Shohat, B']","['Achiron A', 'Pinhas-Hamiel O', 'Barak Y', 'Doll L', 'Offen D', 'Djaldetti R', 'Frankel G', 'Shohat B']","['Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Iran/ethnology', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Male', 'Milk, Human/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mouth/*virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/transmission/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01718595 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1996;141(1):147-53. doi: 10.1007/BF01718595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to investigate cytokine production by human monocytic cells exposed to beryllium in vitro. The results indicated that such cells respond to beryllium ions in the presence of fluoride by accumulation of messenger ribonucleic acid for both tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta.

Methotrexate osteopathy was first reported in children with leukemia treated with high doses of methotrexate. In animal studies, low doses of methotrexate proved to have an adverse effect on bone metabolism, especially on osteoblast activity. OBSERVATIONS: Methotrexate osteopathy is a relatively unknown complication of low-dose methotrexate treatment. We describe three patients treated with low-dose oral methotrexate in whom signs and symptoms were present that were similar to those found in children treated with high doses of methotrexate. All three patients had a triad of severe pain localized in the distal tibiae, osteoporosis, and compression fractures of the distal tibia, which could be identified with radiographs, technetium Tc 99m scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate osteopathy can occur in patients treated with low doses of methotrexate, even over a short period of time. As pain is localized in the distal tibia, it is easily misdiagnosed as psoriatic arthritis of the ankle, but the diagnosis can be correctly made by careful investigation and use of imaging techniques. The only therapy is withdrawal of methotrexate. It is important that more physicians become aware of this side effect of methotrexate therapy, which can occur along with arthritic symptoms.","['Zonneveld, I M', 'Bakker, W K', 'Dijkstra, P F', 'Bos, J D', 'van Soesbergen, R M', 'Dinant, H J']","['Zonneveld IM', 'Bakker WK', 'Dijkstra PF', 'Bos JD', 'van Soesbergen RM', 'Dinant HJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Fractures, Stress/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis/chemically induced', 'Psoriasis/*drug therapy', 'Radiography']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1996 Feb;132(2):184-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-six patients were referred to the cytology clinic for FNAB as the initial screening test. In the majority of fresh cases, leukemia was not the first possibility considered, and FNAB played an important diagnostic role. No gross discrepancy was noted in any of the cases.

The incidence is around 2/100,000/year, the median age at diagnosis about 47 years. The course of CML is characterized by a chronic phase with few symptoms and good therapeutic response of about 4 to 5 years duration and by transition to a prognostically unfavourable blast phase of about 3 months duration. Therapy of choice, at present, is early allogenous bone marrow transplantation [BMT], which is curative in 40 to 80% of transplanted cases. In patients below 55 years, a donor search should be started at the earliest possible time after diagnosis. Drug therapy of choice are interferon alpha [IFN] and hydroxyurea, which are both superior to busulfan with regard to duration of chronic phase and survival. Complete cytogenetic remissions are observed in 5 to 9% of IFN-treated patients in randomized studies, but virtually all remain positive for bcr/abl by PCR. Whether and in how far IFN is superior to hydroxyurea appears, at least in part, to depend on the treatment intensity with hydroxyurea and on patients characteristics. In analyzing median survival times, the risk profiles of the patients have to be considered. In the future, intensive chemotherapy with or without autografting might play an important role in the therapy of chronic-phase CML. Forthcoming trials have to consider both, conventional and new experimental treatment modalities. An example is the treatment strategy of the ongoing randomized study of the German CML Study Group which compares allogenous BMT with the best available drug therapy and, in addition, analyses the influence of intensified drug therapy on survival.","['Hehlmann, R']",['Hehlmann R'],"['III.

Cells from different sources [bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood] and from different donor types [autologous, syngeneic or allogeneic] are used for transplantation. The aim of autologous transplantation is to apply intensive high-dose chemo-radiotherapy and to shorten the duration of aplasia. Allogeneic cells, in addition, are free of potentially contaminating precursor cells and provide a graft-versus-leukemia effect. For all patients, transplantation should be considered at diagnosis as an integral part of treatment strategy and, depending on risk factors, be performed early in the course of disease. Preferred time for patients with high-risk acute leukemias is first complete remission, second complete remission for standard or low-risk acute leukemias. For chronic myeloid leukemia, allogeneic transplantation should be performed within one year of diagnosis, preferably still in first chronic phase. Autologous transplantation can be considered in a protocol setting. For patients with myelodysplastic syndromes of the FAB subtype refractory anemia or refractory anemia with sideroblasts, allogeneic transplantation is the treatment of choice as initial therapy. For patients with refractory anemia and excess of blasts with or without transformation, remission induction should be attempted before transplantation. Autologous transplantation is the preferred treatment strategy for patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, for high-risk patients in first complete remission, for other patients in chemotherapy-sensitive first relapse. For patients with myeloma, transplantation should be considered after first line therapy. Age is the main individual patient's risk factor, transplant-related mortality immediately increases in parallel to increasing age. Autologous transplants are limited to patients below 60 to 65 years, allogeneic HLA-identical sibling transplants to patients below 50 to 55 years, and unrelated transplants to patients below 40 to 45 years. Prerequisites for transplant are availability of a donor, access to a transplant bed, informed consent of patient and donor, as well as financial guarantee.

The diagnosis is made by bone marrow or lymph node histology, while laboratory tests are relatively unspecific and may only hint towards the diagnosis. In contrast to high-grade malignant lymphoma, low-grade malignant NHL is often associated with the appearance of malignant lymphoma cells in peripheral blood. These malignant lymphocytes may be differentiated microscopically from normal lymphocytes, so that the diagnosis of NHL may be suspected not only because of clinical symptoms or lymphocytosis, which may present late in the natural history of the disease, but also on morphological grounds. Three types of low-grade malignant NHL cells may be recognized in peripheral blood: A mature appearing lymphocytic type with only slight alterations of the nucleus, a lymphoplasmocytic type, and a lymphocytic type with prominent alterations of the nucleus. The appearance of smudge cells and a monotony in lymphocyte morphology may serve as further diagnostic aids. Once the diagnosis has been suspected on morphological grounds, it may be verified in the case of B-cell lymphomas by flow cytometry. The clonality of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in addition has to be proven by demonstrating a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor in Southern blots. An early diagnosis of low-grade malignant NHL may not only provide new insights into the natural history of monoclonal cytopathies but may also be of importance in the clinical management of patients.","['Schleiffenbaum, B', 'Fehr, J']","['Schleiffenbaum B', 'Fehr J']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Departement fur Innere Medizin, Universitatsspital Zurich.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

In acute myelogenous leukemia [AML], this is due to the application of intensive induction therapies, comprising an anthracycline and a cytarabine. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], the introduction of intensive early consolidation and CNS prophylaxis played an additional important role. These myeloablative treatments became feasible because of considerable improvements in the management of infectious and bleeding complications. The standard induction for AML further on remains the '3 + 7' schedule [daunorubicin 45 to 60 mg/m2/day x 3, I.V. and Ara-C 100 to 200 mg/m2/day x 7, 24-h infusion]. In ALL, prednisone, vincristine, L-asparaginase and an anthracyeline are the backbone of the induction therapy. Unfortunately, there has been less improvement for overall long-term survival, which is about 15 to 20% in AML and 20 to 35% in ALL beyond 5 years. More intensive post-remission regimens which include high-dose Ara-C in AML and intermediate-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide in ALL seem to improve these results to some extent. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has the most powerful anti-leukemic potential; however, because of the high peritransplant mortality [20 to 25%], its use in first CR tends to be restricted to patients with adverse prognostic features predicting early relapse, while good-risk patients are transplanted at the first signs of relapse or in second CR.

In the salvage setting, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid have proved to be effective against MBC as well. Recent preclinical data suggest that paclitaxel plus 5-FU has additive cytotoxicity. Given these observations, we initiated a phase II trial in which 38 women with MBC have been treated with a combination of all three drugs. All patients are currently evaluable for toxicity and 34 are evaluable for response. All women had histologically proven and assessable disease. Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel were ineligible. Patient characteristics include a median age of 51 years (age range, 31 to 73 years) and a median performance status of 1 (range, 0 to 2). Thirty-three patients have received prior chemotherapy, of whom 23 had adjuvant chemotherapy only. Fifty-eight percent of the patients (22 of 38) had received prior doxorubicin or mitoxantrone; four patients had only hormonal therapy. Four patients had bone-only disease, and three patients had lymphangitic spread or cytologically positive pleural effusion as the only evaluable disease. Treatment consisted of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours (day 1 only), followed by folinic acid 300 mg over 1 hour, followed by 5-FU 350 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3. Patients received standard paclitaxel premedications. To date, 175 cycles have been administered (median cycle length, 29 days; median number of cycles per patient, five). Toxicities included grade 3/4 infections in nine cycles (5%), grade 3/4 mucositis in three cycles, grade 3/4 nausea/vomiting in three cycles, grade 1 paresthesias in 12 patients (32%), alopecia 100%, and 17 cycles (10%) associated with dose reduction. Based on Cancer and Leukemia Group B toxicity criteria, arthralgia/myalgias were modest and graded mild (32 cycles), moderate (nine cycles), or severe (two cycles). There were two major hypersensitivity reactions, prompting removal of those patients from further protocol treatment. Four patients are unassessable for response due to hypersensitivity reactions (two) and unevaluable disease (two). Among the 34 patients evaluable for response, there were three complete responses, 18 partial responses, one minor response, nine stable disease, and three progressive disease (response rate, 62%). Responses were seen in patients who had received prior doxorubicin or mitoxantrone (11 of 22 patients) and in anthracycline/naive patients (10 of 16 patients). Responses were observed in all metastatic sites: soft tissue, viscera, and bone. Paclitaxel/5-FU/folinic acid appears to be an effective and well-tolerated outpatient regimen for women with MBC, even after failure of anthracycline-containing therapy.","['Paul, D M', 'Garrett, A M', 'Meshad, M', 'DeVore, R D', 'Porter, L L', 'Johnson, D H']","['Paul DM', 'Garrett AM', 'Meshad M', 'DeVore RD', 'Porter LL', 'Johnson DH']","['The Vanderbilt Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1996 Feb;23(1 Suppl 1):48-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a transfected beta-globin gene is expressed in an inducible manner in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells while a transfected alpha-globin gene is constitutively expressed at a high level in induced and uninduced MEL cells. Interestingly, when the alpha-globin gene is transferred into MEL cells as part of human chromosome 16, it is appropriately expressed in an inducible manner. We explored the basis for the lack of erythroid-responsiveness of the proximal regulatory elements of the human alpha-globin gene. Since the alpha-globin gene is the only functional human globin gene that lacks CACCC and GATA-1 motifs, we asked whether their addition to the alpha-globin promoter would make the gene erythroid-responsive in MEL cells. The addition of each of these binding sites to the alpha-globin promoter separately did not result in inducibility in MEL cells. However, when both sites were added together, the alpha-globin gene became inducible in MEL cells. This suggests that erythroid non-responsiveness of the alpha-globin gene results from the lack of erythroid binding sites and is not necessarily a function of the constitutively active, GC rich promoter.","['Ren, S', 'Li, J', 'Atweh, G F']","['Ren S', 'Li J', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['5g0531 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/24.2.342 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Jan 15;24(2):342-7. doi: 10.1093/nar/24.2.342.,,,,"['HL42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1-RR00071/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC145638,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty-eight cases were identified from the children's cancer registry and the relevant data collected from the hospital records. Overall survival and disease free survival in the two populations were compared. RESULTS: There was a significant difference for both outcomes between the two study populations, those treated prior to August 1986 having an actuarial survival of 53% and a disease free survival of 47% compared with 93% and 88% in those children treated after August 1986 (p=0.01 and 0.001 respectively). This was not explained by differences in sex, age, area of residence at diagnosis or disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: Increased intensity and duration of the induction and consolidation phase of treatment has significantly improved outcome for standard and high risk disease in children who have received the intensive phases of this treatment at a regional paediatric oncology centre. Outcome is not compromised if children receive the less intensive maintenance therapy close to their homes at the district or base hospital and close links are maintained with the regional unit.","['Bailey, S', 'Lewis, M']","['Bailey S', 'Lewis M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Wellington School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'New Zealand', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate']",1996/01/26 00:00,1996/01/26 00:01,['1996/01/26 00:00'],"['1996/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Z Med J. 1996 Jan 26;109(1014):9-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the progress achieved in its treatment, 20% of cases relapse and no longer respond to chemotherapy. The most common phenotype of ALL cells share surface antigens with very early precursors of B cells and are therefore believed to originate from this lineage. Characterization of the growth requirement of ALL cells indicated that they were dependent on various cytokines, suggesting paracrine and/or autocrine growth regulation. Because many cytokines induce tyrosine phosphorylation in lymphoid progenitor cells, and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation is commonly observed in B-lineage leukaemias, attempts have been made to develop protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) blockers of leukaemia cell growth. Here we show that leukaemic cells from patients in relapse have constitutively activated Jak-2 PTK. Inhibition of Jak-2 activity by a specific tyrosine kinase blocker, AG-490, selectively blocks leukaemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing programmed cell death, with no deleterious effect on normal haematopoiesis.","['Meydan, N', 'Grunberger, T', 'Dadi, H', 'Shahar, M', 'Arpaia, E', 'Lapidot, Z', 'Leeder, J S', 'Freedman, M', 'Cohen, A', 'Gazit, A', 'Levitzki, A', 'Roifman, C M']","['Meydan N', 'Grunberger T', 'Dadi H', 'Shahar M', 'Arpaia E', 'Lapidot Z', 'Leeder JS', 'Freedman M', 'Cohen A', 'Gazit A', 'Levitzki A', 'Roifman CM']","['Division of Immunology/Allergy, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrphostins']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/379645a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1996 Feb 15;379(6566):645-8. doi: 10.1038/379645a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of spi-1/PU.1 in the genesis of leukemia, we generated spi-1 transgenic mice. In one founder line the transgene was overexpressed as an unexpected-size transcript in various mouse tissues. Homozygous transgenic animals gave rise to live-born offspring, but 50% of the animals developed a multistep erythroleukemia within 1.5 to 6 months of birth whereas the remainder survived without evidence of disease. At the onset of the disease, mice became severely anemic. Their hematopoietic tissues were massively invaded with nontumorigenic proerythroblasts that express a high level of Spi-1 protein. These transgenic proerythroblasts are partially blocked in differentiation and strictly dependent on erythropoietin for their proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. A complete but transient regression of the disease was observed after erythrocyte transfusion, suggesting that the constitutive expression of spi-1 is related to the block of the differentiation of erythroid precursors. At relapse, erythropoietin-independent malignant proerythroblasts arose. Growth factor autonomy could be partially explained by the autocrine secretion of erythropoietin; however, other genetic events appear to be necessary to confer the full malignant phenotype. These results reveal that overexpression of spi-1 is essential for malignant erythropoiesis and does not alter other hematopoietic lineages.","['Moreau-Gachelin, F', 'Wendling, F', 'Molina, T', 'Denis, N', 'Titeux, M', 'Grimber, G', 'Briand, P', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Tavitian, A']","['Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Wendling F', 'Molina T', 'Denis N', 'Titeux M', 'Grimber G', 'Briand P', 'Vainchenker W', 'Tavitian A']","['INSERM U248, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Exons', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Homozygote', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Liver/cytology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Organ Specificity', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.5.2453 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 May;16(5):2453-63. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.5.2453.,,,,,PMC231234,,,,,,,,,,,,

LYL1 is expressed in many hematolymphoid cells, with the notable exceptions of thymocytes and T cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library constructed from B cells, we identified the E-box-binding proteins E12 and E47 as potential lymphoid dimerization partners for LYL1. The interaction of LYL1 with E2a proteins was further characterized in vitro and shown to require the HLH motifs of both proteins. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed that in T-ALL and other cell lines, endogenous LYL1 exists in a complex with E2a proteins. A preferred DNA-binding sequence, 5'-AACAGATG(T/g)T-3', for the LYL1-E2a heterodimer was determined by PCR-assisted site selection. Endogenous protein complexes containing both LYL1 and E2a bound this sequence in various LYL1-expressing cell lines and could distinguish between the LYL1 consensus and muE2 sites.

We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene. Tax alone was also inactive. However, expression of the reporter gene was induced by coexpression of Tax and CREB. This effect was stronger with the GAD-CREB fusion protein. Analysis of different CREB mutants with this genetic system indicated that the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues, which include the basic domain and the leucine zipper, are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by Tax. To identify cellular proteins binding to TRE-1 in a Tax-dependent manner, this strain was also used to screen a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD. Of five positive clones isolated from 0.75 x 10(6) yeast colonies, four were members of the CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) family: CREB, two isoforms of the cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), and ATF-1. Interestingly, these three proteins can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus form a particular subgroup within the CREB/ATF family. Expression of ATF-2 in S. cerevisiae did not activate TRE-1 in the presence of Tax. This shows that in a eukaryotic nucleus, Tax specifically interacts with the basic domain-leucine zipper region of ATF-1, CREB, and CREM. The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit. When fused to GAD, the C-terminal region of Ku was able to activate transcription via TRE-1 but this activation was not dependent on Tax.","['Bantignies, F', 'Rousset, R', 'Desbois, C', 'Jalinot, P']","['Bantignies F', 'Rousset R', 'Desbois C', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR49 CNRS/ENSL, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CYC1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/genetics', '*Cytochromes c', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.5.2174 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 May;16(5):2174-82. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.5.2174.,,,,,PMC231205,,,,,,,,,,,,

During normal T-cell activation, IkappaBalpha is rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26S proteasome, thus permitting the release of functional NF-kappaB. In contrast to its transient pattern of nuclear induction during an immune response, NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax transforming protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent rather than transient NF-kappaB response. In this report, we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha, Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism. Like IkappaBalpha, Tax-mediated breakdown of IkappaBbeta in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of IkappaBbeta at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region. Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 Tax for IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta at the protein level, Tax selectively stimulates NF-kappaB-directed transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene. Consequently, IkappaBbeta protein expression is chronically downregulated in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes. These findings with IkappaBbeta provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in Tax-expressing cells.","['McKinsey, T A', 'Brockman, J A', 'Scherer, D C', 'Al-Murrani, S W', 'Green, P L', 'Ballard, D W']","['McKinsey TA', 'Brockman JA', 'Scherer DC', 'Al-Murrani SW', 'Green PL', 'Ballard DW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Serine', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.5.2083 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 May;16(5):2083-90. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.5.2083.,,,,"['CA5958-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI33839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC231195,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein is expressed exclusively in the liver. The rare Leyden form of hemophilia B (inherited factor IX deficiency) results from point mutations in three proximal promoter elements that decrease factor IX expression. Recovery of expression occurs following puberty, with factor IX protein levels rising into the normal range. We have previously implicated the PAR domain D-site-binding protein (DBP) as well as an upstream element, site 5, as playing important roles in the phenotypic recovery of hemophilia B Leyden. Here we demonstrate that site 5 binds both the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPalpha) and the ubiquitous Ets factor GA-binding protein (GABPalpha/beta). Transactivation of the factor IX promoter by the PAR proteins DBP and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) is dependent on the binding of GABPalpha/beta to site 5, and coexpression of these two factors is required for optimal activation of this promoter. The binding of C/EBPalpha to site 5 also augments the activity of GABPalpha/beta. Analysis of the developmental regulation of site 5-binding proteins in rat liver has shown that C/EBPalpha and the GABPbeta subunit increase markedly in the 2 weeks after birth. These observations establish a functional association between the Ets factor GABPalpha/beta and C/EBPalpha and indicate that the two PAR proteins, DBP and HLF, may play complementary roles in factor IX activation. Given the developmental changes exhibited by these proteins, it is likely that they play a role in regulation of the normal factor IX promoter as well as promoters carrying hemophilia B Leyden mutations.","['Boccia, L M', 'Lillicrap, D', 'Newcombe, K', 'Mueller, C R']","['Boccia LM', 'Lillicrap D', 'Newcombe K', 'Mueller CR']","[""Department of Pathology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gabpb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Aging/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Factor IX/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Point Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.5.1929 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 May;16(5):1929-35. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.5.1929.,,,,,PMC231180,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the de novo synthesis of these pyrimidine nucleotides by N-(phosphon)-acetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) may enhance the cytotoxicity of Ara-C. We therefore studied the effect of PALA on Ara-C cytotoxicity and on Ara-CTP accumulation and incorporation into DNA on cell lines and patient samples. Fifty micromolar PALA increased the growth inhibitory effect of Ara-C in U937 cells several fold both with pre- and coincubation. Ara-C cytotoxicity was not potentiated by PALA in Hl60 cells. However, coincubation with PALA did not enhance Ara-CTP accumulation both in HL60 and U937 cells, nor affect Ara-C incorporation into DNA. Ara-C cytotoxicity to leukemic blast cells from 11 untreated patients with different types of leukemia was only modulated to a small extent by high PALA concentrations in only two cases. Ara-CTP accumulation in leukemic blast cells varied from non-detectable levels to 200 pmol/10(6) cells. Fifty micromolar PALA enhanced the accumulation of Ara-CTP significantly in only one patient with no apparent effect on UTP and CTP levels. Raising PALA to 500 microM decreased UTP and CTP levels to 50% but had no effect on Ara-CTP levels. In conclusion, modulation by PALA of Ara-C cytotoxicity and metabolism is limited in leukemic cells, both in culture and from patients. This suggests the possibility for selective modulation of other agents by PALA on non-hematological cells.","['Noordhuis, P', 'Kazemier, K M', 'Kasperrs, G J', 'Peters, G J']","['Noordhuis P', 'Kazemier KM', 'Kasperrs GJ', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695000712 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00071-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Feb;20(2):127-34. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00071-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explain the superior antileukemic effect of moflomycin and to disclose a possible structure-activity relationship, we investigated the three main mechanisms by which anthracyclines are though to exert their antitumor effect: DNA binding, free radical production and topoisomerase II inhibition. The DNA interaction was assessed both by DNA binding and DNA unwinding assays, free radical generation was studied by electron spin resonance, and topoisomerase II interaction by analysis of the stimulation of enzyme-induced DNA breaks. The results showed a higher free radical production and a greater stimulation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage by moflomycin than doxorubicin, associated with a lower DNA affinity. The different biochemical characteristics of moflomycin, particularly its interaction with topoisomerase II, are related to the structural modifications performed on the chromophore. These properties, associated with a higher stability of the molecule induced by the presence of an iodine atom on the sugar moiety, are probably responsible for the higher antileukemic activity of this compound.","['Andrivon, W', 'Saucier, J M', 'Auclair, C', 'Monneret, C', 'Florent, J C', 'Guillosson, J J', 'Nafziger, J']","['Andrivon W', 'Saucier JM', 'Auclair C', 'Monneret C', 'Florent JC', 'Guillosson JJ', 'Nafziger J']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '107430-03-5 (moflomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145212695001557 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00155-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Feb;20(2):119-26. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00155-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instability of these repeat sequences at multiple gentic loci may result from mismatch repair errors and occur in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and several other sporadic cancers, including chronic myelocytic leukemia as it progresses to blastic crisis. We investigated whether genetic instability occurred as myelodysplasia progressed to acute myelocytic leukemia. To this end, we studied microsatellite instability in 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These included five patients with refractory anemia (RA), three with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblast (RARS), nine with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and three with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). All of these patients transformed to acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) of various subtypes: three patients with M1, 11 with M2 and six patients with M4 (according to FAB classification). The DNA from both the MDS and AML phases of their disease was analyzed at 16 loci, and only four microsatellite instabilities were found in the 240 paired samples (1.6%) analyzed.

However, during treatment with standard differentiating doses of PMA (10 ng/ml), no difference between the two cell lines in cytostasis and differentiation was found. Downregulation of c-myc and upregulation of p21/Waf1 proteins showed the same time-course in both cell lines.

Significant downregulation of bcl-2 protein occurred only in parental HL60 cells. In HL60/ADR, despite rapid cessation of bcl-2 protein synthesis, almost no change in steady-state bcl-2 protein level was found. The lack of bcl-2 protein downregulation was a result of the prolonged half-life of this protein in HL60/ADR cells.

Molecular masses determined for the mature virion proteins MA, CA, NC, and PR agree closely with those predicted by currently accepted models for their structures. However, the data for p10 imply that only about 10% of the product has the predicted mass while the remainder is missing the C-terminal methionine residue. Molecular masses also were obtained for products generated by PR cleavage in vitro of a Gag precursor polyprotein expressed in Escherichia coli. The data confirm the predicted Gag cleavage sites for PR. Thus, carboxypeptidase activity appears to be responsible for generating the des-Met form of p10. The same activity may account for the small amount of the mature des-Met CA, as previously reported. Analysis of cleavage products generated in vitro also serves to define the PR processing site separating the p2a and p2b peptides, Asn-164-Cys-165. In conjunction with published characterizations of these two peptides processed from the segment of Gag between MA and p10, these data suggest trimming of p2b by an aminopeptidase.

However, the tax gene product of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is known to induce the persistent nuclear expression of various NF-kappaB/Rel factors, especially the c-Rel proto-oncoprotein, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tax induces the degradation Of IkappaBbeta, another NF-kappaB/Rel cytoplasmic inhibitor that differs from IkappaBalpha in signal responses. Unlike that observed with IkappaBalpha, the degradation Of IkappaBbeta is not associated with its rapid resynthesis, apparently because of the failure of Tax to stimulate IkappaBbeta gene transcription. Thus, expression of Tax in Jurkat T cells leads to the gradual depletion of IkappaBbeta, which is correlated with the induction of c-Rel-containing kappaB binding complexes. Remarkably, in the three HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines investigated, little or no detectable amount of IkappaBbeta was found. We further demonstrate that Tax is able to override the cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel by 1kappaBbeta in transiently transfected cells. Together, these studies suggest that Tax-mediated inactivation Of IkappaBbeta may play a role in the persistent nuclear expression of c-Rel induced by HTLV-I infection.","['Good, L', 'Sun, S C']","['Good L', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey Medical Center, 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.5.2730-2735.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 May;70(5):2730-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.5.2730-2735.1996.,,,,['R01 CA68471-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC190129,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that conformational rearrangements of envelope glycoproteins were not optimally triggered following binding, and to overcome these postbinding blocks, we have generated here a set of chimeric MoMLV-derived envelopes targeted to the Ram-1 phosphate transporter in which we have varied the spacing between the Ram-1-binding domain and the MoMLV SU. All of the recombinant envelopes were correctly expressed on virions, and all bound efficiently to Ram-1.

Mutations in the other charged amino acids in this domain (R-83, E-86, and E-87) yield titers similar to those of wild-type envelope, but the affinity of the mutant envelope in the binding assay is decreased by nonconservative substitutions in parallel to the severity of the change. These other amino acids may either provide secondary receptor contacts or assist in maintaining a structure in the domain that favors efficient binding. We also studied other regions of high hydrophilicity. Our initial characterization indicates that amino acids 106 to 111 and 170 to 188 do not play a major role in receptor binding. Measurements of relative binding affinity and titer indicate that most mutations in the region of amino acids 120 to 131 did not significantly affect receptor binding. However, SU encoded by mutants H123V, R124L, and C131A as well as C81A could not be detected in particles and therefore did not bind measurably. Therefore, the region encompassed by amino acids 81 to 88 appears to be directly involved in receptor binding.","['MacKrell, A J', 'Soong, N W', 'Curtis, C M', 'Anderson, W F']","['MacKrell AJ', 'Soong NW', 'Curtis CM', 'Anderson WF']","['Gene therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Cancer, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.3.1768-1774.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Mar;70(3):1768-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.3.1768-1774.1996.,,,,,PMC190002,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 300 cases in this ""high-lymphoma stock"" have been registered since 1967. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-related virus was implicated as the etiologic agent of Sukhumi baboon lymphoma. The origin of this virus remained unclear. Two possibilities were originally considered: the origin could be baboon simian T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (STLV-1) or HTLV-1 (before the outbreak started, some Sukhumi baboons were inoculated with human leukemic material). The third possibility entered recently: interspecies transmission of rhesus macaque STLV-1 to baboons. It was prompted by the finding of very close similarity between STLV-1 991-1cc (the strain isolated from a non-Sukhumi baboon inoculated with material from a Sukhumi lymphomatous baboon) and rhesus STLV-1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated 37 Sukhumi STLV-1 isolates from baboons of high-lymphoma stock by PCR discriminating rhesus type and baboon type STLV-1 isolates. All of them were proved to be rhesus type STLV-1. In contrast, all six STLV-1 isolates from baboons belonging to other stocks or populations were of baboon type. The PCR results were fully confirmed by DNA sequence data. The partial env gene gene sequences of all four STLV-1 isolates from Sukhumi lymphomatous baboons were 97 to 100% similar to the sequence of known rhesus STLV-1 and only 85% homologous with the sequence of conventional baboon STLV-1. Thus, interspecies transmission of STLV-1 from rhesus macaques (or closely related species) to baboons occurred at Sukhumi Primate Center. Most probably this event initiated the outbreak of lymphoma in Sukhumi baboons.","['Voevodin, A', 'Samilchuk, E', 'Schatzl, H', 'Boeri, E', 'Franchini, G']","['Voevodin A', 'Samilchuk E', 'Schatzl H', 'Boeri E', 'Franchini G']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait. voevodin@hscc.kuniv.edu.kw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Disease Outbreaks/veterinary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology', '*Macaca mulatta', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monkey Diseases/transmission/*virology', '*Papio', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Species Specificity']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.3.1633-1639.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Mar;70(3):1633-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.3.1633-1639.1996.,,,,,PMC189987,,"['GENBANK/L42214', 'GENBANK/L42215', 'GENBANK/L42216', 'GENBANK/L42217', 'GENBANK/L42250', 'GENBANK/L42251']",,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, defective retroviruses that bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been found, and morphologically these appear to contain uncleaved Gag proteins. From this, it has been proposed that activation of PR may depend upon a host factor found only at the plasma membrane. However, if Gag proteins were cleaved by PR before the particle could pinch off the ER membrane, then the only particles that would remain visible are those that packaged smaller-than-normal amounts of PR, and these would have an immature morphology. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we made use of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag protein, the PR of RSV IS included on each Gag molecule. To target Gag to the ER, a signal peptide was installed at its amino terminus in place of the plasma membrane-binding domain. An intervening, hydrophobic, transmembrane anchor was included to keep Gag extended into the cytoplasm. We found that PR-mediated processing occurred, although the cleavage products were rapidly degraded. When the anchor was removed, allowing the entire protein to be inserted into the lumen of the ER, Gag processing occurred with a high level of efficiency, and the cleavage products were quite stable. Thus, PR activation does not require targeting of Gag molecules to the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, molecules lacking the transmembrane anchor were rapidly secreted from the cell in a nonmembrane-enclosed form and in a manner that was very sensitive to brefeldin A and monensin. In contrast, the wild-type RSV and Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag proteins were completely insensitive to these inhibitors, suggesting that the normal mechanism of transport to the plasma membrane does not require interactions with the secretory pathway.","['Krishna, N K', 'Weldon, R A Jr', 'Wills, J W']","['Krishna NK', 'Weldon RA Jr', 'Wills JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Rous sarcoma virus protease)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.3.1570-1579.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Mar;70(3):1570-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.3.1570-1579.1996.,,,,['CA47482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC189979,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the heterogeneity of this family of viruses, we have characterized the HTLV-2 subtypes present in several urban areas in Brazil. DNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large number of infected individuals, the majority of whom were intravenous drug abusers, were analyzed by using PCR with restriction fragment length polymorphism and nucleotide sequencing analysis. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the env region suggested that all individuals were infected with the HTLV-2a subtype, and this was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. In contrast, nucleotide sequence analysis of the long terminal repeat demonstrated that although the viruses were more related to the HTLV-2a than to the HTLV-2b subtype, they clustered in a distinct phylogenetic group, suggesting that they may represent a new and distinct molecular subtype of HTLV-2. This conclusion was supported by nucleotide sequence analysis of the pX region, which demonstrated that the Tax proteins of the Brazilian viruses differed from that of prototype HTLV-2a isolates but were more similar to that of HTLV-2b in that they would be expected to have an additional 25 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. In transient expression assays, the extended Tax protein of the prototype HTLV-2a subtype.

The efficiency of transduction of the neo marker of all mutated constructs was found to decrease by 5 to 6 orders of magnitude compared with that of the wild-type vector. Thirty-two of 60 transduced proviruses analyzed harbored a primer binding site sequence matching a glutamine tRNA primer. Sequence analysis of the regions flanking the glutamine tRNA primer binding site revealed a distinct pattern of nucleotide differences from the Akv-based vector, suggesting the involvement of a specific endogenous virus-like sequence in patch repair rescue of the primer binding site mutants. The putative recombination partner RNA was found in virions from psi-2 cells as detected by analysis of glutamine tRNA-initiated cDNA and by sequence analysis of regions at or around the glutamine tRNA primer binding site. We propose that the forced recombination of primer binding site mutants involves initial priming on endogenous viral sequences and requires template switching during minus-strand synthesis in the region between the neo gene and the mutated primer binding site to allow correct second-strand transfer in reverse transcription. The system thereby selects for a reverse transcriptase-mediated recombination event in the 5' untranslated region. A panel of sequence differences between the recombination partners in this region has allowed mapping of the site of recombination for each transduction event. Interestingly, the majority of the recombination events were clustered within a narrow, 33-nucleotide region though to be involved in genomic RNA dimerization.","['Mikkelsen, J G', 'Lund, A H', 'Kristensen, K D', 'Duch, M', 'Sorensen, M S', 'Jorgensen, P', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Mikkelsen JG', 'Lund AH', 'Kristensen KD', 'Duch M', 'Sorensen MS', 'Jorgensen P', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Virion']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.3.1439-1447.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Mar;70(3):1439-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.3.1439-1447.1996.,,,,,PMC189964,,['GENBANK/AF041383'],,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,661-7,"BACKGROUND: The possible link between psychological factors and length of cancer survival has generated a literature of contradictory findings. Associations usually have not been found when general psychological symptoms are assessed. Associations usually have been found for predictors related to expressive versus repressive emotional coping (e.g., depression, ""fighting spirit,"" hostility, and type C personality); however, even these associations have been relatively small, when compared with those for medical factors. Yet few studies have adequately controlled for medical and treatment-related factors. PURPOSE: Within a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) national clinical trial of four adjuvant therapy regimens for stage II breast cancer (CALGB 8082), this study prospectively examined the contribution of potential psychological predictors to length of disease-free and overall survival over a 15-year period. METHODS: Subjects were 280 women with stage II breast cancer, out of a total of 899, who were randomly assigned to receive CMFVP (cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil-vincristine-prednisone) for two 6-week cycles or six 4-week cycles, then subsequently randomly assigned to receive or not to receive VATH (vinblastine-doxorubicin-thiotepa-fluoxymesterone). Subjects were recruited during the period between October 1980 and August 1984, inclusive, and followed until January 1996. Prior to chemotherapy, psychological symptoms were assessed using the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). SCL-90-R scores were trichotomized into categories representing high, medium, and low distress. Basic base-line sociodemographic data (including age, ethnicity, education, and marital status) and medical data (including lymph node status, estrogen receptor status, menopausal status, and performance status) were collected. Subjects with psychosocial data differed from those without psychosocial data solely in their higher percentage of classification in the mild limitation category of the Zubrod (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status rating (subjects with psychosocial data: 14%; subjects without psychosocial data: 8%). RESULTS: In stepwise Cox regression analyses that controlled for sociodemographic and medical variables, there was no significant predictive effect of the level of distress (as measured by the SCL-90-R trichotomized scores) on length of disease-free and overall survival of the study subjects. Risk ratios for low versus high distress were 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-1.66) for disease-free survival and 1.03 (95% CI = 0.58-1.82) for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to provide evidence that psychological factors contributed to length of disease-free or overall survival of women who received adjuvant chemotherapy (either CMFVP alone or CMFVP followed by VATH) for treatment of stage II breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS: In the context of far more potent medical factors, the contribution of psychological factors to disease-free and overall survival is likely to be relatively small. Future research should focus on specific theory-driven predictors rather than on general psychological symptoms. Moreover, it should be based on clinical studies using a controlled, prospective design, in which the effects of medical factors may be distinguished and psychological predictors are clear antecedents of survival outcomes.","['Tross, S', 'Herndon, J 2nd', 'Korzun, A', 'Kornblith, A B', 'Cella, D F', 'Holland, J F', 'Raich, P', 'Johnson, A', 'Kiang, D T', 'Perloff, M', 'Norton, L', 'Wood, W', 'Holland, J C']","['Tross S', 'Herndon J 2nd', 'Korzun A', 'Kornblith AB', 'Cella DF', 'Holland JF', 'Raich P', 'Johnson A', 'Kiang DT', 'Perloff M', 'Norton L', 'Wood W', 'Holland JC']","['New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York City 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/*psychology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk', '*Stress, Psychological', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.10.661 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 May 15;88(10):661-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.10.661.,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 May 15;88(10):629-31.

These include AZT 5'-diphosphate-rac-1-S-octadecyl-2-O-palmitoyl-1-thioglycerol (1), 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine 5'-diphosphate-rac-1-S-octadecyl-2-O-palmitoyl-1-thioglycerol (2) 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate-rac-1-S-octadecyl-2-O-palmitoyl-1-thioglycerol (3), and AZT 5'-diphosphate-rac-1-O-tetradecyl-2-O-palmitoylglycerol (4). The conjugates form micelles by sonication (mean diameters ranging 6.8-55.5 nm). Conjugate 1 protected 80% of HIV-infected CEM cells as low as 0.58 microM and lost the protection at 180 microM due to prevailing cytotoxicity, while the conjugate started to show the cytotoxicity at 100 microM. Pharmacokinetics studies showed a significant increase of half-life values (t1/2) of AZT and AZddU2 (respective t1/2 = 5.69 and 6.5 h) after administration of conjugates 1 and 2, while those after administration of AZT and AZddU were 0.28 and 0.89 h, respectively. The fractions of the prodrugs 1 and 2 converted to the parent compounds AZT and AZddU were 36% and 55%, respectively. The results indicate that AZT and AZddU thioether lipid conjugates 1 and 2 warrant further investigation.","['Hong, C I', 'Nechaev, A', 'Kirisits, A J', 'Vig, R', 'West, C R', 'Manouilov, K K', 'Chu, C K']","['Hong CI', 'Nechaev A', 'Kirisits AJ', 'Vig R', 'West CR', 'Manouilov KK', 'Chu CK']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Ethers', 'Female', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phospholipids/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/26 00:00,1996/04/26 00:01,['1996/04/26 00:00'],"['1996/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm950620o [doi]', 'jm950620o [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Apr 26;39(9):1771-7. doi: 10.1021/jm950620o.,,,,"['AI-25899/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-27697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A platelet type TXA2 receptor from the megakaryocyte-like HEL cell was cloned with a deduced amino acid sequenced identical to that previously reported for the human placental TXA2 receptor. Transient expression of the HEL cell TXA2 receptor cDNA and radioligand binding studies with the agonist 125I-BOP showed a single class of binding sites with an affinity comparable to a low affinity platelet TXA2 receptor. Using a series of 13-azapinane TXA2 analogs, which discriminate between TXA2 receptor subtypes in platelets and vascular smooth muscle, we found that the cloned HEL cell TXA2 receptor is characteristic of a platelet type TXA2 receptor and that its binding characteristics are different from those of vascular smooth muscle cells. The affinity of the HEL cell TXA2 receptor for 125I-BOP was significantly (P < .05) increased upon co-transfection with G alpha 13 alone, or with G alpha q alone and with G alpha 13 and G alpha 12 together (n = 4-6). GTP gamma S significantly (P < .05) decreased the affinity of the receptor for 125I-BOP in COS-7 cell membranes coexpressing HEL-TXR and G alpha 13 to a value comparable to HEL-TXA2 receptor alone. We conclude that 1) the cloned HEL cell TXA2 receptor has pharmacological characteristics of a low affinity platelet type receptor and 2) that the affinity state of this receptor may be influenced by interaction with G alpha 13 and G alpha q.","['Allan, C J', 'Higashiura, K', 'Martin, M', 'Morinelli, T A', 'Kurtz, D T', 'Geoffroy, O', 'Meier, G P', 'Gettys, T W', 'Halushka, P V']","['Allan CJ', 'Higashiura K', 'Martin M', 'Morinelli TA', 'Kurtz DT', 'Geoffroy O', 'Meier GP', 'Gettys TW', 'Halushka PV']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane)', '124924-85-2', ""(7-(3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4'-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-yl)-5-"", 'heptenoic acid)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Thromboxane/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1996 May;277(2):1132-9.,,,,"['DK42486/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL077260/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36836/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both cytokine receptors contain gp130/interleukin-6-receptor transducer as well as gp190/low affinity LIF receptor. For CNTF, addition of a third subunit, or alpha subunit, defines the high-affinity CNTF receptor. In the present study, we analyzed the binding interactions of LIF and CNTF in human cell lines and showed a mutual displacement for LIF and CNTF toward the trimeric high-affinity CNTF receptor. Similar results were obtained in the JEG cell line, which only expressed the gp130/gp190 high-affinity LIF receptor, by adding a soluble form of the alpha CNTF receptor to the system to reconstitute the high-affinity-type CNTF receptor. The different receptor subunits were then expressed separately in transfected cells and their binding capacities analyzed. The results showed that the heterocomplex CNTF/alpha CNTF receptor bound to gp130 with an affinity of 3-5 x 10(-10)M, whereas LIF interacted mainly with gp190. In summary, the observed competition between LIF and CNTF does not result from the binding to a common site or receptor subunit, but rather to the interaction of the three receptor components to create a conformational site common to both LIF and CNTF.","['Robledo, O', 'Auguste, P', 'Coupey, L', 'Praloran, V', 'Chevalier, S', 'Pouplard, A', 'Gascan, H']","['Robledo O', 'Auguste P', 'Coupey L', 'Praloran V', 'Chevalier S', 'Pouplard A', 'Gascan H']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, CHU Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/physiology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Choriocarcinoma', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/ultrastructure']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66041391.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1996 Apr;66(4):1391-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66041391.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the role of intracellular NAD in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and ultraviolet (UV) light-induced activation of the 24-kD apoptotic protease (AP24) leading to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and death. Our results demonstrate that nutritional depletion of NAD to undetectable levels in two leukemia lines (U937 and HL-60) renders them completely resistant to apoptosis. This was attributed to a block in the activation of AP24 and subsequent DNA cleavage. Normal cells show an elevation of ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) in both the cytosol and nucleus after exposure to TNF, but before DNA fragmentation. ADPRT activity as well as cell death was suppressed by an inhibitor specific for mono-ADPRT. Nuclei from NAD-depleted cells were still sensitive to DNA fragmentation induced by exogenous AP24, indicating a selective function for NAD upstream of AP24 activation in the apoptotic pathway. We confirmed a requirement for intracellular NAD, activation of ADPRT, and subsequent NAD depletion during apoptosis in KG1a, YAC-1, and BW1547 leukemia cell lines. However, this mechanism is not universal, since BJAB and Jurkat leukemia cells underwent apoptosis normally, even in the absence of detectable intracellular NAD. We conclude that TNF or UV light-induced apoptotic cell death is not due to NAD depletion in some leukemia cell lines. Rather, NAD-dependent reactions which may involve mono-ADPRT, function in signal transduction leading to activation of AP24, with subsequent DNA fragmentation and cell death.","['Wright, S C', 'Wei, Q S', 'Kinder, D H', 'Larrick, J W']","['Wright SC', 'Wei QS', 'Kinder DH', 'Larrick JW']","['Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Iodobenzenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (AP24 apoptotic protease)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Iodobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NAD/*deficiency', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.183.2.463 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Feb 1;183(2):463-71. doi: 10.1084/jem.183.2.463.,,,,['CA-68223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2192452,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid molecular strategies, including detection of common CMV UL97 mutations and CMV DNA quantitation, can be used directly in leukocytes of immunocompromised subjects with CMV disease to monitor antiviral therapy.","['Boivin, G', 'Chou, S', 'Quirk, M R', 'Erice, A', 'Jordan, M C']","['Boivin G', 'Chou S', 'Quirk MR', 'Erice A', 'Jordan MC']","['Department of Microbiology, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/complications/drug therapy/virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications/*drug therapy/*virology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*blood/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukocytes/virology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viremia/complications/drug therapy/virology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/infdis/173.3.523 [doi]'],ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1996 Mar;173(3):523-8. doi: 10.1093/infdis/173.3.523.,,,,"['AI-30456/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-13083/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asthmatic patients with birch pollen allergy had lavages performed before and during the pollen season, and the chemotactic activity of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was tested against normal eosinophils. The activity was significantly increased during the pollen season as compared with the activity before the pollen season (p less than 0.01). Neutralizing antibodies to IL-2, IL-5 and IL-8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and to RANTES were added to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Antibodies to IL-5 and RANTES, but not to IL-2 and IL-8 or leukemia inhibitory factor, significantly inhibited the chemotactic activity for eosinophils (p less than 0.001).

A putative role in the mechanism of cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis.,4127-33,"One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells to kill target cells involves synergy between the pore-forming protein, perforin, and a serine protease termed granzyme B, both constituents of the cytoplasmic granules of cytolytic lymphocytes. Exposing susceptible cells to perforin and granzyme B results in apoptosis, the morphological consequences of which are most clearly seen in the nucleus. It is conventionally accepted that perforin acts by perforating the target cell membrane; however, the site and mode of action of granzyme B are unknown. We have addressed this issue using Western blotting, proteolytic assays, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to demonstrate that purified human granzyme B can be taken up in large amounts and bound within nuclei. By contrast, perforin and nongranzyme serine proteases did not undergo nuclear uptake. Both unglycosylated human granzyme B (26 kDa) and that bearing high mannose glycosylation (32 kDa) were internalized and bound within nuclei, but forms greater than 32 kDa with complex carbohydrate addition were excluded. The uptake of granzymes was not dependent on net charge, as nuclei absorbed similar quantities of granzyme B at neutral pH and through a range of basic pHs but did not take up other very basic serine proteases such as the mouse mast cell protease 5. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated nuclear and nucleolar accumulation of fluoresceinated granzyme B by isolated nuclei. Measurement of the kinetics of nuclear import using an in vitro nuclear transport assay indicated maximal levels of nuclear accumulation of granzyme about 2.5-fold above those in the cytoplasm and nucleolar accumulation a further 3-4-fold higher. Nuclear and nucleolar accumulation were exceedingly rapid, reaching half-maximal levels within 3.3 and 7.5 min, respectively, implying that nuclear accumulation probably occurs prior to transport to the nucleolus. Our observations may provide a mechanism explaining how aspartate-specific cell death proteases access the nuclear substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the cleavage of which is an early event in apoptosis.","['Trapani, J A', 'Browne, K A', 'Smyth, M J', 'Jans, D A']","['Trapani JA', 'Browne KA', 'Smyth MJ', 'Jans DA']","['Cellular Cytotoxicity Laboratory, The Austin Research Institute, Studley Road, Heidelberg, 3084, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology/ultrastructure', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Granzymes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/23 00:00,1996/02/23 00:01,['1996/02/23 00:00'],"['1996/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.8.4127 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)36477-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Feb 23;271(8):4127-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.8.4127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we investigated the roles of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Accompanying the RA-induced differentiation, activities of src family PTKs Lyn and Fgr became detected and reached a plateau 2 days after the stimulation. The immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) showed that the proteins of 56 and 53 kDa were predominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated at day 2. Adsorption and immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate by specific antibodies evidenced that these phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are Lyn and Fgr PTKs. The degree of both activities and tyrosine phosphorylation of these PTKs was reduced to be minimal at day 5 when the HL-60 cells start to die by apoptosis. The inhibitors of PTKs, herbimycin A and genistein, were demonstrated to cause premature cell death of HL-60 cells in the presence of RA. The death was the consequence of an apoptotic process. The Ra-treated HL-60 cells, when incubated with specific c-lyn or c-fgr antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, also underwent premature death at day 2. These data implicate that Lyn and Fgr PTKs prevent programmed cell death to promote granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Katagiri, K', 'Yokoyama, K K', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Omura, S', 'Irie, S', 'Katagiri, T']","['Katagiri K', 'Yokoyama KK', 'Yamamoto T', 'Omura S', 'Irie S', 'Katagiri T']","['Institute of Biomatrix, Nippi Inc., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Thionucleotides', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification']",1996/05/10 00:00,1996/05/10 00:01,['1996/05/10 00:00'],"['1996/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.19.11557 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47026-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 10;271(19):11557-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.19.11557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R., Powers, R. W., and Larsen, W. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28282-28287). The purpose of this study is to determine whether ITI binding to tumor cell surface is mediated by urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI)-receptor or cell-associated hyaluronic acid (HA). We demonstrated specific complex formation of the heavy (H) chains of ITI with HA. Binding of the H-chains of ITI to immobilized HA was detected and quantified using colorimetric immunoassays. Binding was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent. However, UTI and HI-8 (the carboxyl terminus of UTI) failed to bind to immobilized HA. ITI bound to HA remained functional protease inhibiting activity. After incubation of SMT-cc1 cells with purified biotinylated ITI, biotinylated ITI is bound to the cells, dissociated, and gives rise to the H-chains and UTI on the cell surface. The cell surface receptor-bound UTI derived from ITI may be the result of the limited proteolysis on the cell surface. In the cells treated with hyaluronidase, bound H-chains disappeared from the surface of the cells, while most of the cell surface ITI derivatives was present in deglycosylated UTI (28 kDa). It is suggested that the binding of ITI to the cell surface is mediated by HA on the cells. This was confirmed by the fact that the hyaluronidase-treated cells can abolish the ITI binding. The cell surface UTI formation was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and eglin C, suggesting that elastase-like enzyme(s) may be responsible for the UTI formation. Preincubation of the cells with UTI did not decrease in exogenously added ITI on the cell surface. A model for cell surface UTI formation is proposed in which ITI binding to cells from serum used for the culture is followed by the limited proteolysis by trace amounts of active serine proteases, to form cell-surface receptor-bound UTI and the H-chains intercalated into cell surface HA. This process is subject to regulation of cell-associated UTI and of stabilization of pericellular matrix.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Gotoh, J', 'Hirashima, Y', 'Terao, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Gotoh J', 'Hirashima Y', 'Terao T']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alpha-Globulins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (urinary trypsin inhibitor receptor)', '39346-44-6 (inter-alpha-inhibitor)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)', 'OR3S9IF86U (urinastatin)']",IM,"['Alpha-Globulins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Choriocarcinoma', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*metabolism', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms']",1996/05/10 00:00,1996/05/10 00:01,['1996/05/10 00:00'],"['1996/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.19.11362 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)46999-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 10;271(19):11362-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.19.11362.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis by which Spi-1/PU.1 is involved in the erythroleukemic process remains to be elucidated.

Microsequence analysis revealed that this 55-kDa protein was p54nrb (nuclear RNA-binding protein, 54 kDa) a RNA-binding protein highly similar to the splicing factor PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor). In this paper, we show that Spi-1/PU.1 impedes the binding of p54nrb to RNA and alters the splicing process in vitro. Moreover, we present evidence that the transcriptional factor Spi-1/PU.1, unlike other Ets proteins, is able to bind RNA.

Evidence that sphingosine releases Ca2+ from inositol trisphosphate- and phosphatidic acid-sensitive intracellular stores through a mechanism independent of inositol trisphosphate.,11148-55,"Effects of sphingosine on Ca2+ mobilization in the human Jurkat T cell line were examined. Sphingosine increased the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of around 8 microM. Sphingosine and OKT3, a CD3 monoclonal antibody, transiently increased [Ca2+]i, which declined to the resting level in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under the same conditions, pretreatment with sphingosine inhibited but did not abolish an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the subsequent addition of OKT3 and vice versa. However, pretreatment with sphingosine did not affect an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by OKT3 in the presence of Ca2+. OKT3 increased IP3 formation, but sphingosine did not affect the level of IP3 by itself nor did it cause IP3 formation induced by OKT3. In permeabilized Jurkat cells, the addition of IP3 released Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial intracellular stores, but the addition of sphingosine did not. Sphingosine, stearylamine, and psychosine increased [Ca2+]i and diacylglycerol (DG) kinase activation; however, ceramide did not, whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate slightly activated DG kinase without elevation of [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment with R59022, a DG kinase inhibitor, abolished the peak but did not affect the sustained response to [Ca2+]i to sphingosine. Phosphatidic acid (PA) elevated [Ca2+]i, after which it declined to a resting level even in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In accordance with this, PA did not stimulate 45Ca2+ uptake into cells, but sphingosine and OKT3 did. Pretreatment with PA partially inhibited a rise in [Ca2+]i induced by the subsequent addition of sphingosine and vice versa in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under similar conditions, pretreatment with PA affected an elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by OKT3 less, after which the subsequent addition of sphingosine did not increase [Ca2+]i. In permeabilized Jurkat cells, the addition of IP3 did not release Ca2+, but PA did in the presence of heparin. Pretreatment with thapsigargin, a microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, abolished the rises of [Ca2+]i induced by the subsequent addition of sphingosine, OKT3, and PA in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The present results suggest that at least two kinds of intracellular Ca2+ stores exist in Jurkat cells, both of which are IP3- and PA-sensitive, and that sphingosine mobilizes Ca2+ from both stores in an IP3-independent manner. Furthermore, the IP3- but not the PA-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store seems to regulate Ca2+ entry induced by sphingosine.","['Sakano, S', 'Takemura, H', 'Yamada, K', 'Imoto, K', 'Kaneko, M', 'Ohshika, H']","['Sakano S', 'Takemura H', 'Yamada K', 'Imoto K', 'Kaneko M', 'Ohshika H']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '2238-90-6 (Psychosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '93076-89-2 (R 59022)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'FFV58UNY7O (stearylamine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amines/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Models, Biological', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Psychosine/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/*pharmacology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/10 00:00,1996/05/10 00:01,['1996/05/10 00:00'],"['1996/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.19.11148 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)46969-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 10;271(19):11148-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.19.11148.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligand binding activity of these adhesion receptors is not constitutive and can be regulated by temperature, presence of extracellular divalent cations, stimulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and cellular activation. We have generated three novel mAbs, HUTS-4, HUTS-7, and HUTS-21, recognizing specific epitopes on the common beta 1 subunit (CD29) of VLA integrins whose expression correlates with the ligand binding activity of these heterodimeric glycoproteins. This correlation has been demonstrated for several integrin heterodimers in different cell systems using a variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli for integrin activation. Thus, the presence of micromolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+, preincubation with the activating anti-beta 1 mAb TS2/16, and cell treatment with phorbol esters or calcium ionophores, induced the expression of the HUTS beta 1 epitopes on T lymphoblasts. Using a panel of human-mouse beta 1 chimeric molecules, we have mapped these epitopes to the 355-425 sequence of the beta 1 polypeptide. This segment represents therefore a novel regulatory region of beta 1 that is exposed upon integrin activation. Interestingly, binding of HUTS mAbs to partially activated VLA integrins results in maximal activation of these adhesion receptors and enhancement of cell adhesion to beta 1 integrin ligands collagen, laminin, and fibronectin.","['Luque, A', 'Gomez, M', 'Puzon, W', 'Takada, Y', 'Sanchez-Madrid, F', 'Cabanas, C']","['Luque A', 'Gomez M', 'Puzon W', 'Takada Y', 'Sanchez-Madrid F', 'Cabanas C']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Ligands)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*chemistry/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Laminin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lung/immunology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/immunology', '*Protein Conformation', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/10 00:00,1996/05/10 00:01,['1996/05/10 00:00'],"['1996/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.19.11067 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)46958-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 10;271(19):11067-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.19.11067.,,,,"['GM 47157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 49899/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand how granzyme B is involved in mechanisms of target cell destruction, characterization and identification of substrates are required. We have developed an in situ binding assay using permeabilized cells and recombinant granzyme B that allows us to visualize potential substrates after immunostaining with anti-granzyme B antiserum. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunoelectron microscopic analyses demonstrate that granzyme B recognizes a nuclear substrate. The labeling pattern observed corresponds with regions of positive staining with uranyl acetate which binds to heterochromatin in the nucleus. Positive labeling of target cells with granzyme B is dependent on the presence of a catalytically active proteinase, since an inactive proenzyme form of granzyme B fails to give rise to any binding in the target cells. Far-Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of subcellular fractions of target cells have shown that the putative substrate of catalytically active granzyme B is an 80-kDa nuclear protein. Minor cytosolic bands of 50 and 94 kDa are also observed.

These are the inhibition of GDP dissociation, the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis, and the stimulation of the release of GTP-binding proteins from membranes. In order to better understand how GDI interactions with Rho-like proteins mediate these different effects, we have set out to develop a direct fluorescence spectroscopic assay for the binding of the GDI to the Rho-like protein, Cdc42Hs. We show here that when the GDI interacts with Cdc42Hs that contains bound N-methylanthraniloyl GDP (Mant-GDP), there is an approximately 20% quenching of the Mant fluorescence. The GDI-induced quenching is only observed when Mant-GDP is bound to Spodoptera frugiperda-expressed Cdc42Hs and is not detected when the Mant nucleotide is bound to Escherichia coli-expressed Cdc42Hs and thus shows the same requirement for isoprenylated GTP-binding protein as that observed when assaying GDI activity. A truncated Cdc42Hs mutant that lacks 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus and is insensitive to GDI regulation also does not show changes in the fluorescence of its bound Mant-GDP upon GDI addition. Thus, the GDI-induced quenching of Mant-GDP provides a direct read-out for the binding of the GDI to Cdc42Hs. Titration profiles of the GDI-induced quenching of the Mant-GDP fluorescence are saturable and are well fit to a simple 1:1 binding model for Cdc42Hs-GDI interactions with an apparent Kd value of 30 nM. A very similar Kd value (28 nM) is measured when titrating the GDI-induced quenching of the fluorescence of Mant-guanylyl imidotriphosphate, bound to Cdc42Hs. These results suggest that the GDI can bind to the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs equally well. We also have used the fluorescence assay for GDI interactions to demonstrate that the differences in functional potency observed between the GDI molecule and a related human leukemic protein, designated LD4, are due to differences in their binding affinities for Cdc42Hs. This, together with the results from studies using GDI/LD4 chimeras, allow us to conclude that a limit region within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the GDI molecule is responsible for its ability to bind with higher affinity (compared with LD4) to Cdc42Hs.","['Nomanbhoy, T K', 'Cerione, R']","['Nomanbhoy TK', 'Cerione R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGDIA protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (human leukemia protein LD4)', '0 (ortho-Aminobenzoates)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor alpha)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', ""127383-33-9 (3'-(methylanthraniloyl)-2'-deoxy-guanosine diphosphate)"", '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '34273-04-6 (Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*chemistry', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', '*Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/analogs & derivatives', 'Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor alpha', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",1996/04/26 00:00,1996/04/26 00:01,['1996/04/26 00:00'],"['1996/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.17.10004 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)31051-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 26;271(17):10004-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.17.10004.,,,,"['EY06429/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM47458/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chem. 269, 31685-31692). The present findings document the intrinsic ability of sphingoid bases to induce apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 cells. Exposure to either sphingosine or sphinganine (0. 001 10 microM) for 6 h promoted apoptotic degradation of genomic DNA as indicated by (a) electrophoretic resolution of 50-kilobase pair DNA loop fragments and 0.2-1.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment ladders on agarose gels, and (b) spectrofluorophotometric determination of the formation and release of double-stranded fragments and corresponding loss of integrity of bulk DNA. DNA damage correlated directly with reduced cloning efficiency and was associated with the appearance of apoptotic cytoarchitectural traits. At sublethal concentrations (</=750 nM), however, sphingoid bases synergistically augmented the apoptotic capacity of ceramide (10 microM), producing both a leftward shift in the ceramide concentration-response profile and a pronounced increase in the response to maximally effective levels of ceramide. Thus, sphingosine and sphinganine increased both the potency and efficacy of ceramide. The apoptotic capacity of bacterial sphingomyelinase (50 milliunits/ml) was similarly enhanced by either (a) acute co-exposure to highly selective pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase C such as calphostin C and chelerythrine or (b) chronic pre-exposure to the non-tumor-promoting protein kinase C activator bryostatin 1, which completely down-modulated total assayable protein kinase C activity. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of protein kinase C by physiological or pharmacological agents potentiates the lethal actions of ceramide in human leukemia cells, providing further support for the emerging concept of a cytoprotective function of the protein kinase C isoenzyme family in the regulation of leukemic cell survival.","['Jarvis, W D', 'Fornari, F A', 'Traylor, R S', 'Martin, H A', 'Kramer, L B', 'Erukulla, R K', 'Bittman, R', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Fornari FA', 'Traylor RS', 'Martin HA', 'Kramer LB', 'Erukulla RK', 'Bittman R', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, 23298-0230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ceramides/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Fumonisins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mycotoxins/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1996/04/05 00:00,1996/04/05 00:01,['1996/04/05 00:00'],"['1996/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.14.8275 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45639-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 5;271(14):8275-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.14.8275.,,,,"['CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NL-16660/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these results we conclude that the rectification properties of native inwardly rectifying potassium channels are largely controlled by intracellular spermine.","['Bianchi, L', 'Roy, M L', 'Taglialatela, M', 'Lundgren, D W', 'Brown, A M', 'Ficker, E']","['Bianchi L', 'Roy ML', 'Taglialatela M', 'Lundgren DW', 'Brown AM', 'Ficker E']","['Rammelkamp Center for Education and Research, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44109-1998, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '7GI49JB39O (MDL 73811)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.11.6114 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45510-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 15;271(11):6114-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.11.6114.,,,,"['NS23877/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS36930/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence rate of second primary cancer in a cohort of women with primary gynecological cancer and patient characteristics, namely age, diagnosis, type of treatment, and duration of follow-up. The study cohort comprised 925 Israeli Jewish women with histologically confirmed gynecologic malignancies. The file was linked by computer matching to the Israel Cancer Registry for identification of second primary cancers. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) for site-specific as well as for all cancer were computed. A significant excess for subsequent leukemia among ovarian (SIR 10; 95% CI 1.1-36.1) and uterine corporal cancer patients (SIR 10.0; 95% CI 2.7-25.6) was found. The significant increase in leukemia was treatment-related and limited to patients treated with radiotherapy. Age older than 60 years constituted a significantly unfavorable factor.

Notably, mast cells respond to C3a with the release of vasoactive substances, including histamine. We have examined the function and receptor binding of C3a in a human leukemic mast cell line, HMC-1. Similar to chemoattractant agonists in leukocytes, C3a induced rapid cytosolic free calcium concentration increases in HMC-1 cells. EGTA did not diminish this response, indicating that mobilizable Ca2+ was from intracellular stores. Receptors of C3a in HMC-1 cells couple in part to Bordetella pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and, therefore, appear to belong to the family of serpentine receptors that require G-proteins for signal transduction. HMC-1 cells express two types of C3a receptors, C3aR1 and C3aR2, that were shown to bind 125I-C3a with high-(Kd1 = 2.1-4.8 nM) or low-affinity (Kd2 = 30-150 nM), and both receptors are expressed at high level: 3 x 10(5)-6 x 10(5) C3aR1/cell and 5 x 10(5)-2.3 x 10(6) C3aR2/cell. Results from cross-linking experiments with 125I-C3a fully agree with the presence of two different classes of C3a receptors in HMC-1 cells. Two membrane proteins with apparent molecular masses of 54-61 kDa (p57) and 86-107 kDa (p97) could be covalently modified with 125I-C3a, and this cross-linking was inhibited with an excess of unlabeled C3a. Many of the known agonists for leukocytes including 13 chemokines (IL-8, NAP-2, GRO alpha, ENA-78, IP10, PF4, MCP-1, 2 and 3, RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta and I309), three neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, somatostatin and calcitonin), as well as C5a, did not activate HMC-1 cells, indicating that C3a is one of a few protein ligands for which this cell line expresses specific receptors. The apparent selectivity for C3a and the abundant expression of C3a receptors make the HMC-1 cell line an excellent choice for the cloning of the receptor genes.","['Legler, D F', 'Loetscher, M', 'Jones, S A', 'Dahinden, C A', 'Arock, M', 'Moser, B']","['Legler DF', 'Loetscher M', 'Jones SA', 'Dahinden CA', 'Arock M', 'Moser B']","['Theodor-Kocher Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Anaphylatoxins)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Anaphylatoxins/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokines/pharmacology', 'Complement C3a/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neuropeptides/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Complement/*biosynthesis/classification/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830260405 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1996 Apr;26(4):753-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830260405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JAKs, a family of intracellular kinases, and the STATs, a family of transcription factors, have both previously been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to various cytokines, interferons, and growth factors in cells of non-skeletal origin. Using three different sources of cells of the osteoblast lineage, we demonstrate that OSM induces a rapid but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the three JAK family members tested, JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2. In addition, two members of the STAT family, Stat1alpha and Stat3, are tyrosine phosphorylated in osteoblastic cells in culture in response to OSM. OSM activation of this pathway in cells of the osteoblast lineage will result in the transcription of specific genes that ultimately may be associated with osteoblast function.","['Levy, J B', 'Schindler, C', 'Raz, R', 'Levy, D E', 'Baron, R', 'Horowitz, M C']","['Levy JB', 'Schindler C', 'Raz R', 'Levy DE', 'Baron R', 'Horowitz MC']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8071, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (gamma interferon activation factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.137.4.8625884 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1996 Apr;137(4):1159-65. doi: 10.1210/endo.137.4.8625884.,,,,"['AR-40073/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-40507/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-42927/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One facet of this response includes the secretion of additional cytokines, some of which are part of the circuitry involved in the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast function. Therefore, understanding which cytokines are able to activate osteoblastic cells and the consequences of that activation are central to understanding normal and pathologic bone remodeling. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a glycoprotein belonging to a new subfamily of cytokines related by sequence and structural homology and the use of the signal transducing receptor component gp130. Osteoblastic cells secrete and respond to leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF) both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that LIF is an autocrine regulatory factor. OSM is closely related to LIF, and therefore we hypothesized that OSM should regulate the function of cells in the osteoblastic lineage. Primary neonatal murine or fetal rat calvarial osteoblastic cultures were treated with OSM or LIF and a series of biochemical and biological parameters were determined. In these cultures, OSM induced proliferation, collagen synthesis, and interleukin-6 secretion, whereas it inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity. Bone resorption was also inhibited by OSM.

CT-1 is a new member of the interleukin 6 (IL-6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokines, which activate downstream signals via gp130-dependent pathways. To define the developmental pattern of expression of CT-1 during murine embryogenesis, we have developed antibodies directed against a CT-1 fusion protein. As assessed by immunolocalization, CT-1 is predominantly expressed in the early mouse embryonic heart tube (E8.5-10.5). In the heart, CT-1 is primarily expressed in myocardial cells, and not in endocardial cushion or outflow tract tissues. After E12.5, CT-1 expression is found in other tissues, including skeletal, liver and dorsal root ganglia. Given the effects of a related family member (ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF) on neuronal cell survival, we studied the ability of CT-1 to promote cardiac myocyte survival and proliferation in vitro. Both CT-1 and LIF, which share the same receptors, dramatically promote neonatal cardiac myocyte survival, while IL-6 and CNTF are without effect. A cell proliferation assay documents that CT-1 provokes an approximate 2-fold increase in embryonic cardiac myocyte proliferation. Thus, CT-1 may play an autocrine role during cardiac chamber growth and morphogenesis by promoting the survival and proliferation of immature myocytes, most likely via gp130-dependent signaling pathways.","['Sheng, Z', 'Pennica, D', 'Wood, W I', 'Chien, K R']","['Sheng Z', 'Pennica D', 'Wood WI', 'Chien KR']","['Department of Medicine, Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California , San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, 92093-0613, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', '*Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Ganglia, Spinal/embryology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gestational Age', 'Heart/*embryology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver/embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle, Skeletal/embryology/metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/physiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1996 Feb;122(2):419-28.,,,,"['1 RO1 HL51549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53773/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL46345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein sequence analysis of the peptides from p46 revealed a high homology with human enolase, an important glycolytic enzyme. Although enolase has been previously identified as a product of several types of tumors, and enolase activity has been detected in the sera of some cancer patients, the existence of autoantibodies directed to enolase has not been described. This is the first report of the presence of serum antibodies to retinal enolase in the patients with cancer and the CAR syndrome. When antibodies of specific isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were measured, IgG1 isotype was dominant. The significance of these antibodies for the disease process is under investigation.","['Adamus, G', 'Aptsiauri, N', 'Guy, J', 'Heckenlively, J', 'Flannery, J', 'Hargrave, P A']","['Adamus G', 'Aptsiauri N', 'Guy J', 'Heckenlively J', 'Flannery J', 'Hargrave PA']","['R.S.

Here, G-band analyses in CBA/H mice of early (1-6 month) post 3 Gy X-irradiation events in bone marrow cells in vivo and of karyotype evolution in one unusual AML are presented. The early event analysis showed that all irradiated animals carry chromosome 2 abnormalities, that chromosome 2 abnormalities are more frequent than expected and that interstitial deletions are more common in chromosome 2 than in the remainder of the genome. On presentation AML case N122 carried a t(2;11) terminal translocation which, with passaging, evolved into a del2(C3F3). Therefore, two pathways in leukaemogenesis might exist, one deletion-driven, the other terminal translocation-driven involving interstitial genes and terminal genes respectively of chromosome 2. As all irradiated individuals carried chromosome 2 abnormalities, the formation of these aberrations does not determine individual leukaemogenic sensitivity as only 20-25% of animals would be expected to develop AML. Similar lines of argument suggest that chromosome 2 abnormalities are necessary but not sufficient for radiation leukaemogenesis in CBA/H nor are they rate limiting in leukaemogenesis.","['Bouffler, S D', 'Breckon, G', 'Cox, R']","['Bouffler SD', 'Breckon G', 'Cox R']","['Biomedical Effects Department, National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Species Specificity']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/17.4.655 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1996 Apr;17(4):655-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/17.4.655.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major AP endonuclease of mammalian cells is encoded by the APE gene. Ape protein has also been proposed to modulate the activity of some transcription factors independently of its AP endonuclease activity. We investigated whether APE expression is coordinated with cell division, which could diminish mutagenesis. The level of APE mRNA was followed during wound healing in porcine epidermis, in which surgical wounding prompts rapid cell proliferation followed by a differentiation program to regenerate normal skin. In situ hybridization with a probe from human APE cDNA revealed strongly decreased expression in rapidly proliferating migrating cells during the first 1-3 days following wounding, succeeded by sharply increased APE expression that exceeded the pre-wounding levels by days 9-17. These changes were not observed in the surrounding undamaged tissue. In contrast to the foregoing in vivo results, APE expression in cultured primary human fibroblasts (IMR90) or myeloid leukemia cells (K562) was not coordinated with cell division. This biphasic APE expression during wound healing could relate to transcription factor regulation or it could allow unhindered DNA synthesis or prepare the developing epidermis to handle DNA damage. However, if transient under-expression of APE-encoded repair enzyme does occur, it might render regenerating skin especially vulnerable to mutagenesis during the cell proliferation phase.","['Harrison, L', 'Galanopoulos, T', 'Ascione, A G', 'Antoniades, H N', 'Demple, B']","['Harrison L', 'Galanopoulos T', 'Ascione AG', 'Antoniades HN', 'Demple B']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carbon-Oxygen Lyases', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', '*DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'Endonucleases/analysis/*metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Swine', '*Wound Healing']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/17.2.377 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1996 Feb;17(2):377-81. doi: 10.1093/carcin/17.2.377.,,,,['GM40000/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the rate of internalization and catabolism of these mAb. After 24 h at 37 degrees C, 20%-25% of initially cell-bound (125)I-CD19 mAb and (125)I-CD22 mAb was degraded in B cells, whereas almost no degredation occurred after binding of (125)I-CD20 mAb. For B cells expressing Fcgamma receptor II (FcgammaRII), isotype-dependent degradation was noted as the CD19 IgGl mAb showed an enhanced degradation rate compared to the switch variant IgG2a. The effect of various pharmaceutical agents that delay the internalization or subsequent degradation of mAb was evaluated. The degradation was inhibited most effectively by a combination of etoposide and vinblastine, resulting in accumulation of radioactivity in the target cell. Also the simultaneous application of CD20 or CD22 with (125)I-CD19 mAb or of CD20 with (125)I-CD22 mAb proved to be a potent inhibitor of the rapid degradation of these mAb, by inhibiting internalization via an FcgammaRII-mediated mechanism. Both methods of reducing the degradation of radioiodinated mAb are expected to prolong irradiation of malignant b cells and consequently result in an enhanced therapeutic effect in vivo.","['Vervoordeldonk, S F', 'Balkenende, A Y', 'van den Berg, H', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'Van Leeuwen, E F', 'Slaper-Cortenbach, I C']","['Vervoordeldonk SF', 'Balkenende AY', 'van den Berg H', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE', 'Van Leeuwen EF', 'Slaper-Cortenbach IC']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Receptors, IgG/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050247 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1996 Jan;42(1):24-30. doi: 10.1007/s002620050247.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When compared to the intensity observed in adjacent normal mucosal epithelial cells, the intensity of Bcl-X immunostaining was elevated in 18 of 30 (60%) carcinomas (P = 0.0001) and 12 of 24 (50%) adenomatous polyps (P = 0.0001). Immunoblot analysis of five pairs of tumors and adjacent normal colonic tissue indicated marked elevations in the relative levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL, protein in all cases. In contrast to the increased Bcl-X expression, the intensity of Bcl-2 immunostaining was greater than that of normal colonic mucosa in only 3 of 30 (10%) carcinomas and, in fact, was lower than that of adjacent normal epithelia] cells in 25 (83%) cases (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, the percentage of Bcl-2 immunopositive cells was generally lower in carcinomas than in adenomas (mean +/- SE, 44 +/- 6% versus 73 +/- 5%, respectively; P = 0.001) and in moderately or poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors (39 +/- 6% versus 70 +/- 11%, respectively; P = 0.045). In addition, the proportion of tumors in which the Bcl-2 immunointensity was more than or equal to that of normal colonic mucosa was significantly lower in carcinomas than adenomas (5 of 30 versus 15 of 24, respectively; P < 0.001), suggesting that decreases in Bcl-2 expression represent a later event associated with the progression of colorectal cancers. When compared to that of normal adjacent colonic epithelium, the intensity of Mcl-1 immunostaining was reduced in 20 of 30 (67%) of carcinomas (P = 0.0001) compared to only 1 of 24 adenomas, suggesting that decreases in Mcl-1 expression represent a later event associated with progression from a benign to a malignant phenotype or with transition to a less-differentiated state, because most of the carcinomas evaluated here (25 of 30; 83%) were not well differentiated. The intensity of immunostaining for the pro-apoptotic protein Bak was reduced compared to that of normal mucosal epithelial cells in 27 of 30 (90%) carcinomas and 22 of 24 (92%) adenomas, suggesting that reductions in Bak expression occur early in colorectal tumor progression (P = 0.0001). In contrast, the intensity of immunostaining for the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was not significantly altered in carcinomas; compared to that of normal colonic mucosa, Bax immunointensity was reduced in only 7 of 30 (23%) carcinomas and 3 of 24 (13%) adenomas, and the percentage of Bax immunopositive cells was also not significantly different in any of the histological subgroups. Taken together, these results suggest that expression of Bcl-XL is increased in undifferentiated primary colorectal cancers, often with accompanying reciprocal decreases in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bak, whereas Bax expression is relatively constant. Thus, a shift from expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 to the Bcl-XL protein may occur during progression of colorectal tumors.","['Krajewska, M', 'Moss, S F', 'Krajewski, S', 'Song, K', 'Holt, P R', 'Reed, J C']","['Krajewska M', 'Moss SF', 'Krajewski S', 'Song K', 'Holt PR', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, Oncogen and Tumor Suppressor Gene Program, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adenoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 May 15;56(10):2422-7.,,,,['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the level of dCK activity in malignant cells is thought to correlate with chemotherapeutic response, no direct data are available to support this assumption. We have tested this hypothesis by infecting three tumor cell lines, MCF-7, HT-29, and H1437, with the retroviral vector LNPO containing either dCK or LacZ cDNA and measuring the corresponding sensitivity to nucleoside analogues. DCK activity was increased by 1.7-, 2.3-, and 16-fold in MCF-7, HT-29, and H1437 cells, respectively. Northern and Western blots demonstrated a similar increase in mRNA and protein levels. As a result of dCK expression, MCF-7 cells demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in drug sensitivity to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA). HT-29 cells had a 7-fold increase in sensitivity to AraC, CdA, and 2-fluoro-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, whereas H1437 cells demonstrated a 20- to 106-fold increase. For all three drugs, there was a linear relationship between dCK activity in clonally derived cell lines and IC50s. These data demonstrate a direct effect of dCK activity on drug sensitivity in cell lines. Because many tumors have relatively low levels of dCK, it is possible that dCK gene transfer will be a useful adjunct to the treatment of these malignancies.","['Hapke, D M', 'Stegmann, A P', 'Mitchell, B S']","['Hapke DM', 'Stegmann AP', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/administration & dosage/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 May 15;56(10):2343-7.,,,,['R0-1-CA34085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In monocytes and monocytic leukemia cells, integrin-mediated adhesion results in a strong induction of a set of immediate early genes that are characteristic of monocytic differentiation and contain consensus NF-kappa B elements in their 5' regulatory regions. To investigate the role of integrin signaling in control of differentiation in a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with an NF-kappa B driven CAT reporter gene. Adhesion to fibronectin or cross-linking of beta1 integrins resulted in an NF-kappa B-dependent induction of CAT activity. To evaluate whether integrin signaling in this system intersects with the Ras signal transduction cascade, THP-1 cells were cotransfected with the NF-kappa B reporter and with plasmids that direct the synthesis of normal or mutant forms of Ras or Raf. We found that Ras or Raf dominant negative mutants did not inhibit integrin-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B-driven reporter. However, cotransfection with activated Ras, or with several other cytoplasmic oncogenes, blocked this process. This suggests that in monocytic leukemia cells, an antagonism exists between the mitogenic signals provided by oncogenes and the signals generated by integrin ligation. This antagonism may play an important role in regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation in monocytic leukemias.","['Rosales, C', 'Juliano, R']","['Rosales C', 'Juliano R']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 May 15;56(10):2302-5.,,,,"['GM26165/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NHLBI 45100/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histopathologic examination and immunochemical staining of tumors produced in nude mice after wild type p53 treatment showed no significant differences when compared to tumors produced by untreated BAT(2)CL6 cells. Therefore, it is likely that the tumors produced by p53 treated-cells arose from cells that escaped transfection. The reduction of tumor size by restoration of wild type 53 may prove to be a useful therapy for BLV-induced tumors.","['Dees, C', 'Godfrey, V L', 'Schultz, R D', 'Travis, C C']","['Dees C', 'Godfrey VL', 'Schultz RD', 'Travis CC']","['Molecular Toxicology Group, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chiroptera', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Genes, p53/genetics/physiology', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology/prevention & control/virology', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/03/19 00:00,1996/03/19 00:01,['1996/03/19 00:00'],"['1996/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383596041250 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(96)04125-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1996 Mar 19;101(1):115-22. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(96)04125-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hybridization signals were seen in 43.8--83.0% of interphase cells in the specimens with a hyperdiploid karyotype. The diagnostic bone marrow sample of the patient with a tetraploid karyotype revealed four signals in 67.0% of cells. Two signals were detected in the majority of the cells in the three nonleukemic control bone marrow samples (97.0--97.7%), assessing the cut-off value of about 1% for trisomy 6. This study demonstrates that FISH analysis is a useful and sensitive tool to screen for the presence of extra chromosomes in interphase cells and is important clinically for evaluating the achievement and maintenance of remission in hyperdiploid childhood ALL.

Ploidy change in the parental cells requires the involvement of two cell cycle lesions. The first, in mitosis, prevents cell division after S-phase. The second, in G1, allows a cell with 4N DNA content to re-enter S-phase. We examined differences in expression of tubulin, a major component of the mitotic spindle and the cellular target for vincristine, between the two cell lines. Levels of the beta III isotype were decreased and levels of acetylated alpha-tubulin, a marker for microtubule stability, were increased in the CEM/VCR R cells relative to the parental line, which suggests that the CEM/VCR R cells have a more stable mitotic spindle. Both cell lines exhibit some level of constitutive expression of p53 and c-myc. Constitutive expression of and mutant p53 would contribute to the failure of these cells to recognise G1 checkpoints. Therefore, G1 checkpoint failure and the intrinsically less stable mitotic spindle in the CCRF-CEM cells may contribute to the observed ploidy instability. Conversely, the presence of markers of microtubule stability in the CEM/VCR R cells would predispose them to maintain their ploidy.","['Geyp, M', 'Ireland, C M', 'Pittman, S M']","['Geyp M', 'Ireland CM', 'Pittman SM']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Tubulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', '*Ploidies', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(95)00235-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00235-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Apr;87(2):116-22. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00235-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical, laboratory, and prognostic correlations.",992-7,"BACKGROUND: The breakpoint site of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) has been correlated with patient characteristics, with the disease phase, and with the prognosis of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but the findings remain controversial. METHODS: Appropriate restriction enzymes and the 3' and universal probes were used to map the breakpoint site by Southern blot analysis into 5' and 3' breakpoints and a breakpoint in zone 3 (or fragment 2) in 362 patients in different phases of CML (238 in early chronic phase, 69 in late chronic phase, 31 in accelerated phase, and 24 in blastic phase). Standard statistical methods were used to evaluate differences in characteristics and in prognosis by the breakpoint site. RESULTS: No correlation was noted between CML phases and breakpoint site. Among patients in the early chronic phase, thrombocytosis was significantly associated with the 3' breakpoint site (P = 0.02), whereas peripheral basophilia occurred more frequently with the 5' breakpoint site (P = 0.05). Other patient and disease characteristics were similar in frequency among the breakpoint-site subgroups. There was no difference in response to alpha-interferon therapy (186 patients treated) by the breakpoint site. Survival, dated from either referral to the authors' institution or from diagnosis, was not significantly different among patients with early chronic phase CML by the breakpoint site. However, patients with a 3' deletion tended to have a shorter survival.

Cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular changes.",985-91,"BACKGROUND: There have been published reports on cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular changes at relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) including lineage switch and secondary leukemia. There are limited data, however, on the cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular parameters of adult ALL at relapse. Because, as in children, the cytogenetic and/or immunophenotypic changes observed in adult ALL at relapse may have prognostic significance, the authors investigated the significance of such changes. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with relapsed adult ALL for whom cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and/or molecular analyses were performed at diagnosis and at relapse were studied. Changes in any of the parameters at relapse were correlated with total survival and survival from the time of relapse. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients for whom cytogenetic studies were performed at relapse, 21 (66%) showed clonal cytogenetic changes, 40% of which were clonal evolution. None of these cases, however, showed two entirely different abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis and at relapse. The immunophenotypes showed occasional gain or loss of one or two surface markers, and the molecular genetic configurations for JH, JK, and the T-cell receptor beta were stable throughout the evolution of the disease. Patients with clonal evolution had a shorter overall survival than the rest of the group (P = 0.02). This difference, however, was not significant with respect to survival measured from the time of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent changes in the biologic profile of adult ALL at relapse are shifts in the karyotype, with or without clonal evolution. Clonal evolution detected at relapse is associated with a higher frequency of unfavorable karyotypes at diagnosis and with a worse overall prognosis. However, survival from the time of relapse is similar in patients with and without clonal evolution.","['Chucrallah, A E', 'Stass, S A', 'Huh, Y O', 'Albitar, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Chucrallah AE', 'Stass SA', 'Huh YO', 'Albitar M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

The clinical spectrum of 51 patients.,869-74,"BACKGROUND: Over a 15 year period, the authors followed 51 male patients with myelodysplastic syndromes whose clinical findings, laboratory data, and evolution demonstrated a wide spectrum of disease. METHODS: The following characteristics were assessed: age at diagnosis, risk factors, clinical presentation, laboratory features, category of myelodysplasia, leukemic conversion, and overall survival. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations included hemolytic episodes in two patients, antibody-mediated thrombopenia in one, marked marrow fibrosis in two; thrombocytosis in three, and simultaneous lymphoproliferative disorders in two. There were 21 patients whose marrow was either normo- or hypocellular. Six patients presented with single cytopenia but not anemia. There were six instances of overlapping of the French-American-British classification. Eighteen patients progressed to acute leukemia and 1 to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that patients with myelodysplastic syndromes may have single cytopenia without anemia that progresses to acute leukemia and may, rarely, evolve into chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The clinical aspects of these syndromes may include autoimmune phenomena and myeloproliferative features.","['Ahmad, Y H', 'Kiehl, R', 'Papac, R J']","['Ahmad YH', 'Kiehl R', 'Papac RJ']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, West Haven Veterans Administration Medical Center, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950901)76:5<869::aid-cncr2820760522>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Sep 1;76(5):869-74. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950901)76:5<869::aid-cncr2820760522>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the normal allele of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene is frequently deleted in some of the malignant tumors that arise in patients with NF1, the role of NF1 alterations in the sporadic forms of these cancers is unclear. METHODS: A series of intragenic sequence polymorphisms was used to investigate lymphocyte and tumor DNA samples from 22 adults with high grade malignant gliomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at NF1. In addition, an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction was used to screen these tumors for point mutations at codon 1423. RESULTS: One recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma showed LOH within NF1 but not with a flanking marker located near the gene. Of 21 informative tumors, none showed point mutations affecting codon 1423 of NF1. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that LOH at NF1 is uncommon in sporadic high grade astrocytoma, and codon 1423 is not a ""hot spot"" for activating point mutations in these tumors.","['Jensen, S', 'Paderanga, D C', 'Chen, P', 'Olson, K', 'Edwards, M', 'Iavorone, A', 'Israel, M A', 'Shannon, K']","['Jensen S', 'Paderanga DC', 'Chen P', 'Olson K', 'Edwards M', 'Iavorone A', 'Israel MA', 'Shannon K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Astrocytoma/*genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<674::aid-cncr2820760421>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Aug 15;76(4):674-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<674::aid-cncr2820760421>3.0.co;2-4.,,,,"['3M01 RR01271-13S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 31076/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is useful to study patients with cancer treated with radiation because exposure can be measured accurately, follow-up may be long, and often a comparable and sizable nonexposed group exists. Women with endometrial cancer represent an excellent population for study because they meet these Developed Leukemia After Endometrial. METHODS: A population-based matched case-control study, nested among all patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed in Ontario, was undertaken to describe the relationship between radiation therapy and leukemia risk. Among 13,843 subjects treated from 1964 to 1987 who survived at least 1 year, 47 confirmed cases of leukemia were identified. Four control subjects were matched to each patient based on age, calendar year of diagnosis, and length of survival free of a second neoplasm. Medical records were abstracted, and radiation dose administered to active bone marrow was determined by dosimetry. RESULTS: An elevated risk of all leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia was observed, but only within the first 10 years after endometrial cancer treatment (odds ratio 12.0; 90% confidence interval 2.8-52.1). There was insufficient statistical evidence that risk was influenced by dose or type of radiation therapy. Nor was there any evidence that risk was influenced by age at endometrial cancer diagnosis or by calendar period at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of leukemia associated with radiation therapy for patients with endometrial cancer, but only within the first 10 years after treatment.","['Holowaty, E J', 'Darlington, G A', 'Gajalakshmi, C K', 'Toogood, P B', 'Levin, W']","['Holowaty EJ', 'Darlington GA', 'Gajalakshmi CK', 'Toogood PB', 'Levin W']","['Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Toronto.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ontario', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Registries', 'Time Factors']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<644::aid-cncr2820760416>3.0.co;2-u [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Aug 15;76(4):644-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<644::aid-cncr2820760416>3.0.co;2-u.,,,,['CP-71123-56/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A patient with CLL that transformed into a lymphoma of true histiocytic type is described, and the literature on the association of these two disorders is reviewed. RESULTS: Lymphomas of true histiocytic type developing as an aggressive terminal phase of CLL previously have been reported in nine patients. Fever and rapidly increasing lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were the most common signs and symptoms. As with de novo lymphoma of true histiocytic type, extranodal involvement of the soft tissue, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, bone marrow, liver, and lungs was documented among the 10 patients with lymphoma of true histiocytic type transformed from CLL. The median interval between diagnosis of CLL and the evolution to lymphoma of true histiocytic type was 25.5 months. Patients with lymphomas of true histiocytic type after CLL were treated with fludarabine and various other combination chemotherapy regimens with only short-lived responses. The median time to death after transformation was only 33 days (range, 10 days to 5 months). CONCLUSION: Lymphomas of true histiocytic type appear to represent an additional, though uncommon, form of transformation in CLL. Although their presentation is reminiscent of other intermediate to high grade lymphomas, they can be distinguished based on their morphologic and immunophenotypic features. In the patients described in this study to date, transformation of CLL to lymphomas of true histiocytic type is a poor prognostic sign, with survival generally of only days to weeks.","['Wetzler, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Goodacre, A M', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Ku, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Wetzler M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Goodacre AM', 'McLaughlin P', 'Ku S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Trisomy']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<609::aid-cncr2820760411>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Aug 15;76(4):609-17. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950815)76:4<609::aid-cncr2820760411>3.0.co;2-y.,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors studied the cost-benefit of this new treatment modality compared with conventional chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with APL. METHODS: Costs were calculated retrospectively through the monthly bills of each patient to national health insurance and were compared between 36 patients treated with conventional chemotherapy in the AML-87 or AML-89 studies and 40 patients treated with all-trans RA alone or with all-trans RA plus low dose chemotherapy in the AML-92 study of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group who were treated at 22 university and cancer hospitals in Japan. RESULTS: Average medical costs except for antileukemic drugs during 2 months after admission were 4,164,026 yen (approximately US$46,300) in the chemotherapy group and 2,906,825 yen (approximately US$32,300) in the all-trans RA group (P < 0.0001). The difference resulted mainly from the costs of antibiotics and of platelet and erythrocyte transfusions. Average costs of antibiotics were 650,494 yen (approximately US$7,200) and 349,138 yen (approximately US$3,900), respectively (P < 0.0002), and those of platelet and erythrocyte transfusions were 1,016,190 yen (approximately US$11,300) and 633,444 yen (approximately US$7,000), respectively (P < 0.0020).

An international cancer registries study.,442-52,"BACKGROUND: The pattern of second cancers after treatment for cervical cancer provides important information on the risk of radiation-induced malignancies. Large numbers of women survive many years and can be studied for late effects. METHODS: Incident second cancers in 86,193 patients with cervical cancer reported to 13 population-based cancer registries in 5 countries were evaluated to estimate the risk of second cancer among very long term survivors. RESULTS: Overall, 7543 second cancers were observed versus 6015 cancers expected based on population rates (observed/expected = 1.2). Lung cancer accounted for nearly half of the excess cancers. Among the 49,828 women treated with radiation, 3750 survived 30 or more years and a two-fold risk of cancers of heavily irradiated organs was seen. Most of the excess cancers were of the rectum, vagina, vulva, ovary, and bladder. Patterns of risk over time since treatment were consistent with a radiation etiology. Significant increases of nonchronic lymphocytic leukemia and cancers of the bone and kidney were also linked to radiotherapy. Women treated surgically were also at significant risk of second cancers, in all likelihood related to cigarette smoking and risk factors similar to those of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Curative therapy for cervical cancer results in large numbers of long term survivors who develop second cancers very late in life. Radiation is an important cause of this increase and there is no evidence that risk returns to normal levels.","['Kleinerman, R A', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Storm, H H', 'Sparen, P', 'Andersen, A', 'Pukkala, E', 'Lynch, C F', 'Hankey, B F', 'Flannery, J T']","['Kleinerman RA', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Storm HH', 'Sparen P', 'Andersen A', 'Pukkala E', 'Lynch CF', 'Hankey BF', 'Flannery JT']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7362, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1995/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950801)76:3<442::aid-cncr2820760315>3.0.co;2-l [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Aug 1;76(3):442-52. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950801)76:3<442::aid-cncr2820760315>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,"['N01-CP-85626-01/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-85638-02/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-85639-03/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Positive correlation with spleen size but not with tumor cell burden or low density lipoprotein receptor activity.,423-8,"BACKGROUND: Hypocholesterolemia is common in patients with various malignant diseases, and may be a risk factor for the development or a consequence of the tumor, by different possible mechanisms. METHODS: Serum lipids were analyzed in 66 patients with symptomatic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) before and repeatedly after treatment with cladribine. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity of hairy cells from 12 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median pretreatment serum cholesterol was 4.78 mmol/l. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were inversely correlated with the spleen size, but not with other markers of tumor burden. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol correlated to serum beta 2-microglobulin. Anemia and hypocholesterolemia developed synchronously before diagnosis in one patient. After cladribine therapy, there was a highly significant increase in all serum lipids. Low density lipoprotein receptor activity of HCL cells was elevated in only one of 12 patients; this patient had high serum cholesterol. Hypocholesterolemia predicted posttreatment neutropenic fever. CONCLUSION: Hypocholesterolemia is a common disease-related finding in HCL, which is not caused by an increased LDL receptor activity of leukemia cells, but related to spleen size, predicts posttreatment fever, and is completely reverted after successful treatment of leukemia.","['Juliusson, G', 'Vitols, S', 'Liliemark, J']","['Juliusson G', 'Vitols S', 'Liliemark J']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Dyslipidemias/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, LDL/*metabolism', 'Spleen/*pathology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950801)76:3<423::aid-cncr2820760312>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Aug 1;76(3):423-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950801)76:3<423::aid-cncr2820760312>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these regimens, anthracyclines, which are considerably cardiotoxic, are used. Mitoxantrone is structurally related to the anthracyclines, but it is considered to be less cardiotoxic. Therefore, the effectiveness of mitoxantrone in treating childhood T-cell malignancies was studied. METHODS: Fourteen newly diagnosed children with T-cell malignancies (12 T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) initially were treated with one bolus injection of mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2 intravenously, 1 week before standard induction therapy was begun. The effect of mitoxantrone was evaluated at Day 8, just before standard induction therapy was begun. RESULTS: Of 12 evaluable patients, 11 had significant positive responses with regard to the size of the primary tumor, the size of the involved peripheral lymph nodes, and the presence of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood.

A comprehensive review with emphasis on biology and therapy.,2393-417,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. It is now curable in 60-70% of children. Most of the current understanding of the biology and treatment of ALL originates from studies of children. In adults, although much progress has been achieved, ALL is curable in only 20-35% of patients. METHODS: A review of the biology and treatment of ALL from the English literature was performed. RESULTS: Immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analyses of ALL have contributed to a more rational classification of ALL. These analyses have identified subgroups with poor prognosis or with different therapeutic requirements. Overall, 60-70% of adults with ALL have poor prognostic features, including older age, a high leukocyte count, non-T-cell immunophenotype, Ph-positive genotype, and longer time to achieve a complete remission. These patients have a cure rate of 20-25%, whereas those without these risk factors, have a 60-70% probability of survival. The use of more intensive induction regimens with growth factor support may improve survival rates. Also, intensive consolidation-intensification may improve survival rates. Most patients benefit from maintenance therapy, but the dose schedule must be optimized. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is beneficial, particularly for patients with a high risk for CNS relapse and when introduced early during induction of remission. Patients with high risk characteristics may benefit from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during first remission, and all other patients may benefit from it during first or subsequent relapse. Autologous BMT may be a valuable option for poor compliant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prognosis of patients with ALL has improved markedly during the past decades, newer strategies, including more dose-intensive therapy, the search for new drugs, and more target-specific therapy, are needed to improve the current cure rates.","['Cortes, J E', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951215)76:12<2393::aid-cncr2820761203>3.0.co;2-p [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Dec 15;76(12):2393-417. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951215)76:12<2393::aid-cncr2820761203>3.0.co;2-p.,,,366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the incidence of SMNs in long term survivors of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was studied. METHODS: From 1970 to 1989, 210 newly diagnosed patients (median age, 9.7 years; range, 1 month to 27 years) with RMS were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). Multimodality treatment included chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy, when indicated. There were 130 long term survivors (> 2 years off therapy) with a median follow-up of 9 years (range, 2-20 years). The cumulative dose of each chemotherapeutic agent and the radiation doses each patient received were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed by comparison with the Connecticut Tumor Registry data. RESULTS: Seven patients developed a SMN, including three with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and four with solid tumors. Acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia developed a median of 4.5 years after diagnosis. Of the solid tumors, 3 developed within the radiation field at a median of 10 years after diagnosis, whereas the fourth occurred 9.3 years after initial diagnosis in a patient who did not receive radiotherapy. All seven patients with SMNs received total dactinomycin doses higher than the median (9.6 mg/M2) for the group. All three patients with ANLL received total cyclophosphamide doses higher than the median (16.8 g/M2). Moreover, six of the seven patients received a dose of radiotherapy greater than 4000 cGy. The standardized incidence ratio was: 17.07 (95% confidence interval, 6.68-35.18; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality therapy has improved long term survival for patients with childhood RMS. The combination of high dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy appears to increase the risk for developing a second malignancy.","['Scaradavou, A', 'Heller, G', 'Sklar, C A', 'Ren, L', 'Ghavimi, F']","['Scaradavou A', 'Heller G', 'Sklar CA', 'Ren L', 'Ghavimi F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*therapy', 'Survivors']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951115)76:10<1860::aid-cncr2820761027>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Nov 15;76(10):1860-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951115)76:10<1860::aid-cncr2820761027>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This treatment includes cranial irradiation as prophylaxis against central nervous system relapse. The late effects of irradiation are well documented, but their incidence is unknown. The authors investigated the late effects of this treatment modality further by scanning 35 long term survivors of ALL who received cranial irradiation. METHODS: Thirty-five survivors of ALL with no known complication of treatment were included in this study. They were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the circle of Willis. A control group of 24 patients who were cured of other childhood malignancies without exposure to cranial irradiation also were scanned. RESULTS: Fifteen of 35 (43%) abnormalities were found in the study group versus 4/24 (17%) in the control group. Excluding minor atrophic changes that are known to be produced by irradiation and chemotherapy, there were 9/35 (26%) abnormalities in the study group and 1/24 (4%) in the control group (P < 0.05). These abnormalities included three tumors, a meningioma, a paranasal sinus rhabdomyosarcoma, and an anaplastic astrocytoma. In addition, there were two cases of large vessel vasculopathy, two small cystic infarcts, one diffuse white matter abnormality, and one cryptic vascular malformation. The abnormal control patient had a cerebellar infarct. CONCLUSION: Complications of cranial irradiation in the treatment of ALL appear to be more frequent than currently are appreciated. That these complications include tumors that are potentially treatable suggests that screening may be valuable for these patients.","['Laitt, R D', 'Chambers, E J', 'Goddard, P R', 'Wakeley, C J', 'Duncan, A W', 'Foreman, N K']","['Laitt RD', 'Chambers EJ', 'Goddard PR', 'Wakeley CJ', 'Duncan AW', 'Foreman NK']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, United Bristol Health Care Trust, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circle of Willis/*pathology', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*radiotherapy']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951115)76:10<1846::aid-cncr2820761025>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Nov 15;76(10):1846-52. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951115)76:10<1846::aid-cncr2820761025>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were no differences in the rates of documented and fatal infections, which were relatively high in both groups. In the patients with ANLL, there was no evidence that HGF accelerated leukemic regrowth.

Four hundred and twenty-two patients with ALL who completed therapy during the period 1975-1991 were followed. Two hundred and sixty patients received the aggressive MCP 841 protocol and 162 patients received various other less aggressive treatment regimens. Patients were followed with periodic examination and complete blood counts. The incidence of post therapy relapse was 27% in the less aggressive protocols and 15% in the MCP 841 protocol (p = 0.001). An higher percentage of relapses was seen in males (p = 0.05) and 89% relapses occurred within two years of stopping therapy. The relapse rate after 5 years of cessation of therapy was 0.59%. In conclusion, aggressive induction therapy is the most crucial factor in predicting relapses following cessation of therapy in ALL patients. However, relapses are unlikely to occur five years post therapy.","['Vaidya, S J', 'Advani, S H', 'Pai, S K', 'Nair, C N', 'Kurkure, P A', 'Saikia, T K', 'Gopal, R', 'Pai, V R', 'Nadkarni, K S', 'Parikh, P M']","['Vaidya SJ', 'Advani SH', 'Pai SK', 'Nair CN', 'Kurkure PA', 'Saikia TK', 'Gopal R', 'Pai VR', 'Nadkarni KS', 'Parikh PM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051623 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jan;20(3-4):311-5. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051623.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of this therapeutic approach probably include anti-leukemic immune response or ""graft-versus-leukemia"" (GVL) reaction against leukemic cell clones, since even aggressive chemotherapy is not sufficient per se to cure this type of disease. In many patients, allogeneic BMT results in the disappearance of the Ph chromosome; this negativity does not exclude the presence of residual leukemic cells since sensitivity of cytogenetic analysis is low. The chimeric BCR-ABL gene in CML is a tumor-specific marker that is well suited to allowing detection of low numbers of residual leukemic cells through the extremely sensitive detection method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using this method, 1 leukemic cell in 10(5) or 10(6) normal cells can be detected. Many studies have evaluated the clinical significance and predictive value of BCR-ABL gene rearrangement detected by PCR assay after BMT, most often on heterogeneous populations. Results from such studies have been conflicting. We have conducted a review of the literature, focussing on long-term survivors (> 3 years from BMT) of CML to determine the value of PCR in such patients (n = 183). With the consideration that such a population is obviously heterogenous, long-term PCR negativity strongly correlated with achieving a cure since no patient relapsed in this population (n = 117). Among the PCR positive patients (n = 66), only 5 (8%) relapsed, suggesting a poor prognostic value for a PCR+ test > 36 months post-transplant. Besides the potential clinical value of these data, they contribute to the understanding of the biology of the disease and may suggest a crucial role for the long term GVL effect of marrow transplantation.","['Costello, R T', 'Kirk, J', 'Gabert, J']","['Costello RT', 'Kirk J', 'Gabert J']","['Department of Biology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre Regional de Lutte Contre Le Cancer, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051613 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jan;20(3-4):239-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051613.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some ATL patients show unusual integration patterns such as multiple or defective HTLV-I and have clinical characteristics unlike those of most ATL patients who have the characteristic integration pattern of one complete provirus. Multiple HTLV-I integrations can be detected as two or more bands using the standard Southern blotting method when the tumor cellular DNA is digested with an endonuclease that does not cleave within the provirus. This includes cases of one tumor cell clone carrying two or more copies of the provirus, or alternatively two or more cell clones, each carrying one copy of the provirus. The former group of patients always manifest severe dyspnea and hypoxemia with unusual organ infiltrations including the retina and muscle and an extremely aggressive clinical course. On the other hand, the latter group of patients have an indolent course with skin lesions or small T lymphocytes with cleaved or lobulated nuclei. A solitary defective HTLV-I in some ATL patients can be detected as one smaller band after digestion of cellular DNA with an endonuclease that does not cleave within the provirus. These patients generally have a favourable clinical course with small cleaved or bilobulated T lymphocytes without lymphadenopathy or skin lesions. These findings suggest that there are clinical implications for the integration patterns of HTLV-I and this may be one of the explanations for the heterogeneous behaviour of the disease. Such studies may provide information on the relationship between virus integration and the clinical manifestations and also improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of ATL.","['Shimamoto, Y', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Miyamoto, Y']","['Shimamoto Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Miyamoto Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051609 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jan;20(3-4):207-15. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051609.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From this review, it is evident that discrepancies exist for the detection of residual disease for patients who remain in complete remission and for those who relapse.

Particularly in patients with prolonged neutropenia, subsequent adaptation of such a regimen will be the rule rather than exception. Since there are no uniformly accepted guidelines for the modification of antibiotic therapy during the post-empiric phase, we assessed the impact of a set of rules that evolved during the first randomized trials. Evaluation of the clinician's compliance with these rules in 1951 febrile neutropenic episodes was the subject of the present analysis. Treatment was modified in 761 (39%) cases, and these changes were made according to the rules in 76%. For 75% of the alterations in treatment during the evening and night shifts, no reasonable explanation was established, while 93% of the modifications during the normal working hours were made for objective reasons. The empiric regimen was more frequently changed in patients with a clinical focus of infection at the onset of fever than in patients who showed fever as the only symptom of a possible infection. The perceived need for modification amounted to 69% in pulmonary infections, to 51% in skin and soft-tissue infections, to 44% in patients with abdominal complaints, and to 37% in upper respiratory tract infections. Glycopeptides constituted 22% of modifications, particularly in patients with a central venous catheter, and systemically active antifungals were administered in 16% of cases. Especially inexperienced clinicians tend to adjust antibiotic therapy, in spite of the fact that persistence of fever alone seldom reflects inadequate treatment when the clinical condition of the patient is stable or improving. On the other hand, the development of subsequent infectious events emphasizes that a genuine need for modification does frequently exist.","['De Pauw, B E', 'Dompeling, E C']","['De Pauw BE', 'Dompeling EC']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/etiology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050172 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Apr;72(4):273-9. doi: 10.1007/s002770050172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By definition, AML-M0 includes acute leukemias which do not fit morphological and cytochemical criteria for the diagnosis of AML, and for which myeloid lineage assignment can be made by immunological assay showing positivity for MPO, CD13, and CD33 and negativity for lymphoid markers. Involvement of an early myeloid progenitor in the leukemic process is a possible theory hypothesized to explain the existence of such a form. Validity of this assumption has been based on the observation that AML-M0 frequently bears ""stem cell"" markers such as CD34, HLA-DR, Tdt, CD7, and promiscuous IgH/TCR gene rearrangements, which are thought to occur in uncommitted cells. Finally, AML-M0 very frequently carries cytogenetic abnormalities common to MDS or secondary AML, such as -5/5q- or -7/7q- deletions and or complex karyotype. In our experience, AML-M0 is also very often associated with the MDR phenotype, which in turn has been found strictly linked to ""stem cell"" features, especially in MDS. These biological aspects, altogether, translate into a very unfavorable prognosis, confirming even from a clinical point of view that AML-M0 is a distinct entity. In conclusion, ""stem cell"" markers, MDR phenotype, complex chromosome lesions, frequent occurrence in elderly patients, and intrinsic chemoresistance characterize AML-M0 and indicate the need for tailored treatments, possibly involving the use of MDR modulators and/or differentiating agents.","['Amadori, S', 'Venditti, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Stasi, R', 'Buccisano, F', 'Bruno, A', 'Tamburini, A', 'Cox, M C', 'Maffei, L', 'Aronica, G', 'Simone, M D', 'Adorno, G', 'Masi, M', 'Tribalto, M', 'Papa, G']","['Amadori S', 'Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Stasi R', 'Buccisano F', 'Bruno A', 'Tamburini A', 'Cox MC', 'Maffei L', 'Aronica G', 'Simone MD', 'Adorno G', 'Masi M', 'Tribalto M', 'Papa G']","['Chair of Hematology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) has been introduced in clinical trials more than 20 years ago, since it has several theoretical advantages compared to conventional dose methotrexate. These trials revealed that the efficacy and toxicity of HDMTX depends on features such as dose level, infusion time, combination regimen and schedule of leucovorin rescue. Particularly the application of controlled leucovorin rescue and improved supportive care enabled the application of increasing doses of HDMTX in the treatment of childhood and adult ALL within a variety of schedules and at dose levels mostly ranging between 0.5 g/m2 and 5.0 g/m2. In childhood ALL, first devised to replace CNS irradiation in the prophylaxis of CNS relapse HDMTX has contributed to the reduction of bone marrow relapses particularly in low risk B-lineage ALL. In addition it proved to be an effective therapy element for prophylaxis and treatment of CNS disease. At least in low risk ALL CNS irradiation could be safely replaced by repeated cycles of HDMTX with additional intrathecal therapy. In adult ALL only few of the successful treatment approaches with HDMTX have been investigated up to now. The results indicate that HDMTX has a beneficial effect with regard to overall outcome in adult B-lineage ALL. It provides effective CNS prophylaxis in combination with intrathecal therapy. In mature B-ALL HDMTX proved to be one of the most effective treatment elements and contributed to an impressive improvement of outcome in this subgroup. For T-ALL however sufficient data do not exist either in childhood or in adult ALL. Since HDMTX is an effective treatment element with manageable acute and long-term toxicity, its role in the management of adult ALL should be explored more intensively.","['Gokbuget, N', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['University Clinics Frankfurt, Department of Internal Medicine, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050160 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Apr;72(4):194-201. doi: 10.1007/s002770050160.,,,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of leukaemia among children aged 0-4 during 1953-57 to 1988-90. In this age group, the recorded incidence rate increased from 4.89 per 100,000 person-years in 1953-57 to 7.92 in 1988-90. During 1973-77 to 1988-90 (and probably in earlier years), the increase was due to an increase in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The trends were unlikely to be due to changes in diagnosis or case ascertainment. The childhood leukaemia trends might be related to trends in family size, maternal age, socioeconomic level or exposure to infections. However, there are uncertainties about the importance of these factors or about their trends. The incidence of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) decreased between 1968-72 and 1988-90. The time trends highlight the likely importance of environmental factors in the aetiology of childhood leukaemias in New Zealand. The risk of ALL was lower in the Maori than in the non-Maori population (relative risk Maori/non-Maori 0.74).

Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding lectin previously designated as epsilon BP (IgE-binding protein), CBP35, Mac-2, L-29, and L-34, and its expression has been associated with various physiological and pathological processes, including cell growth, tumor transformation, and metastasis. Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many leukocytes, with the notable exception of B and T lymphocytes. We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-infected human T cell lines, including F6T, HUT 102, K3T, MT-2, and SLB-I, but is not expressed in non-HTLV-I-infected T cell lines such as Jurkat, CEM, and MOLT-4. In addition, the galectin-3 level was markedly increased in human thymocytes after infection with HTLV-I as compared with uninfected thymocytes. The up-regulation of galectin-3 expression appeared to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression, as undetectable or very low levels of galectin-3 were found in the S1T and ATL-1K cell lines, which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I. In co-transfection experiments, the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors encoding the 40-kd Tax protein, a potent transactivator in HTLV-I. Analysis of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and, to a lesser extent, nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction. Transfection of human promonocytic U-937 cells with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced galectin-3 expression in this cell line. Functionally, galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells. Together, these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of galectin-3, which in turn may further activate these T cells and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-I.","['Hsu, D K', 'Hammes, S R', 'Kuwabara, I', 'Greene, W C', 'Liu, F T']","['Hsu DK', 'Hammes SR', 'Kuwabara I', 'Greene WC', 'Liu FT']","['Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Galectin 3', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*metabolism/*virology', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry/cytology/virology', 'Transfection']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 May;148(5):1661-70.,,,,"['AI20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI32834/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'M01RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1861566,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in the expression of these apoptosis-regulating genes can contribute to the origins of cancer, as well as adversely influence tumor responses to chemo- and radiotherapy. Using antibodies specific for the Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X, and Mcl-1 proteins in combination with immunohistochemical methods, we examined for the first time the expression of these bcl-2 family genes in 64 cases of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, including 10 Gleason grade 2 to 4 tumors, 21 grade 5 to 7 tumors, 17 grade 8 to 10 tumors, 8 lymph node metastases, and 8 bone metastases. In addition, 24 cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or PIN coexisting with carcinoma were also evaluated. All immunostaining results were scored with regard to approximate percentage of positive tumor cells and relative immunostaining intensity. Expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was present in 16 of 64 (25%) adenocarcinomas and tended to be more frequent in high grade tumors (Gleason grade 8 to 10; 41%) and nodal metastases (38%) than in lower grade (Gleason 2 to 7) primary tumors (16%; P < 0.05). Bcl-X was expressed in all 64 (100%) tumors evaluated. Bcl-X immunointensity was generally stronger in high grade primary tumors (grade 8 to 10) and metastases compared with PIN and low grade neoplasms (P < 0.0001). In addition, the proportion of specimens with > 50% Bcl-X-immunopositive tumor cells also was higher in advanced grade primary tumors (Gleason 8 to 10) and metastases than in PIN and low grade tumors (Gleason 2 to 7; P < 0.005). The anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was expressed in 52 of 64 (81%) tumors, compared with only 9 of 24 (38%) cases of PIN (P < 0.001). In addition, the percentage of Mcl-1-positive cells was typically higher in Gleason grade 8 to 10 tumors and metastases than in PIN or lower grade tumors (P = 0.025). In contrast, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was expressed in all prostate cancers evaluated, with high percentages of immunopositive cells and strong immunointensity typically occurring regardless of tumor grade. The findings suggest that expression of several anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 gene family, including bcl-2, bcl-X, and mcl-1 increases during progression of prostate cancers, a finding that may be relevant to the hormone-insensitive, metastatic phenotype of most advanced adenocarcinomas of the prostate.","['Krajewska, M', 'Krajewski, S', 'Epstein, J I', 'Shabaik, A', 'Sauvageot, J', 'Song, K', 'Kitada, S', 'Reed, J C']","['Krajewska M', 'Krajewski S', 'Epstein JI', 'Shabaik A', 'Sauvageot J', 'Song K', 'Kitada S', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 May;148(5):1567-76.,,,,['CA-58236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1861561,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four monoclonal antibodies (PG-B6, PG-B6a, PG-B6p, and PG-B6m), specifically directed against the human BCL-6 protein, were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with a recombinant protein corresponding to the BCL-6 amino-terminal region (amino acids 3 to 484). The PG-B6 monoclonal antibody reacted with a BCL-6 epitope sensitive to fixatives and preserved in all mammalian species. PG-B6a (a is for avian) recognized the most evolutionarily conserved BCL-6 epitope (expressed in all animal species including avian). PG-B6p (p is for paraffin) recognized a fixative-resistant epitope of BCL-6 that was detectable on paraffin sections after microwave heating in 1 mmol/L EDTA buffer. PG-B6m (m is for mantle) was the least specific monoclonal antibody as, in addition to BCL-6, it reacted with a yet undefined antigen selectively located in the cytoplasm of mantle and marginal zone B cells. All monoclonal antibodies detected strong nuclear expression of BCL-6 in follicular lymphomas, diffuse large B cell lymphomas, Burkitt's lymphomas, and nodular, lymphocyte-predominance Hodgkin's disease. In diffuse large B cell lymphomas, BCL-6 expression was independent of BCL-6 gene rearrangements and did not correlate with expression of other markers or the proliferation index. BCL-6 was not expressed in B-CLL, hairy cell leukemia, mantle-cell- and marginal-zone-derived lymphomas. Labeling of paraffin sections with PG-B6p proved useful for differentiating proliferation centers in B-CLL (BCl-2+/BCL-6-) from trapped germinal centers in mantle cell lymphomas (BCL-2-/BCL-6+) and for identifying neoplastic cells in cases of nodular, lymphocyte-predominance Hodgkin's disease.

Most of these translocations occur at the major translocation cluster (MTC) in a tight area that makes this rearrangement identifiable by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, the specificity and sensitivity of the PCR technique in the identification of bcl-1 rearrangement and its suitability to amplify the t(11;14) MTC in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were analyzed. Genomic DNA was obtained from 21 MCLs and 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with the t(11;14) translocation. The bcl-1 rearrangement was studied by Southern blot with the MTC, p94PS, and PRAD-1 probes. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using a JH consensus primer and specific primers for chromosome II in the MTC region. bcl-1 rearrangement was identified by Southern blot in the MTC in nine (43%) MCLs and in the p94PS region in the CLL. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of genomic DNA showed that the nine MCLs with MTC rearrangement also had an amplifiable band of the expected size (100%). No amplifiable products were detected in the negative MCLs or in the CLL. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by hybridization with an internal MTC oligonucleotide probe. Amplifiable DNA was obtained from the paraffin blocks of 7 cases with MTC rearrangement and 11 negative tumors. bcl-1 rearrangement was detected in this DNA of 6 positive MCLs (86%) by PCR and in none of the negative cases. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the PCR technique is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of the bcl-1 rearrangement at the MTC. It can be used with both high molecular weight DNA and DNA obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.","['Pinyol, M', 'Campo, E', 'Nadal, A', 'Terol, M J', 'Jares, P', 'Nayach, I', 'Fernandez, P L', 'Piris, M A', 'Montserrat, E', 'Cardesa, A']","['Pinyol M', 'Campo E', 'Nadal A', 'Terol MJ', 'Jares P', 'Nayach I', 'Fernandez PL', 'Piris MA', 'Montserrat E', 'Cardesa A']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Frozen Sections', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/105.5.532 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 May;105(5):532-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/105.5.532.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-II(G12) IN proved active on HTLV-II(G12) and HIV-1 integration and disintegration substrates. Distinct differences in requirements for enzyme concentration for 3'-processing, strand-transfer, and disintegration reactions were observed. Catalysis of integration reactions occurred in the presence of either Mn2+ or Mg2+, although strand-transfer activity preferred Mn2+. In comparison, HTLV-II(G12) IN catalyzed disintegration reactions with almost 10-fold less protein, was not selective for Mn2+ or Mg2+, and tolerated higher NaCl concentrations than integration.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with hematologic malignancy, mainly acute myeloid leukemia, were prospectively assigned in a random manner to receive either UVB-irradiated or control, nonirradiated PCs. All patients were given red cells that were white cell reduced by filtration. Transfusion efficacy and alloimmunization were assessed by means of corrected count increments, requirement for red cells and PCs, and measurement of lymphocyte-reactive antibodies. RESULTS: UVB-irradiated PCs had a clinical efficacy similar to controls as judged by corrected count increments at 1 to 6 and 12 to 24 hours and by the median requirement for red cell and platelet transfusions. Alloimmunization determined by measurements of lymphocyte-reactive antibodies using both conventional and antiglobulin-augmented lymphocytotoxicity techniques was not abolished in recipients of UVB-irradiated PCs (4/30, 13%) but was less than that in controls (5/20, 25%; p = NS). The mean number of platelet transfusion episodes prior to the occurrence of alloimmunization was greater in the control group (27 vs. 10; p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: In this trial, UVB irradiation did not diminish the clinical efficacy of platelet transfusions. There was a small but nonsignificant reduction alloimmunization, but no difference in refractoriness of the two groups was observed. Larger prospective randomized studies are required to confirm these findings and to compare UVB irradiation with white cell reduction.","['Blundell, E L', 'Pamphilon, D H', 'Fraser, I D', 'Menitove, J E', 'Greenwalt, T J', 'Snyder, E L', 'Repucci, A J', 'Hedberg, S L', 'Anderson, J K', 'Buchholz, D H', 'Kagen, L R', 'Aster, R H']","['Blundell EL', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Fraser ID', 'Menitove JE', 'Greenwalt TJ', 'Snyder EL', 'Repucci AJ', 'Hedberg SL', 'Anderson JK', 'Buchholz DH', 'Kagen LR', 'Aster RH']","['Regional Transfusion Centre, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36496226140.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1996 Apr;36(4):296-302. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36496226140.x.,,,,['R01 HL013629/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that its N-terminal region (called the POZ-domain), which mediates protein-protein interaction as well as specific nuclear localization of the wild-type PLZF and chimeric PLZF-RARalpha proteins, is primarily responsible for this activity. To further investigate the mechanisms of PLZF-RARalpha action, we have also studied its ligand-receptor, protein-protein, and protein-DNA interaction properties and compared them with those of the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML)-RARalpha, which is expressed in the majority of APLs as a result of t(15;17) translocation. PLZF-RARalpha and PML-RARalpha have essentially the same ligand-binding affinities and can bind in vitro to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) as homodimers or heterodimers with RXRalpha. PLZF-RARalpha homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXRalpha were primarily mediated by the POZ-domain and RARalpha sequence, respectively. Despite having identical RARalpha sequences, PLZF-RARalpha and PML-RARalpha homodimers recognized with different affinities distinct RAREs. Furthermore, PLZF-RARalpha could heterodimerize in vitro with the wild-type PLZF, suggesting that it may play a role in leukemogenesis by antagonizing actions of not only the retinoid receptors but also the wild-type PLZF and possibly other POZ-domain-containing regulators. These different protein-protein interactions and the target gene specificities of PLZF-RARalpha and PML-RARalpha may underlie, at least in part, the apparent resistance of APL with t(11;17) to differentiation effects of all-trans-retinoic acid.","['Dong, S', 'Zhu, J', 'Reid, A', 'Strutt, P', 'Guidez, F', 'Zhong, H J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Licht, J', 'Waxman, S', 'Chomienne, C', 'Chen, Z', 'Zelent, A', 'Chen, S J']","['Dong S', 'Zhu J', 'Reid A', 'Strutt P', 'Guidez F', 'Zhong HJ', 'Wang ZY', 'Licht J', 'Waxman S', 'Chomienne C', 'Chen Z', 'Zelent A', 'Chen SJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Second Medical University (SSMU) Peoples Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (ZBTB6 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1996/04/16 00:00,1996/04/16 00:01,['1996/04/16 00:00'],"['1996/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.8.3624 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 16;93(8):3624-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.8.3624.,,,,['CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC39661,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 prevents its interaction with the transcription factor E2F, which subsequently promotes the expression of S phase regulated genes, such as thymidine kinase. Although a role of p16 in this regulation has been presumed, there is no proof so far that loss of this tumor suppressor gene really affects E2F-mediated regulations. We investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in the p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, MOLT-4 and CEM. Compared to normal lymphocytes, MOLT-4 and CEM cells exhibited an altered cell cycle regulation of thymidine kinase, a much higher intracellular activity of this enzyme, and higher thymidine kinase mRNA expression. Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1, but was without effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells, although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein. Nevertheless, in the two leukemia cell lines transient overexpression of p16 reestablished the normal regulation of thymidine kinase, paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein and decrease of free E2F bound to its motif in the thymidine kinase promoter. We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein.","['Hengstschlager, M', 'Hengstschlager-Ottnad, E', 'Pusch, O', 'Wawra, E']","['Hengstschlager M', 'Hengstschlager-Ottnad E', 'Pusch O', 'Wawra E']","['University of Vienna, Department of Prenatal Diagnosis and Therapy, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/04/18 00:00,1996/04/18 00:01,['1996/04/18 00:00'],"['1996/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Apr 18;12(8):1635-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IRF-1 manifests tumor suppressor activity. Its overexpression results in inhibition of cell growth, and deletions of the IRF-1 gene were demonstrated in a number of human leukemias and myelodysplasias. Although the mechanism by which IRF-1 affects cell growth is unknown, it is believed that IRF-1 activates a set of genes that negatively regulate cell growth. The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which is an interferon-inducible gene, contains a promoter element for the binding of IRF-1 and exhibits antiproliferative properties. Consequently, we investigated the role of IRF-1 in PKR expression. Here, we show that in IRF-1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, PKR expression is reduced relative to wild-type cells. This result predicts diminished expression of PKR as a potential consequence of deletion of the IRF-1 gene in human leukemias. We show that cells of the human leukemic U937 cell line contain a deletion of one IRF-1 gene and express low levels of PKR. We demonstrate that upregulation of IRF-1 expression in U937 cells by transfection is sufficient to induce PKR expression. We also found a marked reduction in the expression of PKR in blood samples from two patients with myelodysplasias, carrying a deletion of chromosome 5q, a locus to which IRF-1 was mapped. These results show that IRF-1 activates PKR expression and suggest that loss of one allele of the IRF-1 gene is sufficient to affect PKR expression. Therefore, PKR is a strong candidate for a mediator of the tumor suppressor activity of IRF-1.","['Beretta, L', 'Gabbay, M', 'Berger, R', 'Hanash, S M', 'Sonenberg, N']","['Beretta L', 'Gabbay M', 'Berger R', 'Hanash SM', 'Sonenberg N']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",1996/04/04 00:00,1996/04/04 00:01,['1996/04/04 00:00'],"['1996/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Apr 4;12(7):1593-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA induced p21 in ML1, K562 and HL60 leukemia cells, whereas OA induced p21 in SW480 and GM4723 carcinoma cells as well as in leukemic cells. In addition, TPA- and serum- but not OA-induced cell cycle arrest was reversed upon return of p21 to basal levels. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying p53-independent regulation of p21, the transcription inhibitor, Actinomycin D (AMD), was used to block p21 expression. The results showed a complete inhibition of p21 mRNA and protein induction by TPA or adriamycin but little effect on p21 mRNA induced by OA in the presence of AMD. These results suggested that TPA-induced p21 expression requires transcription initiation, while a post-transcriptional mechanism may be involved in OA-induction as well. Transient transfection assays with p21 promoter-luciferase reporters and TPA or OA treatment further confirmed that TPA, and to a lesser extent, OA, initiated transcription of p21. Finally, the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, was found to interfere with p21 induction and prevent cell cycle arrest following treatment with TPA but not OA, suggesting a requirement for PKC in TPA activation of p21 expression.","['Zeng, Y X', 'el-Deiry, W S']","['Zeng YX', 'el-Deiry WS']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Medicine, Genetics, and Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Blood', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/04 00:00,1996/04/04 00:01,['1996/04/04 00:00'],"['1996/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Apr 4;12(7):1557-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have determined the mechanism of growth factor independence in several Epo-independent (EI) cell lines established from adult mice previously injected with ED-erythroleukemia cell lines or serially transplanted primary tumor cells. Here we have shown constitutive expression of the Epo gene in 12 of 15 (80%) EI-erythroleukemia cell lines. Among these 12 cell lines, eight were shown to possess clonal rearrangement of the Epo gene which could be detected in the tumors used to establish the majority of these EI-cell lines. Analysis of the pattern of proviral integration revealed that the activation of the Epo gene in these cell lines is independent of retroviral insertional mutagenesis, but apparently the result of genomic rearrangements. Furthermore, the acquisition of growth factor independence by these leukemic cells confers a selective growth advantage in vivo and is associated with enhanced tumorigenicity. Together these observations suggest that the activation of the Epo gene in the large majority of these F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemic cell lines establishes an autocrine loop resulting in the constitutive activation of the Epo receptor signal transduction pathway, thereby conferring a growth and survival advantage in vito and in vitro.","['Howard, J C', 'Berger, L', 'Bani, M R', 'Hawley, R G', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Howard JC', 'Berger L', 'Bani MR', 'Hawley RG', 'Ben-David Y']","['Division of Cancer Biology Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Erythropoietin/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', '*Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neutralization Tests']",1996/04/04 00:00,1996/04/04 00:01,['1996/04/04 00:00'],"['1996/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Apr 4;12(7):1405-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal fusion of the BCR and ABL genes, resulting from the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), is the hallmark of Ph-positive leukemia. We have previously demonstrated that the Bcr protein is tyrosine phosphorylated within first-exon sequences by the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. Here we report that in addition to tyrose 177 (Y-177), Y-360 and Y283 are phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl proteins in vitro. Moreover, Bcr tyrosine 360 is phosphorylated in vivo within both Bcr-Abl and Bcr. Bcr mutant Y177F had a greatly reduced ability to transphosphorylate casein and histone H1, whereas Bcr mutants Y177F and Y283F had wild-type activities. In contrast, the Y360F mutation had little effect on Bcr's autophosphorylation activity. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Bcr, phosphorylated in vitro by Bcr-Abl, was greatly inhibited in its serine/threonine kinase activity, impairing both auto- and transkinase activities of Bcr. Similarly, the isolation of Bcr from cells expressing Bcr-Abl under conditions that preserve phosphotyrosine residues also reduced Bcr's kinase activity. These results indicate that tyrosine 360 of Bcr is critical for the transphosphorylation activity of Bcr and that in Ph-positive leukemia, Bcr serine/threonine kinase activity is seriously impaired.","['Liu, J', 'Wu, Y', 'Ma, G Z', 'Lu, D', 'Haataja, L', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Groffen, J', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Liu J', 'Wu Y', 'Ma GZ', 'Lu D', 'Haataja L', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.3.998 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Mar;16(3):998-1005. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.3.998.,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC231082,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of these regulators and determining the mechanism of how they activate their target genes are important for understanding normal development of monocytes and macrophages and the pathogenesis of a common form of adult acute leukemia, in which the differentiation of monocytic cells is blocked. Our previous work has shown that the monocyte-specific expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor is regulated by three transcription factors interacting with critical regions of the M-CSF receptor promoter, including PU.1 and AML1.PU.1 is essential for myeloid cell development, while the AML1 gene is involved in several common leukemia-related chromosome translocations, although its role in hematopoiesis has not been fully identified. Along with AML1, a third factor, Mono A, interacts with a small region of the promoter which can function as a monocyte-specific enhancer when multimerized and linked to a heterologous basal promoter. Here, we demonstrate by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with monocytic nuclear extracts, COS-7 cell-transfected factors, and specific antibodies that the monocyte-enriched factor Mono A is CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). C/EBP has been shown previously to be an important transcription factor involved in hepatocyte and adipocyte differentiation; in hematopoietic cells, C/EBP is specifically expressed in myeloid cells. In vitro binding analysis reveals a physical interaction between C/EBP and AML1. Further transfection studies show that C/EBP and AML1 in concert with the AML1 heterodimer partner CBF beta synergistically activate M-CSF receptor by more then 60 fold. These results demonstrate that C/EBP and AML1 are important factors for regulating a critical hematopoietic growth factor receptor, the M-CSF receptor, suggesting a mechanism of how the AML1 fusion protein could contribute to acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, they demonstrate physical and functional interactions between AML1 and C/EBP transcription factor family members.","['Zhang, D E', 'Hetherington, C J', 'Meyers, S', 'Rhoades, K L', 'Larson, C J', 'Chen, H M', 'Hiebert, S W', 'Tenen, D G']","['Zhang DE', 'Hetherington CJ', 'Meyers S', 'Rhoades KL', 'Larson CJ', 'Chen HM', 'Hiebert SW', 'Tenen DG']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.3.1231 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Mar;16(3):1231-40. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.3.1231.,,,,"['CA/AI59589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC231105,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report sequence similarities between the Sp100 protein and a putative protein encoded by a highly amplified mouse gene which is visible as an inherited homogeneously staining region (HSR) on chromosome 1 of some mouse populations. By in situ hybridization, the Sp100 gene was mapped to locus 2q37, the syntenic region of the HSR on mouse chromosome 1. Unlike the highly amplified mouse gene, Sp100 was found to be a single-copy gene and showed no restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Sequence similarities in the promoter regions and similar exon-intron organizations of the two genes were revealed. As for Sp100, steady-state levels of the mRNAs of the HSR-encoded genes could be greatly increased by interferon (IFN) treatment.

Topoisomerase II plays a role in the attachment of 50-kilobase domains of DNA to the nuclear matrix; fragments of this size are cleaved during apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced by 50 microM etoposide or 300 mM N-methylformamide (NMF), a nongenotoxic agent. Treatment with etoposide or NMF induced the morphology of apoptosis within 4 hr. Analysis of DNA integrity by electrophoresis showed coincident fragmentation from 50 kb and to integers of 200 bp. Transient protein-associated DNA strand breaks, characteristic of etoposide-induced damage, were visualized as DNA fragments of > 600 kb. Preincubation with ICRF-193 (100 microM) reduced the number of etoposide-induced DNA strand breaks by 50% and delayed the appearance of DNA fragmentation by approximately 18 hr. However, ICRF-193 had no effect on either NMF- or camptothecin-induced DNA fragmentation. The induction of apoptosis by both etoposide and NMF was associated with a reduction in the cellular levels of topoisomerases II alpha and II beta. ICRF-193 inhibited proteolytic cleavage of topoisomerase II induced by etoposide but not by NMF. The data suggest that the activity of topoisomerase II is not required for the cleavage of DNA to 50-kb fragments but that proteolysis of topoisomerase II represents a conserved event of apoptosis.","['Beere, H M', 'Chresta, C M', 'Hickman, J A']","['Beere HM', 'Chresta CM', 'Hickman JA']","['Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Formamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Formamides/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 May;49(5):842-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388 cells synchronized in S and G2/M phases were > 3-fold more sensitive to Dox than were cells in G1 phase (Dox ID50 = 0.50 +/- 0.16 microM in cells synchronized in S phase versus 1.64 +/- 0.12 microM in asynchronized cells; drug exposure, 1 hr). Treatment of synchronized cells in early S phase with 1 microM Dox (2 x ID50) for 1 hr induced a marked cell arrest at G2/M phase at 6-12 hr after drug incubation. We then studied the effect of Dox on the p34cdc2/cyclin B1 complex because it plays a key role in regulating G2/M phase transition. In untreated control P388 cells, p34cdc2 kinase localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasms, particularly in the centrosomes, and p34cdc2 kinase activity is dependent on cell cycle progression, with the enzyme activity increasing steadily from G1/S to G2/M and markedly declining thereafter. Treatment of synchronized P388 cells in early S phase with 1 microM Dox for 1 hr did not affect the pattern of subcellular distribution of the enzyme but completely abrogated its function for > or = 10 hr. In a cell-free system, Dox did not inhibit p34cdc2 kinase activity, indicating that is has no direct effect on the enzyme function. In whole cells, Dox treatment prevented p34cdc2 kinase dephosphorylation without altering its synthesis, and this effect was due to neither down-regulation of cdc25C nor inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. In contrast, Dox treatment was found to induced cyclin B1 accumulation as a result of stimulating its synthesis and inhibiting its degradation. A good correlation was found between extent of DNA double-strand breaks and p34cdc2 kinase activity inhibition. Our results suggest that anthracycline-induced cytotoxicity is cell cycle dependent and is mediated, at least in part, by disturbance of the regulation of p34cdc2/cyclin B1 complex, thus leading to G2/M phase arrest.","['Ling, Y H', 'el-Naggar, A K', 'Priebe, W', 'Perez-Soler, R']","['Ling YH', 'el-Naggar AK', 'Priebe W', 'Perez-Soler R']","['Department of Thoracic@Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. yihevling@isqm.mda.uth.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ccnb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cyclin B', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 May;49(5):832-41.,,,,['CA50270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study was undertaken to further evaluate the contribution of c-jun in apoptosis with the use of two highly specific pharmacological inhibitors of PKC (calphostin C and chelerythrine). To address this issue, two human leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and U937, and a U937 subline stably expressing a dominant negative c-jun mutant (TAM67) were exposed to calphostin C and chelerythrine, and c-jun expression was monitored at both the mRNA and protein levels. Both PKC inhibitors induced the classic morphological features of apoptosis as well as internucleosomal DNA degradation in a concentration- and schedule-dependent manner. Concomitant with these changes, unequivocal increases were observed in c-jun mRNA (U937 and HL-60) and protein (U937). In contrast, up-regulation of c-jun mRNA and protein in TAM67-expressing cells exposed to both PKC inhibitors was markedly attenuated relative to effects observed in parental U937 cells. Importantly, despite impaired up-regulation of c-jun at both the message and protein levels, TAM67-expressing cells were equally susceptible to PKC inhibitor-induced apoptosis as parental and empty vector U937 cells. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that c-jun up-regulation in human myeloid leukemia cells undergoing PKC inhibitor-associated apoptosis represents a response to, rather than a cause of, apoptotic events. They further suggest that this phenomenon involves pathways that do not require PKC activation.","['Freemerman, A J', 'Turner, A J', 'Birrer, M J', 'Szabo, E', 'Valerie, K', 'Grant, S']","['Freemerman AJ', 'Turner AJ', 'Birrer MJ', 'Szabo E', 'Valerie K', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, jun', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Phenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 May;49(5):788-95.,,,,"['CA09564-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NER in CLL lymphocytes was monitored with the use of in vitro biochemical assays, allowing the determination of either the extent of repair synthesis or the incision activity on damaged plasmid DNA during incubation with whole-cell protein extracts. Fresh CLL tumor cells were purified from the blood of 7 untreated patients and 11 patients who had been treated with chemotherapy. No repair activity was found in 14 extracts (7 treated and 7 untreated) or in normal blood peripheral lymphocytes. The defect was at the level of both repair synthesis and incision/excision activity of DNA damage. In contrast, 4 of the extracts exhibited 25-60% of the repair activity measured in an extract from a control repair-proficient cell line. A linear relationship was found between the values of DNA-repair synthesis and incision activities, which indicates that the extent of significant incision was the limiting factor in these protein extracts.

The mechanisms underlying cachexia are largely unknown, and studies in experimental animals have focused mainly on solid tumors. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify and investigate cachexia in experimentally induced T-cell leukemia in the rat. Induction of leukemia by serial passage (injection of cervical lymph node suspension) resulted in a rapid increase in white blood cell (WBC count, hypertrophy of the spleen (by day 11), and severe morbidity within 17 to 18 days. Body weight gain and food intake declined steadily in leukemic animals from day 12, although weight loss was significantly greater in pair-fed, nonleukemic animals. However, leukemic rats had a lower body fat content and higher water content than pair-fed animals on day 18, so the measurement of body weight significantly underestimated the severity of cachexia. Resting oxygen consumption (VO2), measured during the light phase, declined in pair-fed animals from day 13, but was elevated in leukemic rats on days 12 to 18 by 25% (P < .05, one-way ANOVA) compared with pair-fed rats and by 7% (P < .05, one-way ANOVA) relative to free-feeding controls. Hypermetabolism was associated with an increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity (74% and 89%, respectively, P < .05, one-way ANOVA) in leukemic rats compared with control and pair-fed groups. Effects of leukemia on VO2 and BAT were prevented by administration of the adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. These results indicate that T-cell leukemia in the rat results in rapid and severe cachexia, which is largely due to marked hypophagia, but is also accompanied by inappropriately high rates of energy expenditure that are mediated by sympathetic activation of BAT thermogenesis.","['Roe, S', 'Cooper, A L', 'Morris, I D', 'Rothwell, N J']","['Roe S', 'Cooper AL', 'Morris ID', 'Rothwell NJ']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue, Brown/drug effects/metabolism', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cachexia/*etiology', 'Food', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', 'Rats']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0026-0495(96)90037-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0026-0495(96)90037-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1996 May;45(5):645-51. doi: 10.1016/s0026-0495(96)90037-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Nine hundred forty-five women were treated with a 6-week induction course of CMFVP. They were then randomized to receive one of two consolidation CMFVP regimens: 6-week courses or 2-week courses. Following completion of CMFVP consolidation, patients were again randomized to either continue the CMFVP regimen or to receive six escalating doses of VATH. RESULTS: Among all patients, with a median follow-up time of 11.5 years, there is no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between the two consolidation CMFVP regimens. VATH intensification treatment is statistically significantly superior to CMFVP in terms of DFS (P = .0040). For patients with one to three involved nodes, there is currently no significant difference between VATH and CMFVP; however, among those with four or more positive lymph nodes, there is a significant difference in favor of VATH (P = .0037). There is also improved overall survival with VATH (P = .043; median, > 14 years v 10 years). This difference is also statistically significant in patients with four or more involved lymph nodes, among postmenopausal patients, and among postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy with crossover to escalating doses of VATH following CMFVP was well tolerated and effective. Inauguration of VATH as a treatment intensification at the eighth month produced a major increase in relapse-free and overall survival. The observation that sensitivity to VATH is retained so long after mastectomy raises questions about the proper duration of adjuvant chemotherapy and lends support to further investigation of cross-over designs in future trials to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.","['Perloff, M', 'Norton, L', 'Korzun, A H', 'Wood, W C', 'Carey, R W', 'Gottlieb, A', 'Aust, J C', 'Bank, A', 'Silver, R T', 'Saleh, F', 'Canellos, G P', 'Perry, M C', 'Weiss, R B', 'Holland, J F']","['Perloff M', 'Norton L', 'Korzun AH', 'Wood WC', 'Carey RW', 'Gottlieb A', 'Aust JC', 'Bank A', 'Silver RT', 'Saleh F', 'Canellos GP', 'Perry MC', 'Weiss RB', 'Holland JF']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-7329, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', '9JU12S4YFY (Fluoxymesterone)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CMFVP protocol', 'TAVH protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Fluoxymesterone/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Probability', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1589 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1589-98. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1589.,,,,"['CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven assessable children with AML who either had failed to respond to primary induction therapy (group 1, n = 41) or had relapsed (group 2, n = 126) were randomized. RESULTS: Overall, there were 56 complete responses (34%; SE 4%). Among primary refractory patients (group 1), the complete response rate was higher with the three-drug regimen (18% vs 53%, P = .03). In the relapsed patients (group 2), there was no difference in complete response rates related to treatment (31% vs 35%, P = .3). There were 17 early deaths. The major toxicities for both regimens were myelosuppression and infection. CONCLUSION: The overall complete response rate of 34% in this patient population is indicative of effective antileukemic activity. For patients with relapsed leukemia, the addition of azacitidine to etoposide and amsacrine did not improve response. The suggested advantage of the three-drug regimen for induction failures warrants further investigation.","['Steuber, C P', 'Krischer, J', 'Holbrook, T', 'Camitta, B', 'Land, V', 'Sexauer, C', 'Mahoney, D', 'Weinstein, H']","['Steuber CP', 'Krischer J', 'Holbrook T', 'Camitta B', 'Land V', 'Sexauer C', 'Mahoney D', 'Weinstein H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1521 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1521-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1521.,,,,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells from 79 pediatric ALL patients were investigated for inactivation of the p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 9p markers by use of Southern hybridization, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, microsatellite analysis as well as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and nucleotide sequencing of the p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes. Genetic data were correlated to clinical outcome and established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Inactivation of the p15INK4B and/or p16INK4 genes by homozygous deletion or loss of one allele and mutation of the other was detected in 24 cases (30%). Another 12 patients (15%) showed loss of one allele. A statistically significant correlation was found between inactivation of the p15INK4B/p16INK4 genes and poor prognosis (P < .01). Furthermore, inactivation proved to be an independent factor that predicted relapse, ranking second to WBC count. The trend toward overrepresentation of treatment failure was strongest in the high-risk (HR) group patients with p16INK4/p15INK4B gene inactivation. Patients with deletion of genetic material on 9p21 and normal coding sequence of the remaining p16INK4 and p15INK4B genes had a similar prognosis to that of nondeleted cases. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that analysis of p15INK4B/p16INK4 genes may contribute prognostic information in pediatric ALL.","['Heyman, M', 'Rasool, O', 'Borgonovo Brandter, L', 'Liu, Y', 'Grander, D', 'Soderhall, S', 'Gustavsson, G', 'Einhorn, S']","['Heyman M', 'Rasool O', 'Borgonovo Brandter L', 'Liu Y', 'Grander D', 'Soderhall S', 'Gustavsson G', 'Einhorn S']","['Radiumhemmet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Failure']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1512 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1512-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received escalating levels of topotecan systemic exposure as measured by steady-state topotecan lactone concentration (Css). Samples obtained within the first 24 hours were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for topotecan. A two-compartment model was fit to the data using a Bayesian algorithm. Css was calculated for each patient; if it differed by more than 20% of target, a new dosage was begun within 6 hours. Follow-up concentrations were obtained as well as serial plasma samples postinfusion. Toxicity and evidence of activity were assessed after each course. RESULTS: Thirteen boys and five girls received 23 courses of topotecan. Target Css ranged from 1.0 to 5.3 ng/mL (topotecan doses, 0.5 to 3.3 mg/m2/d). Nineteen of 23 courses were within +/- 20% of target after adjustment (range, 77% to 139%). The MTSE was 4.0 ng/mL, and mucositis was exposure-limiting at 5.3 ng/mL. A significant relation between topotecan lactone Css and the severity of mucositis was observed. Myelosuppression was experienced but was not considered exposure-limiting. One complete response and one partial response were noted. CONCLUSION: The MTSE for continuous infusion topotecan was 4.0 ng/mL. Responses were noted at Css comparable to those producing responses in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model. Further studies of topotecan are warranted.","['Furman, W L', 'Baker, S D', 'Pratt, C B', 'Rivera, G K', 'Evans, W E', 'Stewart, C F']","['Furman WL', 'Baker SD', 'Pratt CB', 'Rivera GK', 'Evans WE', 'Stewart CF']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Camptothecin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Topotecan']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1504 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1504-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1504.,,,,"['P01-CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: HCY was assayed by a new method that stabilized the metabolite at bedside. In BU/CY patients (who also received phenytoin), CY clearance was 112% greater (P = .0014), half-life 54% less (P = .0027), peak HCY concentration in plasma/CY dose 113% greater (P = .0006), and the ratio of area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of HCY to CY 166% greater (P = .0116) than in CY/TBI patients. The ratio of the AUC of HCY/CY dose was 48% greater in BU/CY patients than in CY/TBI patients when one CY/TBI patient with an apparent impaired ability to eliminate HCY was excluded from analysis. In CY/TBI patients, there was an inverse correlation between the AUC of HCY and that of CY (R2 = .740, P = .028). Also, the ratio of the AUC of HCY/CY dose was correlated with the average concentration of BU at steady-state (Css, Bu) (R2 = .646, P = 0.29). Variability in CY and HCY pharmacokinetics among the 14 patients overall was pronounced, with the highest variability (15-fold) observed in the ratio of the AUC of HCY to that of CY. CONCLUSION: Prior administration of BU and/or phenytoin significantly alters exposure to CY and HCY. Interpatient variability in HCY exposure at a given CY dose is substantial.","['Slattery, J T', 'Kalhorn, T F', 'McDonald, G B', 'Lambert, K', 'Buckner, C D', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Anasetti, C', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Slattery JT', 'Kalhorn TF', 'McDonald GB', 'Lambert K', 'Buckner CD', 'Bensinger WI', 'Anasetti C', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1484 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1484-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1484.,,,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32165/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with hematologic disorders or breast cancer completed a battery of psychologic and neuropsychologic tests before ABMT, at mid-treatment (1 to 3 days following bone marrow reinfusion), and predischarge (within 1 to 2 days before discharge from the hospital). RESULTS: Analysis of pretransplant data showed significantly higher scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) for patients with hematologic disorders as compared with patients with breast cancer. However, no baseline differences on neuropsychologic measures were found when patients were divided into groups based on prior exposure to cranial radiation and/or intrathecal chemotherapy. Serial evaluations at pretransplant, following return of bone marrow, and at predischarge were available for 34 patients. For the psychologic data, patients with hematologic disorders tended to be more distressed than breast cancer patients at baseline, but became less distressed over time. By contrast, breast cancer patients were relatively less distressed at baseline, demonstrated a significant increase in distress midtreatment, and returned to baseline levels at predischarge assessment. Scores on neuropsychologic measures that assessed higher order cognitive functioning generally worsened over time. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a differential response on psychologic measures when comparing patients with hematologic disorders with those with breast cancer. However, both groups demonstrated a general decline in performance on neuropsychologic measures over the course of treatment.","['Ahles, T A', 'Tope, D M', 'Furstenberg, C', 'Hann, D', 'Mills, L']","['Ahles TA', 'Tope DM', 'Furstenberg C', 'Hann D', 'Mills L']","['Department of Psychiatry, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prospective Studies']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1457 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1457-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Association of the Nordic Cancer Registries and the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology.",1442-6,"PURPOSE: To assess the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms among Hodgkin's disease patients diagnosed before 20 years of age in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 1,641 Hodgkin's disease patients identified through the national cancer registries since the 1940s or 1950s. The patients were monitored for 17,000 person-years until the end of 1991. Expected figures were derived from the age-specific incidence rates in each country and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 62 subsequent neoplasms were diagnosed (SIR, 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 9.9). The overall cumulative risk of subsequent neoplasms was 1.9% at the 10-year follow-up point, 6.9% at 20 years, and 18% at 30 years. There were 26 subsequent neoplasms among males (SIR, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3 to 9.6) and 36 among females (SIR, 8.9; 95% CI, 6.2 to 12), of which 16 were breast cancers (SIR, 17; 95% CI, 9.9 to 28). High risks were seen for thyroid cancer (SIR, 33; 95% CI, 15 to 62), for secondary leukemia (SIR, 17; 95% CI, 6.9 to 35), and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR, 15; 95% CI, 4.9 to 35). The relative risk increased from 3.3 (95% CI, 1.2 to 7.1) for Hodgkin's disease patients diagnosed in the 1940s and 1950s to 15 (95% CI, 7.4 to 27) in the 1980s. The highest risk of secondary leukemia (SIR, 68; 95% CI, 18 to 174) was seen among those diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in the 1980s. CONCLUSION: Patients who survive Hodgkin's disease at a young age are at very high relative risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms throughout their lives. In particular, the high relative risk of breast cancer following Hodgkin's disease in the teenage years calls for enhanced activity for early diagnosis.","['Sankila, R', 'Garwicz, S', 'Olsen, J H', 'Dollner, H', 'Hertz, H', 'Kreuger, A', 'Langmark, F', 'Lanning, M', 'Moller, T', 'Tulinius, H']","['Sankila R', 'Garwicz S', 'Olsen JH', 'Dollner H', 'Hertz H', 'Kreuger A', 'Langmark F', 'Lanning M', 'Moller T', 'Tulinius H']","['Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1442 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1442-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1442.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1982 to September 1990, 427 consecutive previously untreated patients with pathologic stage IB, IIA bulky, IIB, III (A and B), and IV (A and B) disease were prospectively randomized to receive two different sequences of MOPP and ABVD for a minimum of six cycles followed by radiotherapy (median dose, 30 Gy) to the nodal site(s) of pretreatment bulky disease. Of 415 assessable patients, 211 received one cycle of MOPP monthly, alternated with one cycle of ABVD (alternating regimen), and 204 patients received one-half cycle of MOPP alternated with one-half cycle of ABVD within a 1-month period (hybrid regimen). RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate was 91% with the alternating regimen and 89% with the hybrid regimen. At 10 years, the freedom-from-progression (FFP) rate was 67% versus 69% and the overall survival (OS) rate was 74% versus 72%, respectively. After attainment of CR, 85 patients relapsed in nodal (n = 60) versus extranodal with or without nodal (n = 25) sites. In patients given consolidative radiation because of bulky lymphoma, the true recurrence rate was 13%. A total of 23 second malignancies (6%) were documented, including 11 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

The report also highlights key informational deficiencies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in second complete remission (2CR) and those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (1CR) were assigned to BMT or control groups solely on the availability of a suitable donor. All hospital-borne costs were estimated, based on services used according to manual chart review, in four categories: diagnostic and therapeutic costs, professional fees, drug costs, and ward costs. Incremental costs and incremental life-years were calculated, and the quotient determined a cost per life-year gained by BMT for AML (2CR) and ALL (1CR). RESULTS: The incremental cost (in 1992 Canadian dollars) per life-year gained by BMT (cost-effectiveness) for AML (2CR) was $29,200; and for ALL (1CR) it was minus $29,200. CONCLUSION: For AML (2CR), allogeneic BMT creates better outcomes than standard treatment, but is more costly. For ALL (1CR), both the costs and outcomes are similar for BMT and standard therapy. Quality adjustments made to life-years gained did not change these conclusions.","['Barr, R', 'Furlong, W', 'Henwood, J', 'Feeny, D', 'Wegener, J', 'Walker, I', 'Brain, M']","['Barr R', 'Furlong W', 'Henwood J', 'Feeny D', 'Wegener J', 'Walker I', 'Brain M']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*therapy', 'Life Expectancy', 'Models, Economic', 'Ontario', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1413 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1413-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.5.1413.,['J Clin Oncol. 1996 May;14(5):1409-10.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced malignancies were eligible. There were two treatment cycles; during cycle 1, patients received 2-CdA solution at 0.28 mg/kg/d orally under fasting conditions for 5 consecutive days concomitantly with omeprazole, and 4 weeks later during cycle 2 patients received 2-CdA as a 2-hour IV infusion of 0.14 mg/kg/d for 5 consecutive days. Serial blood samples for 2-CdA plasma levels were obtained after drug administrations on days 1 and 5 during each treatment cycle. RESULTS: Ten patients completed cycles 1 and 2. The F value of oral 2-CdA measured on days 1 and 5 was 37.2% and 36.7%, respectively. For both oral and IV multiple administrations, there was no significant accumulation in maximum concentration (Cmax), and the intersubject variabilities (coefficient of variation [CV], approximately 40%) in Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] values were comparable for both routes on days 1 and 5. A three-compartment open model was applied to the plasma concentration data after oral and IV administrations and resulted in good agreement between observed and simulated concentration-time profiles. Neutropenia was the principal adverse event observed when 2-CdA was administered orally and IV. CONCLUSION: The F value of 2-CdA after oral administration was approximately 37% and there were no cumulative differences in bioavailability observed on multiple dosing of the drug. The absorption and disposition characteristics of oral 2-CdA were linear and predictable with this dosing regimen.","['Saven, A', 'Cheung, W K', 'Smith, I', 'Moyer, M', 'Johannsen, T', 'Rose, E', 'Gollard, R', 'Kosty, M', 'Miller, W E', 'Piro, L D']","['Saven A', 'Cheung WK', 'Smith I', 'Moyer M', 'Johannsen T', 'Rose E', 'Gollard R', 'Kosty M', 'Miller WE', 'Piro LD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.3.978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Mar;14(3):978-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.3.978.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of protocol ALL VI from the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group.,911-8,"PURPOSE: Here we report the results of a nationwide cooperative study in the Netherlands on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. The aim of the study was to improve the cure rate and to minimize side effects in a group of non-high-risk ALL patients, especially with regard to the CNS. A second aim was to study potential prognostic factors. METHODS: Children (age 0 to 15 years) with non-high-risk ALL (WBC count < 50 x 10(9)/L, no mediastinal mass, no B-cell phenotype, and no CNS involvement) were treated with a uniform protocol, ALL VI. The treatment protocol used 6-week induction regimen with three drugs (vincristine, dexamethasone, and asparaginase), three weekly doses of intravenous (IV) medium high-dose methotrexate (2 g/m2), and 2-year maintenance therapy that consisted of alternating 5-week periods of methotrexate and mercaptopurine and 2-week periods of vincristine and dexamethasone. In the first year of maintenance, triple intrathecal therapy was administered every 7 weeks. RESULTS: From December 1, 1984 until July 1, 1988, 291 children with ALL were diagnosed; 206 were categorized as non-high-risk (71%), and 190 were treated according to protocol ALL VI. At 8 years, the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 81% (SE = 3%) and survival rate 85% (SE = 2.9%); the median follow-up time was 7.3 years (range, 36 to 117 months). The CNS relapse rate was 1.1% (two of 184 patients who achieved a complete remission [CR]). The only factor found to be of negative prognostic importance in terms of EFS (P = .05) was a positive acid phosphatase reaction. CONCLUSION: For children with non-high-risk ALL, the combination of IV medium high-dose methotrexate (2 g/m2 times three), triple intrathecal therapy in the first year of maintenance treatment, and the use of dexamethasone for induction and pulses during maintenance treatment has proved to be highly effective, especially in the prevention of CNS relapse. A high cure rate was achieved without the use of anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and cranial irradiation.","['Veerman, A J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Kamps, W A', 'Van Leeuwen, E F', 'De Vaan, G A', 'Solbu, G', 'Suciu, S', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Van der Does-Van der Berg, A']","['Veerman AJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Kamps WA', 'Van Leeuwen EF', 'De Vaan GA', 'Solbu G', 'Suciu S', 'Van Wering ER', 'Van der Does-Van der Berg A']","['Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group, Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.3.911 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Mar;14(3):911-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.3.911.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD11c/CD18 is expressed primarily on cells of the myeloid lineage and activated B lymphocytes, and is an important diagnostic marker for hairy cell leukemia. To identify the transcription factors and cis-acting elements involved in the regulated expression of CD11c/CD18 during myeloid cell differentiation and B lymphocyte activation, we have performed structural and functional analysis on the CD11c gene promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified an AP-1 binding site (AP1-60) within the proximal promoter region and evidenced differences in the pattern of the Fos family members bound to the AP1-60 element in undifferentiated and differentiated myeloid cells, as well as between B lineage-derived cells. The involvement of the AP1-60 element in DNA-protein interactions was confirmed by means of in vivo footprinting experiments, and its functionality was demonstrated by trans activation of the CD11c promoter by c-Jun. Site-directed mutagenesis of AP1-60 greatly reduced the basal CD11c promoter activity in myeloid and B cells. Furthermore, mutations at AP1-60 inhibited the induction of the CD11c promoter activity during the PMA-triggered U937 cell differentiation, pointing out a key role for the AP-1 transcription factor complex in both the basal and the developmentally regulated expression of the p150,95 leukocyte integrin. The involvement of AP-1 in the transcription of the CD11c gene raises the possibility of altering leukocyte integrin expression by pharmacologic means and will greatly contribute to the characterization of the intracellular signals controlling the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules.","['Lopez-Rodriguez, C', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Corbi, A L']","['Lopez-Rodriguez C', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Corbi AL']","['Hospital of the Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/drug effects/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 15;156(10):3780-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that both CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ thymocytes proliferate after stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of cultured thymic epithelial cells. Costimulation of CD4+ thymocytes by thymic epithelial cells is partly inhibited by an anti-CD40 mAb, but this mAb has no effect on costimulation of CD8+ thymocytes. The selective costimulatory ability of CD40 for CD4+ thymocytes was confirmed in experiments in which thymocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence of murine P815 cells transfected with CD40 cDNA. The level of costimulation induced by P815-CD40 was comparable with that induced by P815 cells expressing CD80 (B7.1). Treatment of thymocytes with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and the phorbol ester PMA or with anti-CD3 mAb resulted in up-regulation of the CD40 ligand, suggesting that this molecule is involved in CD40-mediated costimulation of human thymocytes. Costimulation of thymocytes by CD80 strongly increased anti-CD3-induced death of fetal thymocytes. In contrast, costimulation by CD40 did not increase anti-CD3-mediated apoptosis of these thymocytes. To confirm that CD40 does not affect anti-CD3-induced cell death, we established a variant of the Jurkat T leukemic cell line that constitutively expresses CD40L and analyzed the sensitivity of this cell line for activation-induced apoptosis. In contrast to CD80, CD40 failed to increase anti-CD3-mediated apoptosis in CD40L+ Jurkat cells, whereas both CD40 and CD80 strongly increased IL-2 production induced by anti-CD3. These findings suggest that costimulation by CD40 is involved in clonal expansion of CD4+ thymocytes but not in activation-induced cell death.","['Ruggiero, G', 'Martinez Caceres, E', 'Voordouw, A', 'Noteboom, E', 'Graf, D', 'Kroczek, R A', 'Spits, H']","['Ruggiero G', 'Martinez Caceres E', 'Voordouw A', 'Noteboom E', 'Graf D', 'Kroczek RA', 'Spits H']","['Division of Immunology of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism/*physiology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epithelium/immunology/metabolism', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 15;156(10):3737-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conjugation of HPB-ALL human leukemia cells with cell-sized beads coated with anti-TCR mAb causes a stronger, more sustained Ca2+ response than that produced by the soluble form of the same mAb. Addition of a large excess of the soluble mAb subsequent to stimulation with the beads causes a marked reduction in the response of the bead-conjugated cells, but only limited disruption of the conjugates. Free (nonconjugated) cells, sampled simultaneously in this mixture, respond to the soluble mAb with a transient Ca2+ increase that declines with the same kinetics as the bead-conjugated cells after addition of the soluble mAb. Fab fragments of the anti-TCR mAb cause a similar reduction in the response of the bead-conjugated cells, and they do not stimulate free cells. Following the Fab-mediated decline in cytoplasmic Ca2+ of conjugated cells to near-baseline concentrations, the addition of a second, noncompetitive, anti-TCR mab causes a Ca2+ response that is substantially reduced in magnitude compared with that for the free cells. The results indicate that soluble and surface-attached ligands cause TCR-specific desensitization of the Ca2+ response. Surface-attached ligands are more effective than soluble ligands in sustaining signaling in T cells at least in part because they facilitate steady association and/or reassociation of TCR into the bound state in the surface contact area.","['Hashemi, B B', 'Slattery, J P', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Hashemi BB', 'Slattery JP', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Aluminum Compounds)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'Z77H3IKW94 (aluminum fluoride)']",IM,"['Aluminum Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Fluorides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Microspheres', 'Receptor Aggregation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 15;156(10):3660-7.,,,,"['AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08267/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 51p1 gene locus is highly polymorphic, consisting of 13 alleles that can be classified as being either 51p1-related or hy1263-related, based on distinctive sequence motifs in the second complementarity determining region. Two of the 51p1-related genes usually occur as a linked pair on the same haopltype, resulting from gene duplication. Consequently, a person can have a total of zero to four copies of 51p1-related genes. These genes are detectable in genomic DNA by sequence-specific RFLP analysis using oligonucleotide probes. Ig encoded by nonmutated 51p1-related genes can be detected by G6, a murine antiidiotypic mAb. We have now studied lymphocytes from 35 human tonsils to examine the relation between the number of 51p1-related germlime gene copies and the proportion of IgD-bearing tonsillar B cells that react with G6. All subjects who had zero copies of 51p1-related genes lacked any G6-reactive B cells, whereas those with four copies of 51p1-related genes had the highest proportions of G6-positive IgD B cells, up to 11.4%. Subjects with intermediate gene doses had intermediate proportions of G6-reactive B cells. Over the entire data set, the percentage of IgD-bearing B cells that reacted with G6 was proportional to the 51p1-related gene copy number (r = 0.92, p < 0.001), with each copy accounting for 2.4-4.0% of the IgD-bearing B cells. We conclude that 51p1-related genes are expressed by a relatively large percentage of IgD+ tonsillar B cells and this percentage is proportional to the germline copy number of 51p1-related genes.","['Sasso, E H', 'Johnson, T', 'Kipps, T J']","['Sasso EH', 'Johnson T', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Rheumatology, University of Washington, Seattle 98105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Gene Dosage', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Palatine Tonsil/*immunology/pathology', 'Tonsillitis/immunology/pathology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118644 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 May 1;97(9):2074-80. doi: 10.1172/JCI118644.,,,,"['AR40561/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA49870-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05432/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC507282,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of STAT pathway.,1852-9,"We recently described the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in human fetal and murine corticotrophs. LIF and the related cytokine oncostatin M induced basal, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) induced proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and ACTH secretion in AtT20 cells. LIF signaling and regulation of POMC gene transcription were therefore tested. Dexamethasone inhibited both basal- and LIF-induced ACTH secretion (P<0.05) and LIF induction of ACTH was also attenuated by immuneutralization of either the LIF receptor (35%, P<0.05) or the gp130 affinity converter (41%, P<0.05). These antisera also attenuated basal ACTH secretion in the absence of added ligand (P<0.05). To examine intrapituitary LIF signaling, phosphorylation of post-receptor substrates was measured. 1 nM LIF rapidly induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT 1 and STAT 3 proteins, as well as tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 115-kD protein, coimmunoprecipitated with STAT 1. The transfected rat POMC promoter -706/+64, fused to the luciferase reporter gene, was induced by LIF, which exerted strong (18-fold) synergy with CRH. Deletion of the major CRH responsive region in POMC (-323/-166) abolished CRH induction of transcription and severely limited LIF synergy. Although 8 bromo cAMP or forskolin modestly enhanced POMC transcription (2.8-fold), LIF markedly potentiated (7.4-fold) these cAMP activators. These results demonstrate that corticotroph LIF action is receptor mediated and involves activation of STAT signaling pathways. LIF potently synergizes with both CRH and cAMP induction of POMC transcription. This novel intrapituitary signaling mechanism may mediate a neuroimmune pituitary interface.","['Ray, D W', 'Ren, S G', 'Melmed, S']","['Ray DW', 'Ren SG', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Pituitary Gland/metabolism', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118615 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Apr 15;97(8):1852-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI118615.,,,,['DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC507253,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that both thrombin and a synthetic peptide ligand for the thrombin receptor (sequence SFLLRN) caused phosphorylation and heterologous desensitization of the receptors for C5a, IL-8, and PAF but not that for formylpeptides as measured by agonist-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to membranes. Consistent with the PAF receptor phosphorylation, both thrombin and thrombin receptor peptide inhibited phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and degranulation stimulated by PAF. Unexpectedly, despite heterologous desensitization at the level of receptor/G protein activation, there was enhancement (""priming"") by thrombin of subsequent activities stimulated by C5a and IL-8 as well as fMLP. The priming effect of thrombin was blocked by its inhibitor, hirudin. However, two other activators of the thrombin receptor, the peptide SFLLRN and trypsin, stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells but did not cause priming. In addition, SFLLRN and the thrombin receptor antagonist peptide FLLRN both inhibited thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization but not priming. Furthermore, the proteolytically active gamma-thrombin, which does not stimulate the tethered ligand thrombin receptor and caused little or no Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells, effectively primed the response to fMLP. These data demonstrate that heterologous receptor phosphorylation and attenuation of G protein activation are not, by themselves, sufficient for the inhibition of biological responses mediated by C5a and IL-8. Moreover, thrombin appears to utilize mechanism(s) independent of its tethered ligand receptor to selectively prime phospholipase C-mediated biological responses of the C5a, IL-8, and formylpeptide receptors but not PAF. Because C5a, IL-8, and formylpeptide activate phospholipase Cbeta2, whereas PAF stimulates a different phospholipase C, the striking selectivity of thrombin's priming may be mediated via its ability to enhance receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase Cbeta2.","['Ali, H', 'Tomhave, E D', 'Richardson, R M', 'Haribabu, B', 'Snyderman, R']","['Ali H', 'Tomhave ED', 'Richardson RM', 'Haribabu B', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '0 (thrombin receptor peptide (42-47))', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Receptors, Peptide/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sequence Tagged Sites', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",1996/02/09 00:00,1996/02/09 00:01,['1996/02/09 00:00'],"['1996/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.6.3200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)97998-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Feb 9;271(6):3200-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.6.3200.,,,,"['CA-29589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-29589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the similarities in the B and T lymphocyte antigen receptors, and the induction of pre-B leukemias in mice by the v-cbl oncogene, we examined the potential involvement of Cbl in B cell receptor signaling. We demonstrate prominent and early tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl upon stimulation of human B cell lines through surface IgM. Cbl was associated in vivo with Fyn and, to a lesser extent, other Src family kinases. B cell activation also induced a prominent association of Cbl with Syk tyrosine kinase. A substantial fraction of Cbl was constitutively associated with Grb2 and this interaction was mediated by Grb2 SH3 domains. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, which prominently associated with Grb2, was detected in association with Cbl in activated B cells. Thus, Grb2 and Shc adaptors, which associate with immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs, may link Cbl to the B cell receptor. B cell activation also induced a prominent association between Cbl and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase resulting in the association of a substantial fraction of PI 3-kinase activity with Cbl. Thus, Cbl is likely to play an important role to couple the B cell receptor to the PI 3-kinase pathway. Our results strongly suggest a role for p120cbl in signaling downstream of the B cell receptor and support the idea that Cbl participates in a general signal transduction function downstream of the immune cell surface receptors.","['Panchamoorthy, G', 'Fukazawa, T', 'Miyake, S', 'Soltoff, S', 'Reedquist, K', 'Druker, B', 'Shoelson, S', 'Cantley, L', 'Band, H']","['Panchamoorthy G', 'Fukazawa T', 'Miyake S', 'Soltoff S', 'Reedquist K', 'Druker B', 'Shoelson S', 'Cantley L', 'Band H']","[""Lymphocyte Biology Section, Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-cbl)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fyn protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein v-cbl', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', '*src Homology Domains']",1996/02/09 00:00,1996/02/09 00:01,['1996/02/09 00:00'],"['1996/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.6.3187 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)97996-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Feb 9;271(6):3187-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.6.3187.,,,,"['R01 GM041890/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR36308/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM36624/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of the hydrophilic C terminus of MTP, which encompassed two putative signal motifs for intracellular localization (Tyr-X-X-hydrophobic amino acid), allowed expression of recombinant protein (MTP deltaC) in plasma membranes of Xenopus laevis oocytes. MTP deltaC-expressing oocytes exhibited greater fragility than nonexpressing oocytes, and those that survived the experimental manipulations were capable of mediated uptake of thymidine, uridine, and adenosine.

In most contexts, Tax is a potent gene activator. Here, we describe an unexpected finding of Myc repression by Tax. In cells that overexpress human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax, the detection of c-Myc protein in the nucleus by a monoclonal antibody was masked. Tax prevented immunological visualization of a Myc epitope contained within amino acids 45-104, resulting in interference with Myc function in transcription and in anchorage-independent cell growth. Tax did not affect steady-state protein levels since detection of c-Myc with other antibodies was unperturbed. Four observations suggest that this Tax-Myc interaction is mediated through CREB/ATF signal transduction. 1) Tax point mutants, selectively defective for activation of CREB/ATF but not NF-kappaB, failed to mask c-Myc; 2) masking of Myc was abolished when Tax-expressing cells were treated with protein kinase inhibitor H-9; 3) Tax-specific shielding of Myc is absent in cells (B1R) that are genetically defective for cAMP signaling; and 4) forskolin treatment of cells mimicked Tax in masking the Myc epitope.

Peroxidase-negative neutrophils from many patients with hereditary MPO deficiency possess a 90-kDa MPO-related protein. We recently identified a missense mutation, R569W, in the MPO gene of many subjects with MPO deficiency. In these studies we examined the consequences of R569W on MPO biosynthesis and processing, using stably transfected K562 cells expressing normal MPO or the R569W mutation. K562 cells expressing normal MPO mimicked faithfully many features of MPO biosynthesis in myeloid cells. 1) apopro-MPO was synthesized; 2) a functional heme group was inserted into apopro-MPO, and enzymatically active pro-MPO was thereby generated; 3) pro-MPO underwent proteolytic processing to mature MPO; and 4) hemin augmented the processing of pro-MPO. pREP-R569W cells synthesized apopro-MPO, but heme was not inserted. Neither enzymatically active pro-MPO nor mature MPO was synthesized by transfectants expressing mutated cDNA, confirming our hypothesis that the R569W mutation results in a form of apopro-MPO which does not undergo post-translational processing to enzymatically active MPO species. In addition, these data support previous suggestions that heme insertion into apopro-MPO is necessary for its subsequent proteolytic processing into mature MPO subunits.","['Nauseef, W M', 'Cogley, M', 'McCormick, S']","['Nauseef WM', 'Cogley M', 'McCormick S']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/physiology', 'Peroxidase/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1996/04/19 00:00,1996/04/19 00:01,['1996/04/19 00:00'],"['1996/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.16.9546 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)31371-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 19;271(16):9546-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.16.9546.,,,,"['I01 BX000513/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'AI-28412/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assembly of sarcomeric units in series VIA gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-dependent pathways.,9535-45,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) was recently isolated by expression cloning based on its ability to induce an increase in cell size in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Sequence similarity data suggested that CT-1 is a novel member of a family of structurally related cytokines sharing the receptor component gp130. The present study documents that gp130 is required for CT-1 signaling in cardiomyocytes, by demonstrating that a monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody completely inhibits c-fos induction by CT-1. Similarly, a leukemia inhibitory factor receptor subunit beta (LIFRbeta) antagonist effectively blocks the CT-1 induction of c-fos, indicating a requirement for LIFRbeta in the hypertrophic response, as well. Upon stimulation with CT-1, both gpl30 and the LIFRbeta are tyrosine-phosphorylated, providing further evidence that CT-1 signals through the gp130/LIFRbeta heterodimer in cardiomyocytes. CT-1 induces a hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes that is distinct from the phenotype seen after alpha-adrenergic stimulation, both with regard to cell morphology and gene expression pattern. Stimulation with CT-1 results in an increase in cardiac cell size that is characterized by an increase in cell length but no significant change in cell width. Confocal laser microscopy of CT-1 stimulated cells reveals the assembly of sarcomeric units in series rather than in parallel, as seen after alpha-adrenergic stimulation. CT-1 induces a distinct pattern of immediate early genes, and up-regulates the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, but does not affect skeletal alpha-actin or myosin light chain-2v expression. As evidenced by nuclear run-on transcription assays, both CT-1 and alpha-adrenergic stimulation lead to an increase in ANF gene transcription. Transient transfection analyses document that, in contrast to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, the CT-1 responsive cis-regulatory elements are located outside of the proximal 3 kilobase pairs of the ANF 5'-flanking region. These studies indicate that CT-1 can activate a distinct form of myocardial cell hypertrophy, characterized by the promotion of sarcomere assembly in series, via gpl30/LIFRbeta-dependent signaling pathways.","['Wollert, K C', 'Taga, T', 'Saito, M', 'Narazaki, M', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Glembotski, C C', 'Vernallis, A B', 'Heath, J K', 'Pennica, D', 'Wood, W I', 'Chien, K R']","['Wollert KC', 'Taga T', 'Saito M', 'Narazaki M', 'Kishimoto T', 'Glembotski CC', 'Vernallis AB', 'Heath JK', 'Pennica D', 'Wood WI', 'Chien KR']","['Department of Medicine, Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/*cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sarcomeres/drug effects/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",1996/04/19 00:00,1996/04/19 00:01,['1996/04/19 00:00'],"['1996/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.16.9535 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)31370-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 19;271(16):9535-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.16.9535.,,,,"['1 RO1 HL51549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53773/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL46345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that UV light and chemotherapeutic drugs including adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatin increased poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, particularly histone H1. A poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, prevented both internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in cells treated with the apoptosis inducers. When nuclear chromatin was made accessible to the exogenous nuclease in a permeabilized cell system, chromatin of UV-treated cells was more susceptible to micrococcal nuclease than the chromatin of control cells. Suppression of histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by 3-aminobenzamide reduced the micrococcal nuclease digestibility of internucleosomal chromatin in UV-treated cells. These results suggest that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 correlates with the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis mediated by DNA damaging agents. This suggestion is supported by the finding that xeroderma pigmentosum cells which are defective in introducing incision at the site of DNA damage, failed to induce DNA fragmentation as well as histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation after UV irradiation. We propose that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 protein in the early stage of apoptosis facilitates internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by increasing the susceptibility of chromatin to cellular endonuclease.","['Yoon, Y S', 'Kim, J W', 'Kang, K W', 'Kim, Y S', 'Choi, K H', 'Joe, C O']","['Yoon YS', 'Kim JW', 'Kang KW', 'Kim YS', 'Choi KH', 'Joe CO']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, 305-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/chemistry', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1996/04/12 00:00,1996/04/12 00:01,['1996/04/12 00:00'],"['1996/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.15.9129 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)35513-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 12;271(15):9129-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.15.9129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell antigen receptor ubiquitination was evaluated in Jurkat, a well characterized human T leukemia cell line. Treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A resulted in an inhibition of receptor ubiquitination. Consistent with this, pervanadate, which increases cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, enhanced receptor ubiquitination. A requirement for receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activity for ubiquitination was confirmed in cells lacking the tyrosine kinase p56lck and also in cells that are defective in expression of CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that regulates the activity of p56lck. The need for tyrosine kinase activation for ubiquitination was not bypassed by directly activating protein kinase C and stimulating endocytosis of receptors. These observations establish ubiquitination of the T cell antigen receptor as a tyrosine kinase-dependent manifestation of transmembrane signaling and suggest a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the ligand-dependent ubiquitination of mammalian transmembrane receptors.","['Cenciarelli, C', 'Wilhelm, K G Jr', 'Guo, A', 'Weissman, A M']","['Cenciarelli C', 'Wilhelm KG Jr', 'Guo A', 'Weissman AM']","['Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1152, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1996/04/12 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/04/12 00:00'],"['1996/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.15.8709 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)35452-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Apr 12;271(15):8709-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.15.8709.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have identified a complex and heterogeneous pattern of expression of mRNA transcripts for this receptor in normal mouse tissues and cell lines. In order to understand the molecular basis of these transcripts, genomic clones encompassing the region of divergence from the soluble to the membrane-bound form of the receptor were isolated. cDNAs encoding the membrane-bound form of the mLIFR were generated by an alternative splicing event where an exon that is specific to the soluble mLIFR was skipped. The membrane-bound form of the mLIFR was heterogeneously polyadenylated with at least five different sites of polyadenylation. The mRNA transcript encoding the soluble form of the mLIFR contained a region highly homologous to a murine B2 repetitive element, thus providing a possible explanation for the genesis of this transcript. The different forms of the mLIFR were analyzed in a wide range of mouse tissues in pseudopregnant mice and in mice at various stages of pregnancy. Only liver, placenta, and uterus showed an increase in the levels of mLIFR mRNA expression during pregnancy, indicating an important role for the LIFR in this process.

Biodistribution, tumor targeting, and toxicity studies were performed using varying doses of 212Pb-DOTA-103A.

RESULTS: Biodistribution studies showed marked tumor targeting (58% ID/g spleen) in mice treated with 203Pb-103A as compared with mice treated with control antibody B3 (4.6% ID/g spleen). Histologic cure was achieved in all leukemic mice treated with 20 muCi212Pb-103A; however, all of the mice died with leukopenia and secondary++ bacterial infections due to severe bone marrow toxicity. Nonleukemic mice and mice treated with 20 muCi212Pb-B3 experienced less marrow toxicity and longer survival. Coadministration of the heavy metal chelator did not diminish the bone marrow toxicity.

During short-term incubation (24 hr) Act D produced dose-dependent cytostatic/cytotoxic effects against MmB16, LL/2 and L1 tumor cells but did not reduce the viability of these cells even at high concentration (10 micrograms/ml), below a threshold of 30-60%. However, L1210 leukemic cells were highly susceptible to Act D, and no viable cells were detected in cultures incubated with 1 microgram/ml of Act D. TNF-alpha alone, when used under the same culture conditions, had only a negligible effect on all cell lines tested. However, the combination of this cytokine with Act D produced synergistic cytotoxic effects against MmB16, LL/2 and L1 cells but not against L1210 leukemia cells. In an in vivo model of regional therapy in which tumor-bearing mice were treated with Act D and TNF-alpha, a correlation with in vitro results was observed. In mice bearing MmB16 melanoma, LL/2 carcinoma and L1 sarcoma, the most potent anti-tumor effects were observed in mice treated with Act D and TNF-alpha together. This treatment led to a delay of tumor growth and induced complete tumor regression in some cases. On the contrary, TNF-alpha did not enhance the effect of Act D in mice injected with L1210 leukemia cells. Our results show that TNF-alpha can potentiate the anti-tumor effects of Act D against tumors weakly susceptible to Act D and may be a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy in the local treatment of neoplasia.","['Lasek, W', 'Giermasz, A', 'Kuc, K', 'Wankowicz, A', 'Feleszko, W', 'Golab, J', 'Zagozdzon, R', 'Stoklosa, T', 'Jakobisiak, M']","['Lasek W', 'Giermasz A', 'Kuc K', 'Wankowicz A', 'Feleszko W', 'Golab J', 'Zagozdzon R', 'Stoklosa T', 'Jakobisiak M']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Biostructure Medical School, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Dactinomycin/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",1996/05/03 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/03 00:00'],"['1996/05/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<374::AID-IJC18>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<374::AID-IJC18>3.0.CO;2-B [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 May 3;66(3):374-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<374::AID-IJC18>3.0.CO;2-B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In earlier studies we presented data which indicated that sphingosine (Sph) itself was increased during apoptosis induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in HL60 cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in neutrophils, and when added exogenously was able to induce apoptosis. We report here that Sph and its methylated derivative N,N,-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) are able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells of both hematopoietic and carcinoma origin. In human leukemic cell lines CMK-7, HL60 and U937, treatment with 20 microM Sph for 6 hr caused apoptosis in up to 90% of cells. Human colonic carcinoma cells HT29, HRT18, MKN74 and COLO205 were shown to be more susceptible to apoptosis upon addition of DMS (>50%) than of Sph (<50%), yet were weakly or not sensitive to N,N,N-trimethylsphingosine (TMS). Under the same conditions, in the presence of serum, neither Sph-1-phosphate nor ceramide analogues C2-, C6- or C8-ceramide were able to induce apoptosis in any cell lines. However, in the absence of serum, ceramide analogues induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines after 18 hr, yet much less so than Sph or DMS. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by Sph or DMS could not be inhibited by the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1. Apoptosis was not induced by sphingolipids in primary culture cells, such as HUVEC or rat mesangial cells, but was apparent in transformed rat mesangial cells. Additionally, apoptosis induced by Sph, DMS or C2Cer was inhibited by protease inhibitors. Our data further support the evidence that the catabolic pathway of sphingomyelin involving Sph and other metabolites is an integral part of the apoptosis pathway.","['Sweeney, E A', 'Sakakura, C', 'Shirahama, T', 'Masamune, A', 'Ohta, H', 'Hakomori, S', 'Igarashi, Y']","['Sweeney EA', 'Sakakura C', 'Shirahama T', 'Masamune A', 'Ohta H', 'Hakomori S', 'Igarashi Y']","['The Biomembrane Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, 98119, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glomerular Mesangium', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Rats', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins']",1996/05/03 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/03 00:00'],"['1996/05/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<358::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<358::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 May 3;66(3):358-66. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960503)66:3<358::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,['CA-42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the U-266 cell line, the growth-inhibitory effects of antibodies (Abs) against IL-6 and IL-6-binding subunit of its receptor were compared with each other. From our results the following conclusions may be drawn: (i) Substantial differences in the quantificative assembly of the IL-6r constituents and in the response to recombinant (r) human (h) IL-6 became evident in the 7 myeloma cell lines. (ii) The components of an autocrine IL-6 loop may be regulated in an independent and, in the case of IL-6 and sgp-55, probably counteractive manner. (iii) The level of endogenous IL-6 and the reservoir of recruitable sgp-55 were important for the response to exogenous rhIL-6. (iv) Apart from IL-6, other growth factors are important for the propagation of myeloma cells but at least some of them exert their effect through an IL-6-dependent pathway.

The receptor complex for LIF comprises LIF-binding subunit and non-binding signal transducer, gp130. The gp130 was originally identified as a signal-transducing subunit of interleukin (IL)-6 and later also found to be a functional component of receptor complexes for other LIF-related cytokines (oncostatin M [OSM], ciliary neurotrophic factor [CNTF] and IL-11). In this study, we have analyzed the functional role of gp130-mediated signaling in PGC growth in vitro. OSM was able to fully substitute for LIF; both cytokines promoted the proliferation of migratory PGC (mPGC) and enhanced the viability of postmigratory (colonizing) PGC (cPGC) when cultured on SI/SI4-m220 cells. Interestingly, IL-11 stimulated mPGC growth comparable to LIF and OSM, but did not affect cPGC survival. IL-6 and CNTF did not affect PGC. In addition, a combination of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 binding subunit (sIL-6R), which is known to activate intracellular signaling via gp130, fully reproduced the LIF action of PGC. Both in the presence and absence of LIF, addition of neutralizing antibody against gp130 in culture remarkably blocked cPGC survival. These results suggest a pivotal role of gp130 in PGC development, especially that it is indispensable for cPGC survival as comparable to the c-KIT-mediated action. We have further demonstrated that a combination of LIF with forskolin or retinoic acid, a potent mitogen for PGC, supported the proliferation of PGC, leading to propagation of the embryonic stem cell-like cells, termed embryonic germ (EG) cells. Since EG cells were also obtained by using OSM or the IL-6/sIL-6R complex in place of LIF, a significant contribution of gp130-mediated signaling in EG cell formation was further suggested.","['Koshimizu, U', 'Taga, T', 'Watanabe, M', 'Saito, M', 'Shirayoshi, Y', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Nakatsuji, N']","['Koshimizu U', 'Taga T', 'Watanabe M', 'Saito M', 'Shirayoshi Y', 'Kishimoto T', 'Nakatsuji N']","['Mammalian Development Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*growth & development', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1996 Apr;122(4):1235-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of children with acute leukemia admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of pneumonia or ARDS from March 1991 to April 1994. SETTING: Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, a 168-bed teaching hospital and regional tertiary referral center for children in northern California. PATIENTS: During this study period, 20% of the 174 admissions of children with acute leukemia had pneumonia at the time of admission or during the course of the hospitalization for a total of 36 admissions. The mean age of these children was 9.2 +/- 1.1 years. RESULTS: Eleven percent of the children with pulmonary infiltrates in one quadrant on the chest x-ray film at the onset of pneumonia and 53% of the children with pulmonary infiltrates in more than one quadrant at the onset of pneumonia died. Fifteen percent of the children without sepsis at the onset of pneumonia and 70% of the children with sepsis at onset died. Eighteen percent of the children without shock at the onset of pneumonia and 75% of the children with shock at the onset died. None of the children died who required < or = 3L/min of O2 to maintain SO2 > or = 95%, but 79% of the children who required > 3L/min O2 died. Using the criteria ""> 3 L/min O2 by nasal cannula to maintain SO2 > or = 95%"" to identify the nonsurvivors had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88%. This specificity was not increased by combining the criteria ""O2 requirements at any time"" and ""the extent of pulmonary infiltrates at the onset of pneumonia."" All children who required mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure had previously received > 3 L/min O2 by nasal cannula to maintain SO2 > or = 95% for 37.8 +/- 12.9 h (range 3 to 96 h). Nine of the 10 children in our study who received mechanical ventilation died. CONCLUSION: In children with acute leukemia and pneumonia, the amount of O2 required to maintain SO2 > or = 95% may identify those who are likely to develop respiratory failure hours before mechanical ventilatory support is needed. The ability to identify children at risk for respiratory failure is not increased by combining the risk factors ""oxygen requirements"" and ""extent of pulmonary infiltrates at the onset of pneumonia"".

Therefore, we examined sera of patients with RA, including those with coexisting Felty's syndrome or leukemia of large granular lymphocytes, for the presence of antibodies to retroviral proteins of human T-lymphotrophic virus type I and type II (HTLV-I/II). Reactivity to recombinant HTLV-I envelope protein rgp21 alone was the primary pattern observed. Twenty-five percent of RA sera, 28% of Felty's syndrome sera, and 30% of large granular lymphocyte leukemia/RA sera reacted with rgp21, each significantly more than the 8% of normal sera (P less than 0.01). Removing rheumatoid factor did not abolish reactivity with rgp21 in any of six RA sera tested. Immunoreactivity to the authentic viral protein was confirmed by using purified rgp21 that was cleaved by CNBr to remove the bacterial fusion peptide, or by blocking sera with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the fusion peptide.

When benz[alpha]anthracene (BA) was included with marrow under cell culture conditions, it was converted to materials which were resolved into three peaks by normal phase HPLC, and which had the chromatographic characteristics of BA-dihydrodiols. Formation of hydroxymethyl-or dihydrodiol-derivatives of 7, 12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene were not detected under the same conditions. The BA-metabolites were identified as BA-5,6-dihydrodiol, BA-10,11-dihydrodiol and BA-8,9-dihydrodiol. The identification was based upon chromatographic properties of the metabolites during normal and reverse phase chromatography and on UV spectral and fluorometric characterization. It was not possible to detect the formation of BA-3,4-dihydrodiol since this dihydrodiol co-elutes with BA-8,9-dihydrodiol and BA-10,11-dihydrodiol during normal phase and reverse phase chromatography, respectively. the UV spectra of BA-3,4-dihydrodiol does not have features which enable it to be readily identified in the presence of these other compounds. Formation of the dihydrodiol-metabolites was dependent on cell number and temperature. Two general cytochrome P450 inhibitors, carbon monoxide and piperonyl butoxide, blocked the formation of metabolites but the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin had no effect. Large variations were observed in the capacity of marrow from different individuals to form benz[alpha]anthracene-dihydrodiols but, in each sample where dihydrodiols were formed, the relative amount of each metabolite was BA-8,9-dihydrodiol >> BA-5,6-dihydrodiol > BA-10,11-dihydrodiol.

In this manuscript, the role of CD45 expression in the development of B-1 malignancies in NZB mice, which serve as a model for human diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was investigated. B-1 cells spontaneously hyperproliferate and form a clonal hyperdiploid malignant population in aging NZB mice. Phenotypic analysis indicates that the NZB malignant B-1 cells are bright for IgM, but have reduced levels of CD45 relative to normal, nonmalignant B cells (both B-1 and B-2) and are characterized by dull or negative expression of the CD45 isoform B220/6B2 normally found on all B cells. Malignant B-1 cells demonstrated decreased RNA levels of CD45 relative to IgM expression, while nonmalignant B-2 cells showed similar levels of RNA expression for both CD45 and IgM. As CD45 exists in several isoforms and B cells express the highest molecular weight isoform (B220), malignant B-1 cells were further analyzed with respect to their isoform usage. Although, at the RNA level malignant B-1 cells showed the presence of the of the B220 form of CD45, western blot analysis of B220 protein suggested a posttranslational glycosylation defect in the CD45/B220 expression recognized by the mAb 6B2. F1 recipients of premalignant NZB B-1 cells which had been sorted for IgMhi, B220/6B2negative cells developed hyperdiploid malignant donor B-1 clones earlier than did recipients of NZB B-1 cells which were bright for B220/6B2. However, all the malignant B-1 clones of NZB origin which developed in recipients of both transfer populations were B220/6B2 negative. This indicated that abnormal expression of CD45 may be prerequisite for long-term growth and malignant transformation. Thus alterations in CD45 may result in abnormal functioning of the malignant B-1 cells which may further affect the proliferation of, or signaling within, these cells.","['Dang, A M', 'Phillips, J A', 'Lin, T', 'Raveche, E S']","['Dang AM', 'Phillips JA', 'Lin T', 'Raveche ES']","['Department of Pathology, UMDNJ/New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Splicing/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(96)90110-0 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0110 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 May 1;169(2):196-207. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0110.,,,,['AI-29740/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

An acid-soluble fraction containing ara-CTP was extracted from blastic cells by ara-C treatment with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 0.3 M) neutralized with an equal volume of cold freon containing 0.5 M tri-n-octylamine. The ara-CTP fraction was separated from the acid -soluble fraction by high-performance liquid chromatography (TSK gel diethylaminoethyl-2 SW column) eluted with 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and 20% acetonitrile. ara-CTP was lyophilized, dephosphorylated to ara-C by incubation with 10 units alkaline phosphatase for 12 h at 55 degrees C, and measured by RIA using anti-ara-C serum. Recovery through the whole procedure was 92%. In the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, the intracellular ara-CTP levels produced when the cells were incubated with ara-c were assayed as above, and they showed a linear increase depending on Ara-C concentrations from 0.01 to 10 microns, demonstrating a very close correlation with the labeled ara CTP levels yielded by cells on incubation with radiolabeled ara-C (r2 = 0.99). The detection limit was 0.1 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, and a sample amount of only 5 x 10(6) cells was enough for each assay. In the clinical applications, our method proved capable of detecting a wide concentration range of ara-CTP produced when patients were treated with ara-C or its derivatives from very low to intermediate doses. No radiolabeled drug was necessary. The method was very useful for in vivo pharmacodynamic studies of ara-C therapy.","['Yamauchi, T', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T']","['Yamauchi T', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*analysis/blood', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer/methods', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/drug therapy', 'Radioimmunoassay/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Apr 15;56(8):1800-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, select patients with malignancies sensitive to available therapies may achieve significant improvement in palliation and long term survival with prompt recognition and appropriate intervention. METHODS: From 1968 to 1994, 150 invasive procedures were performed for the treatment or diagnosis of pericardial effusion in 127 patients with underlying malignancies. These cases were reviewed retrospectively to best identify the clinical features, appropriate diagnostic workup, and optimal therapy for this complication of malignancy. RESULTS: Dyspnea (81%) and an abnormal pulsus paradoxus (32%) were the most common symptoms. Echocardiography had a 96% diagnostic accuracy. Cytology and pericardial biopsy had sensitivities of 90% and 56%, respectively. Fifty-five percent of all effusions were malignant comprising 71% of adenocarcinomas of the lung, breast, esophagus, and unknown primary site. In 57 patients, a malignant effusion could not be determined, and no definitive etiology could be established for 74% of these effusions. Radiation-induced, infectious, and hemorrhagic pericarditis each were identified in fewer than 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Subxyphoid pericardiotomy proved to be a safe and effective intervention that successfully relieved pericardial effusions in 99% of cases with recurrence and reoperation rates of 9% and 7%, respectively. Survival most closely was related to the extent of disease and its inherent chemo-/radiosensitivity, with 72% of the patients who survived longer than 1 year having breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma.","['Wilkes, J D', 'Fidias, P', 'Vaickus, L', 'Perez, R P']","['Wilkes JD', 'Fidias P', 'Vaickus L', 'Perez RP']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pericardial Effusion/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Pericardiectomy/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/10/15 00:00,1995/10/15 00:01,['1995/10/15 00:00'],"['1995/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19951015)76:8<1377::aid-cncr2820760813>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Oct 15;76(8):1377-87. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19951015)76:8<1377::aid-cncr2820760813>3.0.co;2-m.,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its cytotoxic action cannot be circumvented by addition of iron-saturated transferrin or iron-ammonium citrate, indicating that the iron complexing capacity is not responsible for the mechanism of action of this compound. When HL-60, K562 or L1210 leukaemia cells were incubated with the trimidox-iron complex itself, we could observe increases of the 50% growth inhibitory capacity of the complex in comparison with trimidox alone. We conclude that trimidox is able to form an iron complex, but in contrast to other agents, the anticancer activity cannot be contributed to this effect alone. Further studies will have to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of this new and promising anticancer agent.","['Szekeres, T', 'Vielnascher, E', 'Novotny, L', 'Vachalkova, A', 'Fritzer, M', 'Findenig, G', 'Gobl, R', 'Elford, H L', 'Goldenberg, H']","['Szekeres T', 'Vielnascher E', 'Novotny L', 'Vachalkova A', 'Fritzer M', 'Findenig G', 'Gobl R', 'Elford HL', 'Goldenberg H']","['Institut fur Medizinische Chemie, Universitat Wien, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem,European journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry : journal of the Forum of European Clinical Chemistry Societies,9105775,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Benzamidines/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Iron/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polarography', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/cclm.1995.33.11.785 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem. 1995 Nov;33(11):785-9. doi: 10.1515/cclm.1995.33.11.785.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A murine leukemia cell line (L1210/DDP) selected for cisplatin resistance also has been shown to be highly resistant to methotrexate. Of the mechanisms proposed for methotrexate resistance, only changes in methotrexate transport into the cells were found in an earlier report. Methotrexate enters mammalian cells via an active transport system. In the present study, we demonstrated that the transport into the cell may be impaired in the resistant cells due to altered tyrosine phosphorylation of a membrane protein with a molecular mass of 66 kDa. This alteration was manifested by altered tyrosine phosphorylation of the 66 kDa protein and may be an underlying modification that renders the cells resistant to methotrexate. These results suggest involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in folate transport and methotrexate resistant in L1210/DDP cells.","['Bhushan, A', 'Wroblewski, D', 'Xuan, Y', 'Tritton, T R', 'Hacker, M P']","['Bhushan A', 'Wroblewski D', 'Xuan Y', 'Tritton TR', 'Hacker MP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Clone Cells', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/23 00:00,1996/02/23 00:01,['1996/02/23 00:00'],"['1996/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)84208-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)84208-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Feb 23;51(4):477-82. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)84208-0.,,,,"['CA23545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repression of human gamma-globin genes has been demonstrated in MEL cells when transferred as part of the entire beta-globin gene cluster packaged in chromatin. Major differences in these approaches are prior packaging into chromatin and the presence of additional sequences, notably from the locus control region (LCR). In this report we focus on the contribution to gamma-globin gene repression that multiple elements of the LCR may have. We first show preferential activation of beta-globin genes over gamma-globin genes in MEL cells when linked to each other and to LCR sequences containing the core elements of DNase I hypersensitive sites 4, 3, and 2. Removal of the HS4 element had no effect, however, removal of the 225 bp HS3 core element resulted in a five-fold increase in gamma-globin gene expression. The enhancer 3' to the A gamma-globin gene also had no apparent effect on gamma-globin gene expression. These results provide first evidence of gamma-globin gene repression involving the core region of HS3 in the presence of the core region of HS2 and a beta-globin gene. A mechanism for repression involving sequestration of the gamma-promoter away from the strong enhancer activity of HS2 is proposed.","['Stoeckert, C J Jr', 'Cheng, H']","['Stoeckert CJ Jr', 'Cheng H']","[""Joseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199603)51:3<220::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199603)51:3<220::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Mar;51(3):220-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199603)51:3<220::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,,['HL-45123/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations have suggested that elimination of tumor by BCNU is dependent on more than the cytotoxic activity of the drug. We have extended those findings by showing that cyclosporin A (CS) can inhibit the BCNU-mediated rejection of EL-4 or L1210 tumors in mice. It was shown that mice could be cured of EL-4 or L1210 ascites tumors with a single intraperitoneal injection of BCNU. When CS, an inhibitor of the activation of T lymphocytes, was administered to mice that had received either EL-4 or L1210 tumor and were treated with BCNU, nearly all the mice died by Day 60. When CS was administered to BCNU-treated mice starting at 1, 2 or 3 weeks after tumor injection, inhibition of the BCNU therapy did not occur. Finally, the ability of animals that had been cured of tumor by the BCNU therapy to reject a lethal challenge dose of homologous tumor was shown to be CS insensitive. These results suggest that the BCNU-mediated elimination of tumor from mice requires a functional immune response in addition to the cytotoxic activity of this chemotherapeutic agent.","['Steele, T A', 'Cox, D C']","['Steele TA', 'Cox DC']","['Department of Microbiology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

To determine whether the phenotypic differentiation of immortalized cells is linked to the regulation of telomerase activity, terminal differentiation was induced in leukemic cell lines by diverse agents. A pronounced downregulation of telomerase activity was produced as a consequence of the differentiated status. The differentiation-inducing agents did not directly inhibit telomerase activity, suggesting that the inhibition of telomerase activity is in response to induction of differentiation. The loss of telomerase activity was not due to the production of an inhibitor, since extracts from differentiated cells did not cause inhibition of telomerase activity. By using additional cell lineages including epithelial and embryonal stem cells, down-regulation of telomerase activity was found to be a general response to the induction of differentiation.

We have investigated this issue by ectopically expressing human (hu) CD34 on the surface of murine hemopoietic cells. Forced expression of hu-CD34 in the thymocytes of transgenic mice did not appear to affect the development, maturation, or distribution of murine T cells but did significantly increase their ability to adhere to bone marrow stromal layers of human but not mouse origin. Ectopic expression of hu-CD34 on murine 416B cells, a multipotential progenitor that expresses murine CD34, yielded similar results. In both cases hu-CD34-dependent adhesion was enhanced by molecular engagement of the hu-CD34 protein using anti-CD34 antibodies. These results provide evidence that CD34 promotes the adhesive interactions of hemopoietic cells with the stromal microenvironment of the bone marrow thereby implicating CD34 in regulation and compartmentalization of stem cells. We propose that CD34 regulates these processes in part via an indirect mechanism, signaling changes in cellular adhesion in response to molecular recognition of an as yet unidentified stromal CD34 counterreceptor or ligand.","['Healy, L', 'May, G', 'Gale, K', 'Grosveld, F', 'Greaves, M', 'Enver, T']","['Healy L', 'May G', 'Gale K', 'Grosveld F', 'Greaves M', 'Enver T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1995/12/19 00:00,1995/12/19 00:01,['1995/12/19 00:00'],"['1995/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.26.12240 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Dec 19;92(26):12240-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.26.12240.,,,,,PMC40332,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fused genes encode chimeric proteins proteins. Because the Drosophila homologue of ALL1, trithorax, is a positive regulator of homeotic genes and acts at the level of transcription, it is conceivable that alterations in ALL1 transcriptional activity may underlie its action in malignant transformation. To begin studying this, we examined the All1, AF4, AF9, and AF17 proteins for the presence of potential transcriptional regulatory domains. This was done by fusing regions of the proteins to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain and assaying their effect on transcription of a reporter gene. A domain of 55 residues positioned at amino acids 2829-2883 of ALL1 was identified as a very strong activator. Further analysis of this domain by in vitro mutagenesis pointed to a core of hydrophobic and acidic residues as critical for the activity. An ALL1 domain that repressed transcription of the reporter gene coincided with the sequence homologous to a segment of DNA methyltransferase. An AF4 polypeptide containing residues 480-560 showed strong activation potential. The C-terminal segment of AF9 spanning amino acids 478-568 transactivated transcription of the reporter gene in HeLa but not in NIH 3T3 cells.

To overcome this problem, a selectable retroviral vector system for gene therapy has been developed for gene therapy of Gaucher disease. We constructed a bicistronic retroviral vector containing the human glucocerebrosidase (GC) cDNA and the human small cell surface antigen CD24 (243 bp). Expression of both cDNAs was controlled by the long terminal repeat enhancer/promoter of the Molony murine leukemia virus. The CD24 selectable marker was placed downstream of the GC cDNA and its translation was enhanced by inclusion of the long 5' untranslated region of encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site. Virus-producing GP+envAM12 cells were created by multiple supernatant transductions to create vector producer cells. The vector LGEC has a high titer and can drive expression of GC and the cell surface antigen CD24 simultaneously in transduced NIH 3T3 cells and Gaucher skin fibroblasts. These transduced cells have been successfully separated from untransduced cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, based on cell surface expression of CD24. Transduced and sorted NIH 3T3 cells showed higher GC enzyme activity than the unsorted population, demonstrating coordinated expression of both genes. Fibroblasts from Gaucher patients were transduced and sorted for CD24 expression, and GC enzyme activity was measured. The transduced sorted Gaucher fibroblasts had a marked increase in enzyme activity (149%) compared with virgin Gaucher fibroblasts (17% of normal GC enzyme activity). Efficient transduction of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (20-40%) was accomplished and fluorescence-activated cell sorted CD24(+)-expressing progenitors generated colonies, all of which (100%) were vector positive. The sorted, CD24-expressing progenitors generated erythroid burst-forming units, colony-forming units (CFU)-granulocyte, CFU-macrophage, CFU-granulocyte/macrophage, and CFU-mix hematopoietic colonies, demonstrating their ability to differentiate into these myeloid lineages in vitro. The transduced, sorted progenitors raised the GC enzyme levels in their progeny cells manyfold compared with untransduced CD34+ progenitors. Collectively, this demonstrates the development of high titer, selectable bicistronic vectors that allow isolation of transduced hematopoietic progenitors and cells that have been metabolically corrected.","['Migita, M', 'Medin, J A', 'Pawliuk, R', 'Jacobson, S', 'Nagle, J W', 'Anderson, S', 'Amiri, M', 'Humphries, R K', 'Karlsson, S']","['Migita M', 'Medin JA', 'Pawliuk R', 'Jacobson S', 'Nagle JW', 'Anderson S', 'Amiri M', 'Humphries RK', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular and Medical Genetics Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Cd24a protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gaucher Disease/*genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glucosylceramidase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1995/12/19 00:00,1995/12/19 00:01,['1995/12/19 00:00'],"['1995/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.26.12075 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Dec 19;92(26):12075-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.26.12075.,,,,,PMC40299,,,,,,,,,,,,

When expressed in yeast, AAT1 mediates high-affinity transport of basic amino acids, but to a lower extent also recognizes acidic and neutral amino acids. AAT1-mediated histidine transport is sensitive to protonophores and occurs against a concentration gradient, indicating that AAT1 may function as a proton symporter.

Pediatric Oncology Group.,1428-34,"BACKGROUND: The value of autologous bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unknown. We compared autologous bone marrow transplantation with intensive consolidation chemotherapy as treatments for children with AML in first remission. METHODS: We induced remission with one course of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine, followed by one course of high-dose cytarabine (3 g per square meter of body-surface area for six doses). Patients in remission after the second course of induction therapy were eligible for randomization. Between June 1988 and March 1993, 552 of 649 enrolled patients who could be evaluated (85 percent) entered remission. A total of 209 patients were not eligible for randomization; of the remaining 343 patients, 232 were randomly assigned to receive six courses of intensive chemotherapy (117 patients) or autologous transplantation (115 patients). Of the original 649 patients, 189, including 21 with Down's syndrome, were nonrandomly assigned to receive intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: The rates of event-free survival and overall survival for the entire group at three years were 34 +/- 2.5 percent and 42 +/- 2.6 percent, respectively. For patients who were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, the mean (+/- SE) rates of event-free survival three years after randomization were not significantly different in the two groups when examined by intention-to-treat analysis: 36 +/- 5.8 percent for the intensive-chemotherapy group as compared with 38 +/- 6.4 percent for the autologous-transplantation group; and the relative risk of treatment failure for the chemotherapy group as compared with the autologous-transplantation group was 0.81 (P = 0.20 by the log rank test; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.58 to 1.12). Overall survival at three years followed a similar pattern. There was a lower relapse rate (31 percent vs. 58 percent, P < 0.001) but a higher rate of treatment-related mortality (15 percent vs. 2.7 percent, P = 0.005) in the group treated with autologous transplantation than in the intensive-chemotherapy group. The event-free survival at three years for the nonrandomized intensive-chemotherapy group was 39 +/- 5.1 percent, and for a contemporaneous group of patients each of whom received a histocompatible bone marrow transplant from a sibling, it was 52 +/- 8.0 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of children with AML in first remission with either autologous bone marrow transplantation or intensive chemotherapy prolongs event-free survival equally.","['Ravindranath, Y', 'Yeager, A M', 'Chang, M N', 'Steuber, C P', 'Krischer, J', 'Graham-Pole, J', 'Carroll, A', 'Inoue, S', 'Camitta, B', 'Weinstein, H J']","['Ravindranath Y', 'Yeager AM', 'Chang MN', 'Steuber CP', 'Krischer J', 'Graham-Pole J', 'Carroll A', 'Inoue S', 'Camitta B', 'Weinstein HJ']","[""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/05/30 00:00,1996/05/30 00:01,['1996/05/30 00:00'],"['1996/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199605303342203 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1996 May 30;334(22):1428-34. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199605303342203.,,,,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose ara-C (HIDAC) may overcome ara-C resistance in leukemic blasts, and it has been used as a successful salvage regimen and in postremission therapy. The data from ALSG suggest that a dose-effect relationship exists for ara-C in AML, that the use of HIDAC prolongs remission duration and disease-free survival and that it is tolerable when used as initial induction therapy in patients with de novo AML.

Although interleukin-3 (IL-3) can initiate megakaryocytic progenitor cell development, it cannot complete this process. TPO is absolutely essential for full theory to clinical trials, and many of the properties predicted by early investigators using semipurified preparations of plasma-derived material have been verified using recombinant protein. TPO increases the size, ploidy, and cell-surface expression of platelet-specific proteins. TPO also stimulates the proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells and augments the erythroid progenitor response to erythropoietin and other early-acting cytokines. TPO levels are inversely related to platelet mass; the recombinant protein stimulates thrombopoiesis and, to a lesser extent, erythropoiesis.

Advances in new drug activity have contributed greatly to that and are responsible for curing about 20 percent of patients diagnosed today. Progress in supportive care has been equally important; broad-spectrum antibiotics are now allowing patients to survive long enough to receive an adequate course of chemotherapy, to which most patients respond with a complete remission. More recently, the development of colony-stimulating factors and their safe use during induction therapy in high-risk patients has allowed greater numbers of patients to be adequately treated during the initial phase of therapy. The most significant recent advance in treatment for acute leukemia is the demonstration that certain leukemic syndromes respond dramatically to specific interventions that are substantially less active in other leukemic syndromes. The challenge for the near future is to understand the mechanisms behind these empiric observations and, for the long-term, to learn to use such information to design molecularly targeted therapy for specific leukemic syndromes that are characterized by unique molecular features.

Data also indicate linkage between Pgp and many adverse prognostic features, including cytogenetic pattern, surface phenotype, and evolution from an antecedent hematologic disorder. Pharmacologic inhibitors of Pgp function have been targeted for investigation in elderly AML patients. Non-Pgp mechanisms responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes that are only weakly sensitive to classic Pgp modulators, however, may limit the success of such strategies. Overexpression of the lung-resistance protein (LRP) in AML has also been linked to advanced age, secondary leukemia, and Pgp overexpression. In a study of 66 patients at the Arizona Cancer Center, LRP overexpression was a more important predictor of response to induction therapy for AML than was Pgp. Recent investigations indicate that overexpression of the gene encoding the MDR-related protein (MRP), though rare in de novo AML, may be common in high-risk groups such as relapsed patients and secondary AML.

The latter is especially true in older persons receiving intensive but not marrow-ablative chemotherapy. Studies of stem cell aging using murine models yield conflicting data. Unfortunately, few studies address the effect of aging on human hematopoietic stem cells, largely because there is no true pluripotent stem cell assay. Some work indicates that the proliferative capacity of human hematopoietic stem cells appears to decrease with age but is unclear whether this is of clinical significance. Our preliminary analysis of more than 500 autotransplant candidates by univariate analysis indicates that higher patient age correlates with reduced committed hematopoietic progenitor cell levels but not with delayed engraftment. In the future, the use of combinations of assays that include phenotypic (CD34+thy1+CD38lo) and functional (long-term culture-initiating cell) characteristics may better identify the effects of aging on candidate stem cells. The development of assays that predict delayed hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy in older adults may help to tailor therapy for specific patients with the hope of reducing morbidity while retaining efficacy.","['Keating, A']",['Keating A'],"['Leukemia and Transplant Service, Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/analysis', 'Thy-1 Antigens/analysis']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10 Suppl 1:S30-2.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significantly higher relapse-free survival was predicted by M3 morphology, a favorable karyotype, including t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16), and the absence of dysmyelopoiesis. In contrast, dysmyelopoiesis, high serum lactic dehydrogenase, age over 64, and unfavorable karyotype, including abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7 and complex abnormalities, all predicted a low relapse-free survival rate. No comparable impact on relapse-free survival was found from the two randomized different intensities of induction treatment in each age-group. Age, LDH, M3, and karyotype contributed to a prognostic index that identified good, intermediate, and poor prognostic groups. Patients older than age 60 showed significantly less frequent favorable and more frequent unfavorable karyotypes, and received generally less-intensive induction treatment than what younger patients were given.

The poor outcome of treatment for elderly AML patients is due both to host-related and intrinsic biologic factors. Some elderly patients have documented MDS for months or years before presenting with AML. Many more, though, have dysplastic morphology in bone marrow and blood cells that suggests an occult preleukemic phase. Cytotoxic chemotherapy in elderly patients has a high morbidity and mortality due to comorbid diseases, diminished tolerance to prolonged pancytopenia, and decreased drug metabolism and excretion; doses, therefore, are often attenuated. The low response rates to conventional remission-induction chemotherapy regimens suggest both intrinsic drug resistance and diminished normal hematopoietic precursors to regenerate following therapy. Less intensive chemotherapy has the potential for less organ toxicity, less hospitalization, and less expense. However, attenuated chemotherapy has the major disadvantage of less antileukemic activity and, as yet, the survival benefit for this approach remains unproven. Nevertheless, low-dose ara-C (cytarabine) therapy for 2 to 3 weeks may be beneficial for some patients.

Studies of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy supported by bone marrow or blood stem-cell transplantation suggest that immune-mediated effects of transplanted cells help control disease. This antileukemic (graft-versus-leukemia) effect represents several immune reactions. Various approaches to introduce or enhance such immune reactivity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are being explored. There is some indication, even in older patients, that immunotherapy is better tolerated than chemotherapy, and efforts are underway to find the most effective treatment for maintaining remission after induction chemotherapy. We have developed a strategy that combines myeloablative chemotherapy with transplantation of autologous stem cells that have been cultured for 1 week in interleukin-2. Low-dose interleukin-2 is also administered for the first week after stem cell infusion. Although all patients developed side effects of fever and fatigue, even older patients tolerated this regimen well. The 3-year disease-free survival rate in a high-risk patient group transplanted in early first remission is 41 percent. Several other compounds are being investigated for their ability to enhance immune reactions after induction chemotherapy for AML. Although immunotherapy cannot eliminate overt leukemia and cytoreductive treatment is still needed initially, immunotherapy may find a place in postinduction management of AML to eliminate minimal (residual) disease or control its growth.","['Klingemann, H G']",['Klingemann HG'],"['University of British Columbia, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10 Suppl 1:S21-2.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consolidation usually consists of a repeat cycle of conventional-dose induction chemotherapy. Older patients who achieve complete remission may represent a select population, clinically distinct from patients receiving induction therapy. Regardless of the consolidation regimen, the duration of complete remission is 3 months to 11 months, with long-term leukemia-free survival rates of 10 percent to 28 percent.

We describe here two cases of another hyperinflammatory reaction during all-trans retinoic acid therapy, the Sweet's syndrome, consisting of infiltrates of the skin and internal organs by neutrophilic granulocytes. Fever, painful erythematous cutaneous plaques, prominent musculoskeletal involvement (myositis, fasciitis), a sterile pulmonary infiltration and intercurrent proteinuria characterized the clinical course of all-trans retinoic acid-associated Sweet's syndrome. Treatment with glucocorticoids led to resolution of the syndrome within 48 h. Three other cases of all-trans retinoic acid-associated Sweet's syndrome without involvement of internal organs, prominent on our cases, were published previously. Recognition of ATRA-associated Sweet's syndrome is of practical importance.","['Christ, E', 'Linka, A', 'Jacky, E', 'Speich, R', 'Marincek, B', 'Schaffner, A']","['Christ E', 'Linka A', 'Jacky E', 'Speich R', 'Marincek B', 'Schaffner A']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, University Medical School of Zurich, Switerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Sweet Syndrome/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):731-4.,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H and RD) cells comprise only a minority of the cellular infiltrate in HD-lymph nodes, molecular studies concerning the status of oncogenes have been difficult to perform and have yielded conflicting results. We have established a single cell PCR assay for N-ras analysis and have examined H and RS cells from 12 cases of HD by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. None of the single H and RS cells examined carried N-ras mutations at either codons 12/13 or 61.

Percentage of benzidine-positive cells synthesizing hemoglobin and level of glycophorin A expression in the cells were increased after EPO treatment.

These perspectives are somewhat hampered by the large variation in bioavailability between individual patients and the obvious requirement to monitor plasma concentration and area-under the curve values (AUC) for an appropriate adjustment of idarubicin dose. In this study we describe the pharmacokinetics of idarubicin and its main metabolite idarubicin in 12 patients after oral application of 20 mg/m2 idarubicin on 3 consecutive days and demonstrate that the 24-h trough levels shows high correlation with AUC and may thus allow a rapid and easy determination of individual drug concentrations and an appropriate dose adjustment. The average terminal half-life was 30.5h for idarubicin and 66.9 h for idarubicinol. The AUC for idarubicin and its main metabolite idarubicinol revealed a substantial interpatient variation with AUC values ranging from 25.7 to 114 ng x h/ml (average 58.1 ng x h/ml) for idarubicin and from 109.4 - 445.2 ng x h/ml (average 287.3 ng x h/ml) for idarubicinol. However, the ratio of idarubicin/idarubicinol differed only two-fold from 1:3.7 to 1:7.7 with an average of 1:5.1. Both idarubicin and idarubicinol concentrations were highly reproducible, however, upon measurements after repeated applications within individual patients. Moreover, idarubicinol and idarubicin AUCs showed a good correlation with r=0.78, indicating that the interindividual variations of idarubicin AUC reflects differences in absorptions rather than metabolism. In order to describe the interindividual bioavailability of idarubicin - represented by AUC - measurement of a single data point with a high correlation with the AUC would be ideal. Our study demonstrates that the 24-h trough level shows such an excellent correlation (r=0.96) with AUC, making it the perfect candidate for fast estimates of the individual bioavailability in a given patient. On this basis, the longitudinal measurement of the 24-h trough level may allow the assessment of the impact of interindividual variations in AUC of clinical outcome and toxicity.","['Schleyer, E', 'Kuhn, S', 'Ruhrs, H', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Kaufmann, C C', 'Kern, W', 'Braess, J', 'Straubel, G', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Schleyer E', 'Kuhn S', 'Ruhrs H', 'Unterhalt M', 'Kaufmann CC', 'Kern W', 'Braess J', 'Straubel G', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):707-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blotting confirmed the results of the immunofluorescence test at the protein level. In BALM-9N, L chains were absent even in the cytoplasm as demonstrated by Western blotting. Evidence that the subclones have the same ancestry was provided both by cytogenetic analysis and by Southern blotting, which revealed the 14q32 chromosomal rearrangement as a common abnormality and the same IgH gene arrangement among the subclones.

The four clinically poor PRD responders with B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL were also PNA negative. Within T cell ALL, PNA-positive patients had a 3.4-fold (95% Cl, 1.1-10.4, P = 0.03) lower relative risk of any event, than PNA-negative patients. Within BCP-ALL, PNA binding was not of prognostic significance. In conclusion, PNA positivity, especially frequent in T cell ALL, is a marker for a subgroup of childhood ALL patients who are very likely to respond well to systemic PRD 'monotherapy'. In addition, PNA positivity is a favorable prognostic factor in T cell ALL.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Veerman, A J', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Van Der Linden-Schrever, B E', 'Van Zantwijk, C H', 'Van Der Does-Van Den Berg, A', 'Pieters, R']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'Van Wering ER', 'Van Der Linden-Schrever BE', 'Van Zantwijk CH', 'Van Der Does-Van Den Berg A', 'Pieters R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arachis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Peanut Agglutinin', 'Plant Lectins', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):675-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proband was diagnosed with AML at age 47; within 6 months, her sister, age 41, was diagnosed with MDS. The proband's father, grandfather and a paternal uncle all died of AML, preceded by a pre-leukemic phase. The five cases had several clinical features in common. In the two sisters and their paternal uncle, cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow cells revealed a common abnormality characterized by loss of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q). No constitutional cytogenetic abnormality was detected in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from the proband. In addition, there was no history of common environmental or occupational exposure in the family. The occurrence of AML and MDS in three generations of this family most likely resulted from a single gene defect with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The association with the somatic loss of 5q material in the leukemia cells of affected members suggests that a germline mutation of a leukemia suppressor gene located on 5q might be the primary event responsible for hereditary susceptibility to leukemia in this family.","['Olopade, O I', 'Roulston, D', 'Baker, T', 'Narvid, S', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Larson, R A', 'Golomb, H M']","['Olopade OI', 'Roulston D', 'Baker T', 'Narvid S', 'Le Beau MM', 'Freireich EJ', 'Larson RA', 'Golomb HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Family', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Pedigree']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):669-74.,,,,"['CA 14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA 40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven cases were investigated at diagnosis of MDS, and four at transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (MDS-AML). Using conventional cytogenetics, monosomy 7 was detected in nine cases, monosomy 17 in two, and trisomy 8 in five, either as a single aberration or as part of a complex clone. One case had both monosomy 7 and 17. Three biotinylated DNA probes directed against the pericentromeric region of chromosomes 7, 8 and 17, respectively, were used. Bone marrow smears were first stained with May-Grunewald-Giemsa (MGG) for morphologic evaluation, and regions of interest documented by photography. Later the same regions were targeted after hybridization, which allowed FISH analysis of selected bone marrow cells. In each patient between 267 and 921 cells (mean 453) were studied. In most cases a majority of the non-lymphoid bone marrow cells appeared to be of clonal origin, ie showed either monosomy or trisomy by FISH, while in contrast both lymphocytes and plasma cells generally were disomic, ie displayed two fluorescent spots for each probe. The percentages of clonal bone marrow cells differed greatly between patients, but in a single case there was a good agreement between the extent of granulocytic, monocytic and erythrocytic cell lineage involvement. In relation to the clinical stage of MDS, patients with more advanced disease had a significantly higher mean percentage of bone marrow blasts showing monosomy or trisomy, while disomic, possibly non-clonal cells were more frequent among the earlier forms of MDS. In the four cases of MDS-AML nearly all non-lymphoid bone marrow cells belonged to the abnormal clone. The FISH technique offers information regarding the distribution of clonal and non-clonal bone marrow cells in MDS, which might have prognostic and possibly, therapeutic implications.","['Bernell, P', 'Jacobsson, B', 'Nordgren, A', 'Hast, R']","['Bernell P', 'Jacobsson B', 'Nordgren A', 'Hast R']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institue, Danderyd Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', '*Trisomy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):662-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using gene analysis, rearrangement was demonstrated in one patient for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene, five for TcR-beta gene, and four for TcR-gamma gene. Fifteen patients (94%) had rearranged band(s) involving the joining region of the TcR-delta chain gene. In nine cases these were the only rearrangements, whereas in six cases TcR-beta and/or TcR-gamma gene rearrangements were found as well. The D delta 2(D delta)J delta 1 rearrangement was demonstrated in 87.5% (14/16) of cases.

Our data suggest that DDJ delta joining occurs at an early stage during T cell differentiation, followed by rearrangements of V delta to the DDJ delta complex. Furthermore, our findings suggest that DDJ delta recombination occurs earlier than expression of CyCD3 epsilon protein products. DDJ delta rearrangements have never been observed in non-T cell malignancies, such as precursor-B-ALL or acute myeloid leukemia.

The cytogenetic breakpoints of 7q deletions are variable, with both terminal and interstitial deletions reported. It is now believed that most deletions are interstitial, and that the variability in reported breakpoints may be due to the difficulty in determining whether the terminal, pale staining G band is present. It has also been suggested that some reported deletions of 7q may be cryptic translocations. To address these questions, we carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on leukaemic cells from a large series of patients using a chromosome 7-specific paint and a 7q telomere-specific probe. Of the 26 cases studied, seven were 'pure' deletions (ie without the involvement of other chromosomes); four were interstitial and two terminal. One further patient had two clones each with a different deletion: one with a terminal del(7)(q22) and the second with an interstitial del(7)(q32-qter). A further nine cases had unbalanced translocations with deletion of 7q terminal sequences.

A 6-kb HindIII-fragment harboring the entire TRAP gene was subcloned and the 5'-flanking region of 3026 bp was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence data showed the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites. Two transcriptional start sites were identified in the untranslated exon 1 at positions -349 and -347 bp relative to the translational start codon. Linked to a luciferase-encoding reporter gene the 5'-flanking region was sufficient to direct transcription in the heterologous cell line BHK-21. Treatment of the transfected cells with different modulators of the intracellular iron content showed that regulation of TRAP expression is dependent on iron.

We have studied the p16 gene in 76 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 18 hematologically normal controls by quantitative Southern blotting. No deletions or rearrangements were detected. Twenty-five cases also showed no abnormal band patterns by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis of the coding sequence. We analyzed 60 AML samples for p16 protein expression by Western blot analysis. A reduced level of p16 was observed in six cases, however, none of them showed methylation of the 5'-CpG island. Over-expression of p16 protein was detected in six cases. Studies in cell lines have suggested a feedback loop between p16 and pRb with a futile overproduction of p16 protein in cells containing abnormal pRb. In accordance with these findings, four of the AML cases with high levels of p16 had abnormal pRb (two alteration in band size, two absent).

CDKN2 encodes a 16 kDa protein product (p16INK4A), which functions as a specific inhibitor or the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. There have been many reports indicating a higher frequency of deletions of the CDKN2 gene in a variety of tumor cell lines, in comparison to primary tumors. These studies raise the possibility that deletions of CDKN2 may be a rare event in primary tumors, and in fact arise in vitro, during the establishment of permanent cell lines. To address this issue, we determined whether the CDKN2 gene deletions found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines are also detected in the primary leukemia samples. Eleven cell lines were identified which had available frozen primary samples of their original leukemic tissue. Five out of 11 of these cell lines, as well as their primary samples had homozygous CDKN2 deletions. The remaining six cell lines and their primary samples retained at least one copy of the CDKN2 gene. Of the six CDKN2+ cell lines, five expressed CDKN2 mRNA, but only one of these expressed the p16 protein product (as did its primary sample). Our results indicate that CDKN2 deletions present in the studied ALL cell lines arose in the primary leukemic cells, and not during cell line establishment or prolonged in vitro culture.","['Jagasia, A A', 'Sher, D A', 'Le Moine, P J', 'Kim, D H', 'Moldwin, R L', 'Smith, S D', 'Diaz, M O']","['Jagasia AA', 'Sher DA', 'Le Moine PJ', 'Kim DH', 'Moldwin RL', 'Smith SD', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):624-8.,,,,"['CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate its clinical significance we examined the clinical and hematological data in nine ANLL patients in whom we found this change, in a series of 175 cytogenetically abnormal ANLL patients. Morphologically, six of the patients were FAB-M1, two were FAB-M4 and one was FAB-M5. Bone marrow aspirates contained more than 90% blasts in eight of the patients. By immunophenotype, TdT was present in four of the patients, CD34 was present in four of five patients tested and CD5 was present in one of five patients tested. Blast cells in all patients expressed two or more myeloid surface antigens. These data suggest the proliferation of an immature myeloid cell in these patients. Complete remission was achieved in seven patients; however, remissions were short-lived. Eight patients expired between 1 and 13 months from diagnosis (median survival 5 months). Combining our findings with data in the published literature on trisomy 13 in ANLL, a larger data set consisting of 29 patients was established to determine better the clinical significance of this cytogenetic entity in ANLL. We found that this cytogenetic change has been reported in all subsets of FAB classification excepting M6 and M7. Median age at presentation was 60 years and no association with gender was noted. Median WBC was 29.5 x 10(9)/l, the majority of patients were thrombocytopenic (median platelet count 86 x 10(9)/l) and median survival was 5.2 months. This study associates trisomy 13 with malignant transformation of myeloid progenitor cells.

The causes of death of 118 evaluable patients were compared to a series of 123 AML initial remission induction failures previously reported from our institution. The induction failure rate was significantly lower (30 vs 43% P <0.001). We found a significant decrease in fatal infections (autopsied patients, P = 0.001) and a reduction in bacterial (autopsied and non-autopsied patients, P <0.005) but not fungal (non-autopsied patients, P = 0.93; autopsied patients P = 0.15) infections as causes of induction death. Pulmonary hemorrhage was twice as common in the present report (P < 0.005, with pulmonary hemorrhage almost three times as common as fatal cerebral hemorrhage.

The FLT3R belongs to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in hematopoiesis that also includes KIT, the receptor for SCF (stem cell factor), and FMS. the receptor for M-CSF (macrophage colony- stimulating factor). Restricted FLT3R expression was seen on human and murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. In functional assays recombinant FL stimulated the proliferation and colony formation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells, i.e. CD34+ cord and peripheral blood, bone marrow and fetal liver cells. Synergy was reported for co-stimulation with G-CSF (granulocyte-CSF). GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage CSF), M-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), PIXY-321 (an IL-3/GM-CSF fusion protein) and SCF. In the mouse, FL potently enhanced growth of various types of progenitor/precursor cells in synergy with G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-11, IL-12 and SCF. The well-documented involvement of this ligand-receptor pair in physiological hematopoiesis brought forth the question whether FLT3R and FL might also have a role in the pathobiology of leukemia. At the mRNA level FLT3R was expressed by most (80-100%) cases of AML (acute myeloid leukemia) throughout the different morphological subtypes (MO-M7), of ALL(acute lymphoblastic leukemia) of the immunological subtypes T-ALL and BCP-ALL (B cell precursor ALL including pre-pre B-ALL, cALL and pre B-ALL), of AMLL (acute mixed-lineage leukemia), and of CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) in lymphoid or mixed blast crisis. Analysis of cell surface expression of FLT3R by flow cytometry confirmed these observations for AML (66% positivity when the data from all studies are combined), BCP-ALL (64%) and CML lymphoid blast crisis (86%) whereas less than 30% of T-ALL were FLT3R+. The myeloid, monocytic and pre B cell type categories also contained the highest proportions of FLT3R+ leukemia cell lines . In contrast to the selective expression of the receptor, FL expression was detected in 90-100% of the various cell types of leukemia cell lines from all hematopoietic cell lineages. The potential of FL to induce proliferation of leukemia cells in vitro was also examined in primary and continuously cultured leukemia cells. The data on FL-stimulated leukemia cell growth underline the extensive heterogeneity of primary AML and ALL samples in terms of cytokine-inducible DNA synthesis that has been seen with other effective cytokines. While the majority of T-ALL (0-33% of the cases responded proliferatively; mean 11%) and BCP-ALL (0-30%; mean 20%) failed to proliferate in the presence of FL despite strong expression of surface FLT3R, FL caused a proliferative response in a significantly higher percentage of AML cases (22-90%; mean 53%). In the panel of leukemia cell lines examined only myeloid and monocytic growth factor- dependent cell lines increased their proliferation upon incubation with FL, whereas all growth factor-independent cell lines were refractory to stimulation. Combinations of FL with G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, PIXY- 321 or SCF and FL with IL-3 or IL-7 had synergistic or additive mitogenic effects on primary AML and ALL cells, respectively. The potent stimulation of the myelomonocytic cell lines was further augmented by addition of bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), GM-CSF, IL-3 or SCF. The inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1 (transforming growth factor-beta 1) on FL- supported proliferation were abrogated by bFGF. Taken together, these results demonstrate the expression of functional FLT3R capable of mediating FL- dependent mitogenic signaling in a subset of AML and ALL cases further underline the heterogeneity of AML and ALL samples in their proliferative response to cytokine.","['Drexler, H G']",['Drexler HG'],"['DSMZ -German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Apr;10(4):588-99.,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisense [S]ODNs targeted to specific oncogenes have been used with some therapeutic success in animal models human leukemia; however, the potential for antisense [S]ODN treatment of solid tumors has only recently been explored. PURPOSE: We evaluated the effects of antisense [S]ODNs targeted to the c-myc oncogene on the proliferation of human melanoma cells in vitro and on the growth of human melanoma xenografts in CD-1 nude (nu/nu) mice, METHODS: The effects of 15-mer [S]ODNs containing c-myc sense, c-myc antisense, and two different scrambled sequences on the proliferation and viability of cultures of three established human melanoma cell lines (M14, JR8, and PLF2) were determined by measuring cell numbers and use of the trypan blue exclusion test. The induction of apoptosis in these cells following treatment with [S]ODNs was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. FACS analysis was also used to determine the effects of [S]ODN treatment on the proliferation of primary cultures of a human melanoma explant (NG cells). The expression of c-Myc protein in cultured NG cells after treatment with [S]ODNs was examined by western blot analysis. The antitumor activity and the toxic effects of several [S]ODN treatment regimens were monitored by measuring differences in tumor weight (percent tumor weight inhibition), tumor growth rate (tumor growth inhibition), animal lifespan (percent increase in lifespan), the number of toxic deaths and the median number of long metastases in treated and control mice bearing NG xenografts. c-Myc protein expression in NG tumor cells following [S]ODN treatment was evaluated by FACS analysis, and the extent of apoptosis in these cells was determined by FACS analysis and morphologic examination. RESULTS: Treatment with antisense [S]ODNs, but not the others, inhibited the growth of all tested melanoma cultures in vitro; FACS analysis revealed that growth inhibition was associated with the induction of apoptosis. Antisense [S]ODN treatment also led to reduced celluLar levels of c-Myc protein. In vivo, [S]ODN antitumor activity and toxicity were dose and schedule dependent; however, only antisense [S]ODNs exhibited antitumor activity.

Secondary, or therapy-related, AML accounts for 10%-20% of all AML cases. This review addresses four overarching areas of investigation focused on secondary AMLs: 1) dissection of the molecular structure of the induced genetic lesions and identification of the functional consequences of these changes, thereby providing clues to the pathogenesis of secondary AML and potentially serving as a basis for innovative therapeutic interventions; 2) identification and characterization of mechanisms of DNA damage and the orderly repair of such damage; 3) identification and application of accurate biomarkers of leukemogenesis for the purpose of risk prediction and quantification, potentially allowing recognition of patients especially susceptible to the leukemogenic effects of chemotherapy (for genetic or acquired reasons) and allowing their treatment for cancer to be modified on the basis of this susceptibility; and 4) design and implementation of longitudinal clinical and genetic monitoring of high-risk populations (i.e., individuals under-going cytotoxic therapies for primary cancers). This review of the literature relating to these areas builds upon these themes and attempts to synthesize these seemingly disparate areas of research so that they can be more effectively utilized together to address the problem of secondary AML. Ultimately, the evaluation of these areas will improve our understanding of de novo leukemia and will serve as a springboard for the development of new concepts of therapy and prevention.","['Smith, M A', 'McCaffrey, R P', 'Karp, J E']","['Smith MA', 'McCaffrey RP', 'Karp JE']","['National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",1996/04/03 00:00,1996/04/03 00:01,['1996/04/03 00:00'],"['1996/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.7.407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Apr 3;88(7):407-18. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.7.407.,,,199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Models of autostimulatory leukemia were generated by transfecting a mouse IL-2-dependent cell line (FD.C/2) with vectors directing production of IL-2 by these cells. One series of clones grew in a density-dependent manner in the absence of exogenous IL-2 and produced tumors in syngeneic mice. Although these clones released relatively small amounts of IL-2, their growth and survival was only partially inhibited by Abs to IL-2 or the IL-2R. Another autostimulatory clone was derived, using a different vector, which produced significantly less IL-2. Treatment of cells of this clone with Abs to IL-2 or its receptor resulted in death of all cells. These data demonstrate that Abs that antagonize growth factor action can induce the death of cells transformed by autostimulatory mechanisms. They suggest that while autostimulatory tumors are relatively resistant to Abs that block growth factor action, this is a quantitative phenomenon, and competitive antagonists of growth factor action of sufficiently high affinity may provide effective and specific adjuvants to the treatment of such tumors.","['Orban, P C', 'Schrader, J W']","['Orban PC', 'Schrader JW']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 1;156(9):3334-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although perforin has been purified from killer lymphocytes and the coding gene has been cloned and sequenced, information concerning the domain structure of the perforin molecule has remained scarce. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of perforin and to further assess the functional relevance of the N-terminal portion of the perforin molecule in its lytic activity, we have attempted in the present study to produce recombinant perforins. Three forms of recombinant mouse perforin, a full-length form and two N-terminal truncated forms, have been expressed in insect (Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)) cells using recombinant baculovirus. Biochemical and functional characterization showed the purified full-length recombinant perforin to be capable of lysing target cells, inducing Ca2+ influx into target cells, and forming structural pores in target membranes. Significant lytic activities were also detected for the two truncated recombinant perforins lacking, respectively, the N-terminal 21 amino acid residues and 121 amino acid residues. Time course study showed that the latter acted less efficiently than the former. These results suggest the N-terminal portion of the perforin molecule to be an important, but not the only, domain responsible for the lytic function of the perforin molecule.","['Liu, C C', 'Persechini, P M', 'Young, J D']","['Liu CC', 'Persechini PM', 'Young JD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Cell Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology/ultrastructure', 'Spodoptera/cytology/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 1;156(9):3292-300.,,,,['CA47307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we report that CD28-mediated cytotoxicity of YT involves tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the Tec kinase Itk/Emt, and protein kinase C (PKC). YT mediates lysis of CD80+/CD86+ B lymphoblastoid cell lines and the murine mastocytoma p815 transfected with CD80 or CD86. The lysis was inhibited by two different Pi 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. The PKC inhibitors calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X also abolished YT-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, exocytosis of cytolytic effector molecules was also inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors and PKC inhibitors. PMA together with Ionomycin did not induce granule exocytosis or cytotoxicity by YT cells. Treatment of YT cells with PMA for up to 20 h, which depleted PMA-responsive PKC isoforms, had no effect on the CD28-mediated cytotoxicity. This cytotoxicity displayed by PMA-treated YT cells, however, could still be inhibited by Pi 3-kinase inhibitors and PKC inhibitors. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which activation of CD28 and LFA-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain, recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase, as well as the Tec kinase Itk/Emt, and the activation of PMA-nonresponsive PKC isoenzymes. Activation of PI 3-kinase and PMA-nonresponsive PKC isoenzymes is shown to be involved directly in cytolytic granule release by YT cells.","['Teng, J M', 'Liu, X R', 'Mills, G B', 'Dupont, B']","['Teng JM', 'Liu XR', 'Mills GB', 'Dupont B']","['The Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD28 Antigens/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 May 1;156(9):3222-32.,,,,"['AI37294/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the 21-bp repeats contain nucleotide sequences which are homologous to a cAMP response element (CRE) which bind members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. In this study, we investigated whether CREB alone or in the presence of Tax was able to induce DNA structural changes when bound to CRE sites in the HTLV-I 21 bp, the cellular somatostatin promoter, or a hybrid CRE construct comprised of both the somatostatin and 21-bp repeat sequences. Circular permutation analysis indicated that CREB was able to induce DNA flexure upon binding to each of these elements. However, phasing analysis, which is a more sensitive method to determine the degree and orientation of directed DNA bending, demonstrated that CREB induced DNA bending of the HTLV-I 21-bp repeat and the hybrid CRE but not the somatostatin CRE. The addition of Tax did not change CREB-mediated bending of the 21-bp repeat or the hybrid CRE although it markedly increased the amount of CREB bound to each of these DNA elements. These results indicate that sequence motifs flanking the CRE in the 21-bp repeat are critical for inducing DNA structural changes and that these changes are likely important in mediating Tax activation of the HTLV-I LTR.","['Yin, M J', 'Paulssen, E', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Yin MJ', 'Paulssen E', 'Gaynor RB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Somatostatin/genetics', 'TATA Box']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.9.4781 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)82513-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 1;271(9):4781-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.9.4781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Grb2 in v-Abl-transformed cells, whereas Shc in NIH3T3 cells is phosphorylated solely on serine and is not Grb2-associated. In addition, Shc coprecipitates with P120 v-Abl and P70 v-Abl, which lacks the carboxyl terminus. Surprisingly, a kinase-defective mutant of P120 also binds Shc, demonstrating that Shc/v-Abl association is a phosphotyrosine-independent interaction. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were used to map the interacting domains and showed that Shc from both NIH3T3 and v-Abl-transformed cells binds to the Abl SH2 domain and that P120 v-Abl binds to a region in the amino terminus of Shc. Consistent with these data, a v-Abl mutant encoding only the Gag and SH2 regions was able to bind Shc in vivo. The unique non-phosphotyrosine-mediated binding of Shc may allow direct tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by v-Abl and subsequent activation of the Ras pathway through assembly of a signaling complex with Grb2-mSos.","['Raffel, G D', 'Parmar, K', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Raffel GD', 'Parmar K', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Genes, abl', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*src Homology Domains']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.9.4640 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)82493-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 1;271(9):4640-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.9.4640.,,,,['CA24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intermediate and high-grade B-cell neoplasms.,373-80,"Previous studies have reported that low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders have variable B-cell monoclonality detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. For instance, monoclonal B-cell populations from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma are most often readily amplified with a single primer pair, whereas follicular lymphomas and plasma cell neoplasms require alternative strategies to approach these higher diagnostic sensitivity standards. Because most published reports have not focused on the variation in PCR B-cell monoclonality detection among subtypes of intermediate and high-grade B-cell neoplasms, additional information is necessary to determine primer selection strategies and identify problematic tumor subtypes within this group. The current investigation, the third part in a series, was aimed at documenting the efficiency of B-cell monoclonality detection by PCR in 71 aggressive B-cell neoplasms of various types using a comprehensive approach. A predetermined panel of primer sets was used in an algorithmic fashion. Specifically, all samples were analyzed with the standard VH-FRIII/JH assay previously shown to have the highest efficiency of monoclonality detection within low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Negative samples were further evaluated with primer sets in the following order until a positive result was observed, or all primer sets were used: (1) bcl-2/JH, (2) VH-FRI family specific/JH, and (3) VH-FRI consensus/JH. Forty-three (61%) of the 71 B-cell neoplasms evaluated with VH-FRIII/JH showed monoclonal B-cell populations. Sequential use of the three reserve primer sets in samples negative with this initial primer pair resulted in an overall improvement in PCR detection from 61% to 82% (58 of 71 specimens) (P < .001). The VH-FRI family specific assay identified B-cell monoclonality in 11 (73%) of these 15 specimens and was the most productive reserve primer set. Individual categories exhibited the following initial (I) and final (F) PCR detection rates: acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, 11 specimens (I = 91% to F = 91%); small noncleaved cell lymphoma, 14 specimens (I = 79% to F = 86% [P > .25]); diffuse large cell lymphoma, 33 specimens (I = 52% to F= 85% [P < .005]) and large cell, immunoblastic lymphoma, 13 specimens (I = 38% to F = 62% [P < .01]). The authors have shown that comprehensive PCR analysis is capable of detecting B-cell monoclonality in a significant proportion of samples from each subtype of intermediate and high-grade B-cell neoplasm. The VH-FRIII/JH assay was an adequate initial primer set, but required augmentation with the reserve PCR assays to attenuate the false negative rate and improve diagnostic sensitivity. The B-cell clonality PCR assay is optimally used as a screening tool and when used in this fashion, the more laborious and time-consuming restriction fragment-Southern blot hybridization (RF-SBH) method for IgH gene rearrangement detection may be limited to a relatively small proportion of PCR-negative aggressive B-cell neoplasms.","['Lombardo, J F', 'Hwang, T S', 'Maiese, R L', 'Millson, A', 'Segal, G H']","['Lombardo JF', 'Hwang TS', 'Maiese RL', 'Millson A', 'Segal GH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Primers', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(96)90111-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90111-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1996 Apr;27(4):373-80. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90111-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carp head kidney cells isolated at a density of 1.09 g/mL contained more than 90% neutrophilic granulocytes. These cells were round and approximately 10 millimicrons in diameter with reniform or polymorphic nuclei and slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm when stained with Giemsa. Electron microscopy revealed that the cytoplasm contained numerous oval granules, some of which contained a dense rod-shaped core. The neutrophilic granulocytes readily formed conjugates with the human target cells and rapidly killed them. The neutrophilic granulocytes killed human derived target cells better than murine derived target cells. Inhibition of cytotoxicity by catalase suggested that the production of H2O2 is involved as a mediator in the cytotoxic reaction.

Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and RANTES, but not interleukin (IL)-8, induce the generation of cytolytic cells, designated here as CHAK (CC chemokine-activated killer) cells to distinguish them from IL-2-activated (LAK) cells. Like IL-2, CC chemokines can induce the proliferation and activation of killer cells. While incubating CC chemokines with CD4+ or CD8+ cells did not generate CHAK activity, all CC chemokines were capable of inducing CHAK activity upon incubating with CD56+ cells, suggesting that the primary effectors are NK cells. However, the presence of other cell types, such as CD4+ or CD8+, are necessary to induce the proliferation of CD56+ cells. Confirming the involvement of T cell-derived factors in inducing the proliferation of these cells, anti-IL-2 and anti-interferon-gamma, but not anti-IL-1 beta, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, anti-IL-8, or anti-granulocyte/monocyte-colony-stimulating factor inhibited RANTES-induced proliferation of nylon wool column-nonadherent cells.

In this study we have analysed the structural requirements for transcriptional activation by BSAP. In vitro mutagenesis and transient transfection experiments indicate that the C-terminal serine/threonine/proline-rich region of BSAP contains a potent transactivation domain of 55 amino acids which is active from promoter and enhancer positions. This transactivation domain was found to be inactivated by a naturally occurring frameshift mutation in one PAX-5 allele of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line REH. The function of the transactivation domain is negatively regulated by adjacent sequences from the extreme C-terminus. The activating and inhibitory domains function together as an independent regulatory module in different cell types as shown by fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The same arrangement of positively and negatively acting sequences has been conserved in the mammalian Pax-2 and Pax-8, the zebrafish Pax-b as well as the sea urchin Pax-258 proteins.

Treatment of the cells with high concentrations of PMA (100 nM) favours myelomonocytic differentiation, while lower concentrations (20 nM) induce predominantly eosinophil differentiation. Here we have investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in this process and found that 100 nM, but not 20 nM, PMA dramatically down-regulates total cellular PKC activity, indicating that high PMA concentrations result in less efficient signalling than lower PMA concentrations. Consistent with these findings is the observation that very low PMA concentrations (1 nM), which presumably only moderately activate PKC, induce myeloid differentiation. This suggests the existence of two PKC thresholds which play a role in lineage commitment. To test the model, alpha- and epsilon-PKC isoforms were expressed in E26-transformed progenitors. These cells exhibited myelomonocytic differentiation even in the absence of PMA, while treatment with concentrations of PMA as high as 100 nM led to the differentiation of predominantly eosinophils and failed to downregulate the exogenous PKC. Our results suggest that different levels of PKC activity result in three different phenotypes: (i) no PKC activity maintains the progenitor phenotype; (ii) low PKC activity favours myelomonocytic differentiation; (iii) high PKC favours eosinophil differentiation.","['Rossi, F', 'McNagny, M', 'Smith, G', 'Frampton, J', 'Graf, T']","['Rossi F', 'McNagny M', 'Smith G', 'Frampton J', 'Graf T']","['Differentiation Programme, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Eosinophils/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Apr 15;15(8):1894-901.,,,,,PMC450108,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations suggest that (a) the cellular uptake of both retinoids occurs via the free form of the ligand in solution, with the free concentration of ligand decreasing as the carrier-protein concentration increases, and (b) according to a passive mechanism, the ester derivative, unionized and lipophilic, enters the cells more easily than does the acidic derivative.","['Mouawad, R', 'Urien, S', 'Soubrane, C', 'Khayat, D', 'Brandt, R', 'Tillement, J P', 'Bastian, G']","['Mouawad R', 'Urien S', 'Soubrane C', 'Khayat D', 'Brandt R', 'Tillement JP', 'Bastian G']","[""Service d'Oncologie Medicale, Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '71441-09-3', '(ethyl-p-((E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)-1-propenyl)be', 'nzoic acid)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Benzoates/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Keratolytic Agents/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050471 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(2):198-201. doi: 10.1007/s002800050471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric proteins are encoded by the breakpoint regions of the derivative chromosomes have been proposed to be the relevant oncogenic agents. In addition, internal duplications of the ALL-1 gene have been observed in patients with specific acute myeloid leukemias. Thus, it has been hypothesized that oncogenic variants of the ALL-1 protein may be generated by both chimerization and self-fusion, but the critical structural features endowing the altered proteins with their oncogenic potential are still unknown. Here a novel structural alteration of the ALL-1 gene was observed in three patients presenting with acute T-cell leukemia (ALL) without chromosomal translocations or self-fusions of the ALL-1 gene. These unrelated patients carried an internal deletion in one of the two alleles of the ALL-1 gene that eliminated parts of introns 7 and 8, together with exon 8. The deletion was found in 3 of 74 ALL patients, but not in acute myeloid leukemias, follicular lymphomas, or peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors. One ALL patient showed the deletion at diagnosis but no longer at remission or at 9 months after remission. These findings support the hypothesis that the ALL-1 protein may be converted to an oncogenic variant, not only by chimerization or self-fusion, but also by deletion of sequences coded by exon 8. They further suggest that these three different types of structural alterations of the ALL-1 protein may each cause a distinct disease phenotype. Alternatively spliced mRNA species omitting exon 8 were observed in 14 of 24 ALL patients without detectable macroscopic alterations of the ALL-1 gene and also in peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors.","['Lochner, K', 'Siegler, G', 'Fuhrer, M', 'Greil, J', 'Beck, J D', 'Fey, G H', 'Marschalek, R']","['Lochner K', 'Siegler G', 'Fuhrer M', 'Greil J', 'Beck JD', 'Fey GH', 'Marschalek R']","['Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Markers', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 May 1;56(9):2171-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the internalization, lysosomal targeting, metabolism, and cellular retention of radiolabeled murine and humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting the CD33 antigen (monoclonal antibodies mP67 and hP67, respectively) on myeloid leukemia cell lines (HEL and HL-60) and of anti-carcinoma antibodies (monoclonal antibodies hCTM01 and hA33) targeting breast cancer and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (MCF7 and Colo 205, respectively). Each antibody was labeled with 125I (by the IodoGen method) and with 111In and 90Y using macrocyclic chelation technology. Targeted tumor cells were analyzed for retention and metabolism of radioimmunoconjugates using cellular-radioimmunoassays, Percoll gradient fractionation of cell organelles, SDS-PAGE, and TLC of cell lysates and culture supernatants. Our results suggest that antibodies are routed to lysosomes after endocytosis, where they are proteolytically degraded. [125I]monoiodotyrosine is rapidly excreted from cells after lysosomal catabolism of antibodies radioiodinated by conventional methods, whereas small molecular weight 111In and 90Y catabolites remain trapped in lysosomes. As a consequence of the differential disposition of small molecular weight catabolites, 111In and 90Y conjugates displayed superior retention of radioactivity compared with 125I conjugates when tumor cells were targeted using rapidly internalizing antibody-antigen systems (e.g., hP67 with HEL cells and hCTM01 with MCF7 cells). When tumor cells were targeted using antibody-antigen systems exhibiting slow rates of endocytosis (e.g., hP67 on HL-60 cells and hA33 on Colo 205 cells), little differences in cellular retention of radioactivity was observed, regardless of whether 125I, 111In, or 90Y was used.","['Press, O W', 'Shan, D', 'Howell-Clark, J', 'Eary, J', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Matthews, D', 'King, D J', 'Haines, A M', 'Hamann, P', 'Hinman, L', 'Shochat, D', 'Bernstein, I D']","['Press OW', 'Shan D', 'Howell-Clark J', 'Eary J', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Matthews D', 'King DJ', 'Haines AM', 'Hamann P', 'Hinman L', 'Shochat D', 'Bernstein ID']","['Department of Medicine (Division of Oncology), University of Washington, Seattle 98195-6043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Indium Radioisotopes/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Liposomes', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 May 1;56(9):2123-9.,,,,['P01 CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since subpopulations of normal peripheral blood or bone marrow cells show distinct P-glycoprotein levels, the presence of these cells in leukaemic samples causes a major problem in determination of rhodamine 123 efflux in these types of malignant cells. Additional staining of blasts with specific monoclonal antibodies (marked with FITC (fluorescein) or PE (phycoerythrin) might ensure a selective analysis of a particular subpopulation by flow cytometry, but the emission spectrum of rhodamine 123 interferes with FITC and PE signals and vice versa. This can be avoided by using monoclonal antibodies (mab) conjugated with the newly developed dye PerCP (peridnine chlorophyll protein; Becton/Dickinson), devoid of interfering with the rhodamine 123 fluorescence emission spectrum. Therefore we established an assay for the determination of rhodamine 123 efflux from peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ or CD56+ subpopulations by detection with PerCP-conjugated mab, followed by electronic gating. The problems of varying signal intensities or the need to recompensate during measurement which normally occurred using FITC- or PE-conjugated mab did not emerge by the use of PerCP-marked mab. Moreover we could correlate MDR1 gene expression and modulation of rhodamine 123 efflux from the leukaemic blasts by proven P-gp MDR chemosensitizing agents such as SDZ PSC 833, dexverapamil and dexniguldipine.

The determination of which patients are at low risk for having positive blood cultures and for developing complications related to bacteremia is of potential benefit. METHODS: The records of 161 pediatric patients with neoplastic disease hospitalized for 509 episodes of fever and neutropenia between January 1990 and June 1992 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features at initial presentation, clinical and microbiologic documentation of infection, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The only presenting clinical features that correlated with an increased likelihood of having positive blood cultures were chills, hypotension, the requirement for fluid resuscitation (P < 0.001), or a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (P < 0.041). Leukemia patients with relapse admitted for fever and neutropenia were no more likely to have positive blood cultures than those patients in remission. There were ten episodes of fever and neutropenia in which patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and two sepsis related deaths. Nine episodes involving ICU management and both deaths were in patients who had persistent fever and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 100 after 48 hours of hospitalization (n = 177). Patients with an ANC of less than 100 after 48 hours were twice as likely to have antibiotic changes, 15 times more likely to receive amphotericin B, and were hospitalized twice as long as patients with an ANC of 100 or higher after 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Children hospitalized for fever and neutropenia who have persistent fever and an ANC of less than 100 after 48 hours are at high risk for morbidity and are more likely to require antibiotic changes and antifungal therapy. Children who initially lack signs of sepsis, are afebrile, and have an ANC of 100 or higher after 48 hours are at low risk for complications and could be selectively discharged on antimicrobials after a 48-hour period of inpatient hospitalization.","['Lucas, K G', 'Brown, A E', 'Armstrong, D', 'Chapman, D', 'Heller, G']","['Lucas KG', 'Brown AE', 'Armstrong D', 'Chapman D', 'Heller G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Fever', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Hypotension', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/blood/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/blood/*physiopathology', '*Neutropenia', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology']",1996/02/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960215)77:4<791::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Feb 15;77(4):791-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival varied significantly among the five counties that make up the region (P = 0.0008); the differences were greatest for central nervous system (CNS) tumors. METHODS: The expertise of local hospitals and entrance into national trials was examined. The region has nine hospitals acting as primary treatment hospitals for children with cancer, two neurosurgical units, and one regional oncology unit. Four of the primary hospitals saw more than six children per year and were designated ""large"" centers. Five saw fewer than six patients per year and were designated ""small"" hospitals. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in survival of patients according to the number of patients treated per year per hospital. A hospital that treated fewer than six patients per year was designated ""small"" and six or more designated ""large."" At 5 years, patients with CNS tumors experienced a 58% survival rate in large hospitals and a 41% survival rate in small hospitals. (P = 0.03). The rate of entrance into trials for all malignancies did not differ between large (30%) and small (27%) centers. Only 5% of children with CNS tumors were placed on national trials. There was no difference in survival rates for CNS tumors in the two neurosurgical centers. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in survival by county for children with cancer, especially those with CNS tumors. In the first half of the study decade, in hospitals treating fewer than six cases of childhood cancer per year, children with CNS tumors were rarely placed on national protocols and did poorly.","['Foreman, N K', 'Thorne, R N', 'Mott, M G']","['Foreman NK', 'Thorne RN', 'Mott MG']","['The Department of Pediatric Oncology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Demography', 'England', 'Hospital Bed Capacity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1996/02/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960215)77:4<785::AID-CNCR26>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19960215)77:4<785::aid-cncr26>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Feb 15;77(4):785-90. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19960215)77:4<785::aid-cncr26>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A survey of total and site specific cancer incidence among 7016 male and female adult residents from 1959-1987 was conducted, and the observed number compared with the expected number, based on the age-sex-race-calendar period-and site-specific cancer incidence rates reported by the Connecticut tumor registry. Based on the results of this survey, a hypothesis was advanced concerning the potential risks of exposures to insecticides and herbicides. This was pursued by analyzing for each county in Michigan the comparative annual number of acres and percentage of acreage treated with agricultural chemicals in 1978 and for the period 1982-1987. Finally, because of the availability of information on lifestyle risk factors that had been collected in the 1960s on all participants, a nested case-control study was implemented. RESULTS: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), based on the observed number divided by the expected number of invasive cancer cases (all sites combined [excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer]), was not significant in females (SIR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.05) nor males (SIR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81-1.01). A significant increase was demonstrated for males and females combined in the incidence of lymphopoietic neoplasms, namely non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; the combined SIR was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.03-1.86; P = 0.03). In the Department of Commerce surveys of counties in Michigan, the Tecumseh area (Lenawee County) was ranked highest with respect to the average annual number of acres (240,000 or more) and the percent of acreage (40%) sprayed with herbicides and insecticides. A comparison of temporal trends for cancer incidence since 1973 was reviewed for the Wayne-Oakland-Macomb tricounty area, in which the survey estimated that less than 80,000 acres per year, or less than 8% of acreage, were treated with pesticides. The comparison of the Tecumseh cohort, for all sites combined, was not significantly different from expectation in females (SIR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.14), and was decreased by more than 10% in males (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00). However, the SIR for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in females was significantly elevated (SIR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.07-3.11, P = 0.02); the trend for increased risks of lymphomas and leukemias was also evident in males. In the nested case-control study, based on risk factor information documented prior to diagnosis, the relative risk of a family history of lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma was significantly increased among patients with lymphoproliferative neoplasms (odds ratio, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.49-9.79; P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective epidemiologic study conducted in a rural farming community in Michigan has found significant increases in the incidence dence of lymphoproliferative cancers. A plausible hypothesis, consistent with the preliminary findings, is that the reported cancer pattern is an expression of risk resulting from sustained environmental exposures to agricultural chemicals, perhaps in conjunction with familial or genetic factors.","['Waterhouse, D', 'Carman, W J', 'Schottenfeld, D', 'Gridley, G', 'McLean, S']","['Waterhouse D', 'Carman WJ', 'Schottenfeld D', 'Gridley G', 'McLean S']","['Oncology Consultants, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Insecticides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Connecticut/epidemiology', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Herbicides', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Insecticides', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', '*Rural Population', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.1996.2820770402 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Feb 15;77(4):763-70. doi: 10.1002/cncr.1996.2820770402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined five patients with B-cell lymphoma who relapsed more than 5 years after initial presentation. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were analyzed for clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR products. Four specimens retained the original histologic type, but one showed histologic transformation from diffuse large cell lymphoma to follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma. RESULTS: Although the size of the PCR products looked identical on the gel between presentation and relapse in all patients, only three of the four specimens that retained the original type had identical gene rearrangements at both presentation and relapse. One of these four and the fifth specimen showed novel gene rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that late relapse lymphoma may present as a new clone.

Here we describe that doxorbicin induces apoptosis via the CD95/CD95-L system in human leukemia T-cell lines. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by inhibition of gene expression and protein synthesis. Also, doxorbicin strongly stimulates CD95-L messenger RNA expression in vitro at concentrations relevant for therapy in vivo. CEM and jurkat cells resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis were also resistant to doxorbicin-induced apoptosis . Furthermore, doxorbicin-induced apoptosis was inhibited by blocking F(ab')2 anti-APO-1 (anti-CD95) antibody fragments. Expression of CD95-L mRNA and protein in vitro was also stimulated by other cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate.

Initially, the percentage of Ph-positive metaphases in marrow for both patients was 100%, which steadily diminished up to a complete disappearance in case 1 and decreased dramatically in case 2 following hypoplasia. Thereafter Southern blot and RT-PCR assays revealed no abnormalities. Both patients have survived 9 years and remained in good clinical and haematological remission without any treatment until recently. We believe that the high sensitivity to busulphan therapy result in hypoplasia and karyotype conversion, which contributed to prolonged survival.","['Xue, Y', 'Zhou, X J', 'Yu, F', 'Gu, J', 'Guo, Y', 'Xie, X', 'Lin, B']","['Xue Y', 'Zhou XJ', 'Yu F', 'Gu J', 'Guo Y', 'Xie X', 'Lin B']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Suzhou, P.

These 29 acute leukaemias exhibiting TCR delta gene rearrangements were selected from 66 Ly+ AML, 14 My+ T-ALL and 12 My(-) T-ALL cases. Similar recombination patterns, namely D delta 2J delta1 and V delta 1J delta1 gene rearrangements, were observed in Ly+ AML and My+T-ALL. In contrast to V delta2 D delta3 rearrangements in B-cell precursor ALL, these rearrangements require activation of a T-cell-specific TCR delta enhancer. Comparison of My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML with My(-) T-ALL exhibited a higher incidence of incomplete D delta 2J delta1 rearrangements in My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML. Since a D delta 2J delta1 rearrangement is an early event in TCR delta recombination, these leukaemias seem to be arrested at an earlier stage of differentiation. Similar patterns of TCR delta rearrangements in My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML suggest existence of a common myeloid/T-lymphoid progenitor cell. Although weak or missing expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (T delta T) was found in 7/10 Ly+ AML cases, no difference was observed in numbers of N-nucleotides inserted in junctional regions when comparing with 3/10 cases exhibiting TdT expression. Since TdT activity is necessary for N-nucleotide addition, this finding suggests down-regulation of T delta T expression after rearrangement took place in these Ly+ AML cases.","['Schmidt, C A', 'Przybylski, G', 'Tietze, A', 'Oettle, H', 'Siegert, W', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Schmidt CA', 'Przybylski G', 'Tietze A', 'Oettle H', 'Siegert W', 'Ludwig WD']","['Virchow Klinikum, Abt.

A suppression of cells expressing these phenotypes after initiation of therapy was followed by an outgrowth of normal precursor B cells after 12 months. Therefore this early test for impending relapse (which occurred 10-28 months after starting chemotherapy) was only applicable in the first year after beginning the treatment. However, despite this predictive value, comparison of fluorescence data with PCR results obtained from the same BM sample indicated that only a subpopulation of the CD34+ CD10+ CD19+ and CD34+ CD20- CD22+ cells above the determined threshold value represented malignant cells.

After chemotherapy, plasma G-CSF was elevated (mean 5.6 ng/ml; range 1.2-10 ng/ml), and was inversely correlated with white blood cell counts (WBC) (r=-0.7, p<0.001). Occurrence of fever (T>38.0 degrees C) during severe myelosuppression (WBC<1x10(9)/1) was associated with an additional increase of G-CSF levels (P<0. (P<0.001). Plasma IL-6 correlated significantly with fever (range <1 to 1100 pg/ml, mean 130 pg/ml; r=0.5, P<0.001) but revealed only a weak association with WBC or platelet counts. In patients treated with recombinant G-CSF (n = 9), an association between IL-6 and fever was still observed after chemotherapy. During the nonfebrile status (total n = 242; AML n = 124), IL-6 levels remained <9 pg/ml in 90% of cases, whereas G-CSF increased with leucopenia (r = -0.72;P<0.001). In contrast, endogenous GM-CSF remained normal and IL-10 showed only a slight increase (21% of samples; maximum 22 pg/ml) in severe leucopenia. In particular, IL-10 levels did not correlate with G-CSF or IL-6 levels. We conclude that systemic release of G-CSF and IL-6 is obviously nit abrogated by cytoreductive chemotherapy in acute leukaemia and NHL may add to the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant cytokines. Also, plasma levels of G-, GM-CSF or IL-6 appear to be regulated by separate mechanisms.","['Reisbach, G', 'Kamp, T', 'Welzl, G', 'Geiz, C', 'Abedinpour Fariborz', 'Lodri, A', 'Kaboth, W', 'Dormer, P', 'Nerl, C']","['Reisbach G', 'Kamp T', 'Welzl G', 'Geiz C', 'Abedinpour Fariborz', 'Lodri A', 'Kaboth W', 'Dormer P', 'Nerl C']","['Gsf- Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit, Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.434972.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(4):907-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.434972.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO positive, t(8;21) negative cases are well recognized but their incidence is unknown. In order to determine optimal prospective AML1-ETO RT-PCR screening strategies, we analysed 64 unselected AML M1 and M2 cases and correlated the results with other biological parameters. Molecular screening increased the overall detection rate from 8% to 14%. AML1-ETO was found in 3% (1/32) of AML M1 and 25% (8/32) of M2, including three patients without a classic (8;21) but with chromosome 8 abnormalities. It was more common in younger patients. Correlation with morphology enabled development of a scoring system which detected all nine AML1-ETO-positive cases with a false positive rate of 7% (4/55). Although certain AML1-ETO-positive cases demonstrated characteristic immunological features (CD19 and CD34 expression, CD33 negativity), each of these markers was insufficiently specific to permit prediction in an individual case.

Whether expression of the recently described multidrug resistance-associated gene (mrp) has any prognostic importance in AML is still unclear.

Peripheral leukaemic cells from 10 patients with AML were incubated with daunorubicin (DNR). Cellular DNR content was analysed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). From each cell population the 20-25% cells with the lowest and highest DNR content were sorted out, and mdr1 and mrp RNA were quantified in these subpopulations with competitive polymerase chain reaction. The ratio between the mean DNR content in the cell populations with high and low DNR content varied between 1.9 and 6.6. the cell fraction with low DNR content had higher (3.8-40 times)mdr1 mRNA levels in 10/10 patients and higher (1.4-26 times) mrp mRNA levels in 8/10, as compared to the cell fraction with high DNR accumulation.

The mdr1 expression, and to some extent mrp expression, is inversely correlated to DNR accumulation in vitro.","['Xu, D', 'Knaust, E', 'Pisa, P', 'Palucka, K', 'Lundeberg, J', 'Arestrom, I', 'Peterson, C', 'Gruber, A']","['Xu D', 'Knaust E', 'Pisa P', 'Palucka K', 'Lundeberg J', 'Arestrom I', 'Peterson C', 'Gruber A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.425963.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(4):847-54. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.425963.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finnish Leukaemia Group.,834-9,"DAta from an 8-year follow-up of 432 myeloma patients were analysed for incidence, duration and prognostic value of plateau phase and factors favouring its achievement. The first-line chemotherapy was melphalan and prednisolone in 121 cases, combination chemotherapy in 311 cases. The survival times were similar despite different response rates. Any response resulted in survival significantly (P<0.001) better than in patients with progressive disease, but the level of response had no influence in this respect. A plateau of at least 3 months was achieved in 81%, at least 6 months in 74%, at least 12 months in 59% and at least 24 months in 33%. Groups with significantly different (P<0.001) survivals were identified: a plateau of <3 months, 3-11 months, 12-23 months, and 24 months or longer, with median survivals of 10, 27, 46 and 81 months, respectively. In the multivariate analysis of pretreatment variables, only haemoglobin (Hb) (P<0.001) and creatinine at 2 months (P<0.01) were significant for a plateau >12 months. After inclusion of chemotherapy data, Hb and time taken to reach the best response were still significant (P=0.002). The predictive power of high Hb and slow response for achieving a plateau of 6 or 12 months was 79%. Accordingly, the criteria for response of treatment for multiple myeloma should include a stable period of at least 3 months; the criteria for a plateau a stable period of at least 12 months in order to have real prognostic significance.","['Oivanen, T M']",['Oivanen TM'],"['Finnish Leukaemia Group, Department of Oncology, Tampere University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.413952.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(4):834-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.413952.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to see how the proteolytic state associated with APL affects VWF structure and function and whether ATRA reverses any abnormality. At the onset of APL, multimeric analysis of plasma VWF revealed a lack of the largest multimers. After ATRA, there was a progressive correction of the multimeric pattern in all cases, with transient appearance of ultralarge multimers in two cases. Proteolysis was investigated with immunopurified and reduced VWF from each patient's plasma. This was electrophoresed and probed with two monoclonal antibodies that identify the 225 kD native subunit and the three native fragments of 189, 176 and 140 kD and differentiate novel proteolytic fragments produced by different proteinases. At the onset of APL, the 225 kD native subunit was relatively decreased, with the appearance of an array of novel VWF proteolytic fragments, ranging in size from <140 to <225 kD. These novel fragments observed in patients were similar to those produced in vitro by digestion of purified VWF with plasmin or elastase. After ATRA therapy, proteolysis diminished progressively in parallel with the improvement of other haemostatic measurements, but persisted to some extent. We conclude that VWF proteolysis in APL is produced by plasmin and elastase. Changes of VWF structure and function might adversely affect haemostasis in APL. Therefore, improvement of VWF after ATRA administration might explain in part the effectiveness of this drug in reducing haemorrhagic complications.","['Federici, A B', 'Falanga, A', 'Lattuada, A', 'Di Rocco, N', 'Barbui, T', 'Mannucci, P M']","['Federici AB', 'Falanga A', 'Lattuada A', 'Di Rocco N', 'Barbui T', 'Mannucci PM']","['Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'von Willebrand Factor/*metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.401939.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(3):733-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.401939.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have tested 209 Ph-positive CML patients for expression of ABL-BCR, BCR-ABL and the normal BCR and ABL genes by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR).

These genes have been found to be homozygously deleted at a high frequency in several types of solid tumours and also in acute lymphoid leukaemias. In order to determine whether these genes are more widely involved in haematological malignancies, we have investigated a total of 84 samples that did not have homozygous p16 or p15 deletions from patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia (n=13), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=24) and chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (n=43) as well as four haemopoietic cell lines. p15 and p16 exon 1 and exon 2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), analysed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and subsequently by sequencing. Within the p16 gene, a G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 436 was found in 3/80 (4%) leukaemias and the cell line HL60.

Two patients had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). FAB M5a, one had pro-B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The interval between initiation of chemotherapy and the onset of secondary acute leukaemia was 19-20 months. 11q23 rearrangements were detected in all cases. They were due to translocations t(11;19) (q23;p13.3), t(11;16)(q23;p13) and t(4;11)(q21;q23), respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC) probe 13HH4 spanning the ALL-1 gene on 11q23 confirmed that in each case the ALL-1 gene had been disrupted by the translocations. The study underlined the relationship between the development of secondary acute leukaemias with 11q23 rearrangement and previous chemotherapy with topisomerase II inhibitor agents. So far, however, only six adult patients with secondary ALL with t(4;11) after treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitor agents have been reported. All with t(4;11) mostly occurs in infants or young children. Our patient received epirubicin continuously for >19 months. This indicates that both myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias with involvement of the ALL-1 gene can be induced by exogenous agents, especially topoisomerase II inhibitors. Thus they may have a common biological background. This hypothesis was substantiated by means of combined immunophenotyping and FISH (FICTION). In the case of AML M5a with t(11;19), the tumour cells with ALL-1 rearrangement expressed CD34. Moreover, the pro-B-ALL with t(4;11) was CD34 positive. These findings suggest that the cell of origin of secondary AML and ALL with 11q23 rearrangement is an immature haemopoietic progenitor cell.","['Zhang, Y', 'Poetsch, M', 'Weber-Matthiesen, K', 'Rohde, K', 'Winkemann, M', 'Haferlach, T', 'Gassmann, W', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Grote, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Schlegelberger, B']","['Zhang Y', 'Poetsch M', 'Weber-Matthiesen K', 'Rohde K', 'Winkemann M', 'Haferlach T', 'Gassmann W', 'Ludwig WD', 'Grote W', 'Loffler H', 'Schlegelberger B']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00399.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(3):673-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00399.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements to immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) result in a deregulation of the gene and increased transcription of mRNA for the bcl-2 protein. In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) expression of bcl-2 protein is increased but rearrangement of the gene can be found only in a minority of cases: commonly a variant translocation with a breakpoint region located 5' of the bcl-2 gene (vcr) with preferential rearrangement to immunoglobulin light chain genes. We have analysed breakpoints in mbr and vcr in malignant cells from 96 patients with B-CLL, 45 with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and 41 with high- and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Vcr rearrangements were observed in nine patients (12%) with B-CLL. Four patients had co-migration of rearranged bcl-2 bands to kappa genes and two patients to IgH. Cytogenetic abnormalities involving 18q21, the site of the bcl-2 gene, was found in two cases only. In several cases with bcl-2 gene rearrangement chromosomal aberrations not including 18q21 were observed. In six patients (two B-CLL, one follicular lymphoma, one immunocytoma and two high-grade lymphomas), breakpoints in both vcr and mbr were found. In HCL a rearrangement in the vcr region was found in one case. Bcl-2 protein immunostaining of B-CLL showed intense bcl-2 expression in all cases and no correlation was found between gene rearrangement and protein expression. Our study confirms that breakpoints in the bcl-2 gene commonly cluster to the vcr region in B-CLL, but in most cases over-expression of bcl-2 protein has to be explained by other mechanisms than bcl-2 gene rearrangement.

We studied 95 patients with ATL to elucidate the relationship between the multiple integrations of HTLV-I and the clinical characteristics. The proviral DNA of HTLV-I was examined by standard Southern blot analysis using the probe of an entire HTLV-I genome and the endonucleases with or without cleavage sites within the provirus. Multiple integrations of HTLV-I were detected in eight patients as extraordinary multiple bands; five patients showed multiple bands of the same intensity, and the remaining three showed multiple bands of differing intensities. The patients were divided into two groups based on these band patterns. One group was considered to exhibit one tumour cell clone carrying multiple copies of the provirus, whereas the other was considered to exhibit multiple tumour cell clones, each carrying one copy of the provirus. The former group of patients manifested a highly aggressive clinical course with frequent peculiar organ infiltrations, including the retina, uvea and muscle, along with the presence of large peripheral leukaemic T cells having flower-like nuclei. The latter group demonstrated an indolent clinical course with skin lesions or small leukaemic T cells having cleaved or lobulated nuclei.

We conclude that serum LDH is a main prognostic factor in AML of the elderly and a potentially useful tool for identifying subsets of patients who may obtain a substantial advantage from aggressive chemotherapy.","['Ferrara, F', 'Mirto, S']","['Ferrara F', 'Mirto S']","['Division of Haematology, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00398.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(3):627-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00398.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-2-induced killing of AML blasts was inhibited by monocytes, recovered from peripheral blood by centrifugal elutriation. Histamine, of concentrations within the micromolar range, abrogated the monocyte-induced inhibition of NK-cells; thereby, histamine and IL-2 synergistically induced NK-cell-mediated killing of AML blasts. The effect of histamine was apparently mediated by H2-type histamine receptors (H2R), since the H2R antagonist ranitidine completely blocked the response. Based on these in vitro findings, seven patients with AML in first (n=2), second (n=3) or third (n=2) complete remission (CR) were given home therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2; O.9 x 10(6) IU x 2 s.c.) and histamine (0.4 - 0.7 mg x 2 s.c.) in cycles of 21 d, separated by 6-week intervals. The patients also received treatment with low dose cytarabine and thioguanine between cycles of histamine/IL-2. Toxicity was moderate and include local reactions to IL-2 at the site of injection and short-lasting flush, hypotension, and headache to histamine. The addition of histamine to treatment with IL-2 significantly enhanced the accumulation of CD25+ T cells in peripheral blood as compared to treatment with IL-2 alone (P< 0.003). Five patients remain in complete remission at 9, 18, 21, 24 and 26 months; the two patients in CR3 relapsed after 8 and 33 months, respectively. In the five patients with earlier relapse, the duration of remission after treatment with histamine/IL-2 has in each case exceeded that of previous remissions. We conclude that (i) histamine and IL-2 synergize to kill human AML blasts in vitro, and (ii) histamine/IL-2 is a safe and feasible approach to immunotherapy of AML which merits further investigation.","['Brune, M', 'Hellstrand, K']","['Brune M', 'Hellstrand K']","[""Department of Haematology, Sahlgren's University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Histamine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00389.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(3):620-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00389.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two independent IFN-alpha signalling pathways were identified: the classic pathway mediates induction of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 OAS), p68 kinase and IFN regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), whereas the alternate pathway leads to activation of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We investigated whether deficient or imbalanced expression of components of these two pathways is associated with resistance of CML cells to antiproliferative action of IFN alpha/beta. Constitutive and IFN-induced transcript levels of IFN-dependent genes in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and CD34+ cells of chronic-phase CML and blast crisis patients were assessed by Northern blot techniques and were correlated with subsequent clinical responses to IFN therapy. Our results demonstrated that IFN-alpha or -beta treatment in vitro and in vivo leads to an enhanced expression of IRF-1, IRF-2. RNase L, p68 and 2-5 OAS which was independent of the degree of cellular differentiation and clonal evolution of CML. Neither the magnitude of induction of these genes nor the IRF-1/IRF-2 mRNA balance differed between chronic-phase CML patients responding or failing IFN-alpha therapy. These results indicate that failure of IFN-alpha treatment is not due to defects in mRNA induction of the above-mentioned candidate genes for the direct antiproliferative response to IFN type I.","['Fischer, T', 'Aman, J', 'van der Kuip, H', 'Rudolf, G', 'Peschel, C', 'Aulitzky, W E', 'Huber, C']","['Fischer T', 'Aman J', 'van der Kuip H', 'Rudolf G', 'Peschel C', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Huber C']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine III, The Johannes Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*metabolism"", 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00392.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Mar;92(3):595-603. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00392.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 11 patients studied, HLA-matched siblings had a higher HTLPf to leukaemia than the patient's autologous response (P < 0.004). Alloresponse in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), and autologous HTLPf to leukaemia, were comparable at all stages of disease progression and time from diagnosis, and independent of treatment given. In order to generate autologous cytotoxic lymphocyte responses to CML, lymphocytes were stimulated with CML cells. Cultures were fed again with CML cells and examined for cytotoxicity after 21 d. Strong lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytotoxicity was found against K562 and Daudi cell lines, and to Epstein-Barr virus-transformed allogeneic and autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines. Autologous leukaemia cells were lysed to a lesser extent in only 3/13 patients tested. The findings indicate that immune reactivity in CML is normal but suggest that CML cells are relatively resistant to lysis by cytotoxic T cells.

Consequently the numbers of subcolonies vary amongst individual bursts.

This provides a means for quantitating the probability of erythroid differentiation (pD) and the probability of renewal (1 - pD). In order to determine whether these kinetics of burst formation can be influenced by exogenous factors we used three commercially available media designed for the growth of BFU-E. We found that subcolony numbers per burst ranged from one to 64 and that the cumulative distributions of subcolonies per burst followed a logarithmic curve (r > 0.90). Differences were observed in the distribution of subcolonies per burst when BFU-E were grown in different media (P=0.03; Kruskall-Wallis test). The probability of immediate terminal differentiation (i.e. committment to form a subcolony) was 0.25 for two of the media and 0.7 for the third.

Evidence was found demonstrating that the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) inhibits cell cycle progression in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells. We also demonstrated that SCLC cells express both CaM kinase type II (CaMKII) and CaM kinase type IV (CaMKIV). Five independent SCLC cell lines expressed proteins reactive with antibody to the CaMKII beta subunit, but none expressed detectable proteins reactive with antibody to the CaMKII alpha subunit. All SCLC cell lines tested expressed both the alpha and beta isoforms of CaMKIV. Immunoprecipitation of CaMKII from SCLC cells yielded multiple proteins that autophosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+ / calmodulin. Autophosphorylation was inhibited by the CaMKII(281-302) peptide, which corresponds to the CaMKII autoinhibitory domain, and by 1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4- phenylpiperazine (KN-62), a specific CaM kinase antagonist. Influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels stimulated phosphorylation of CaMKII in SCLC cells, and this was inhibited by KN-62. Incubation of SCLC cells of KN-62 potently inhibited DNA synthesis, and slowed progression through S phase. Similar anti-proliferative effects of KN-62 occurred in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells, which express both CaMKII and CaMKIV, and in K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, which express CaMKII but not CaMKIV. The expression of both CaMKII and CaMKIV by SCLC cells, and the sensitivity of these cells to the anti-proliferative effects of KN-62, suggest a role for CaM kinase in regulating SCLC proliferation.","['Williams, C L', 'Phelps, S H', 'Porter, R A']","['Williams CL', 'Phelps SH', 'Porter RA']","['Molecular Pharmacology Laboratory, Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA 18840, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '63HM46XPOW (KN 62)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (CAMK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/08 00:00,2000/03/23 09:00,['1996/03/08 00:00'],"['1996/03/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(95)02393-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(95)02393-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Mar 8;51(5):707-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(95)02393-3.,,,,['CA52471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because CPHE and DPH are cationic-amphiphilic and because several substances with such physicochemical properties activate heterotrimeric regulatory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) in a receptor-independent manner, we asked the question of whether or not H1-receptor antagonists could be G-protein activators as well. In dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells, CPHE and DPH increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and azurophilic granule release in pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manners. In HL-60 membranes, PTX-sensitive stimulations of GTPase [E.C. 3.6.1.] and binding of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate by H1 receptor antagonists were observed. CPHE and DPH also increased GTP hydrolysis by the purified PTX-sensitive G-protein, transducin. In all-trans-retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL 2H3 cells), H1-receptor antagonists induced, unlike in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells, Ca2+ influx without Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. CPHE and DPH also induced serotonin release from RBL 2H3 cells. Our data indicate that first-generation H1-receptor antagonists are receptor-independent G-protein activators and that such a mechanism of action accounts for their stimulatory effects in HL-60 cells, basophils, and mast cells.","['Burde, R', 'Dippel, E', 'Seifert, R']","['Burde R', 'Dippel E', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '3U6IO1965U (Chlorpheniramine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Transducin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Chlorpheniramine/pharmacology', 'Diphenhydramine/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transducin/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella']",1996/01/26 00:00,1996/01/26 00:01,['1996/01/26 00:00'],"['1996/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)02123-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)02123-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Jan 26;51(2):125-31. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)02123-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of this blockade. Treatment of MEL cells with N6mAdo inhibited cell growth, prevented accumulation of committed cells, suppressed methylation of total cytoplasmic RNA, and erased the expression of ""memory"" response, an event that precedes initiation of commitment. Furthermore, N6mAdo increased the level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and altered the SAH/SAM ratio that influences methylation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Moreover, analysis of the intracellular extracts revealed that N6-mAdo is converted into S-(N6-methyl)-adenosylhomocysteine (N6-SAH) in MEL cells, an active intermediate that affects methylation of RNA. Therefore, we conclude that N6-mAdo prevents induction of MEL cell differentiation by affecting methylation of critical RNA transcripts involved in expression of ""memory"" and initiation of commitment.

Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR revealed that the main cause of the DAF and/or CD59 deficiency is the failure of mRNA expression in most of the cell lines, except in Ramos(-) in which sufficient mRNA for DAF and CD59 was produced. U937, CEM and TALL cells were not defective in GPI anchor formation as assessed by the detection of other GPI-anchored proteins. No gene abnormality corresponding to DAF or CD59 was detected by Southern blotting. Thus the cause of the defects of DAF and/or CD59 in these leukaemia cell lines except for Ramos(-) is virtually undetectable steady-state levels of the relevant mRNA, most likely attributable to lack of transcription in these cell lines. On the other hand, Ramos(-) cells failed to generate a GPI anchor, whereas they normally expressed DAF and CD59 transcripts. The transfection of phosphatidylinositol-glycan class A (PIG-A) cDNA into Ramos(-) cells restored DAF and CD59 expression, indicating that the defective mechanism in GPI anchor formation is similar to that in paroxysmal noctural haemoglobinuria (PNH) cells, i.e. a deficiency of the PIG-A gene product. Thus the mechanisms of the defects of DAF and/or CD59 in human leukaemia cell lines are not uniform, and in most cases are different from that proposed to cause PNH.","['Hatanaka, M', 'Seya, T', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Hara, T', 'Nonaka, M', 'Inoue, N', 'Takeda, J', 'Shimizu, A']","['Hatanaka M', 'Seya T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Hara T', 'Nonaka M', 'Inoue N', 'Takeda J', 'Shimizu A']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Osaka Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD55 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD59 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Thy-1 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3140969 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Mar 15;314 ( Pt 3):969-76. doi: 10.1042/bj3140969.,,,,,PMC1217151,,,,,,,,,,,,

If this was due either to some conversion of added Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 into Ins(1,4,5)P3 by the 3-phosphatase, or to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 acting as a weak (or partial) agonist on the InsP3 receptor it would be expected that,in the presence of thimerosal to sensitize the InsP3 receptor, the dose-response curve to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 would be left-shifted by the same extent as that of Ins(1,4,5)P3. This was found not to be the case; the dose-response curve to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was not shifted at all by thimerosal. Furthermore, L-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, which can displace radiolabelled D-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 but not D-Ins(1,4,5)P3 from their respective high-affinity binding sites, mimicked the effects of D-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in enhancing the slow phase of Ins(2,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ release. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 caused an increase in magnitude of the slow phase of InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ release leaving the magnitude of the fast phase unaltered, in contrast to increasing Ins(2,4,5)P3 concentrations which increased the size of both phases. In addition, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 decreased the rate constant for the slow phase of Ca2+ release.

We report that these cells, when exposed to thrombin or SFLLRN (the peptide Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn, a thrombin-receptor ligand) rapidly change shape, forming membrane 'blebs', detectable by differential interference contrast or confocal microscopy, as well as labelled 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. The 'blebs' are distinguishable from 'ruffles' or lamellae, since they do not contain phalloidin-detectable actin.

Two forms of PI 3-K, i.e. PI 3-K(gamma) and p85/PI 3-K, regulated by G beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein and the small G-protein Rho, respectively, are present in these cells, as is true for platelets. Wortmannin, a known potent and specific inhibitor of PI 3-K activities, inhibits thrombin-stiumlated accumulation of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 10nM), without affecting phospholipase C activation. Pretreatment of CHRF-288 cells with either wortmannin (100 nM) or an unrelated synthetic PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002 (50 microM), abolishes thrombin-receptor-stimulated blebbing.

The intracellular accumulation and DNA binding of daunorubicin and idarubicin have been studied in human leukaemia K562 cells and their doxorubicin-resistant variant, which presents all features of multidrug resistance. METHODS: This was achieved by measuring the decrease of total drug fluorescence during short-term incubation of cell suspensions, directly in the cuvette of a spectrofluorometer; this quenching is due to intercalation of the drug into DNA and represents an evaluation of the active intracellular concentration of the drugs. RESULTS: Accumulation of both anthracyclines was reduced in resistant cells when compared to sensitive ones. Accumulation of idarubicin was significantly higher than that of daunorubicin in both cell types. The difference in anthracycline accumulation between sensitive and resistant cells was lower for idarubicin than for daunorubicin. Verapamil increased the accumulation of both anthracyclines in resistant cells, with a more pronounced effect for idarubicin. Preincubation of the cells with either drug did not influence the accumulation of the other one. CONCLUSION: It has been shown, with this very rapid technique, that the high potency of idarubicin could be explained, at least in part, by its high level of accumulation, both in sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukaemia cells. This is not due to a lack of activity of P-glycoprotein on idarubicin, but rather to an enhanced influx of this drug compared to daunorubicin.","['Bogush, T', 'Robert, J']","['Bogush T', 'Robert J']","['Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Jan-Feb;16(1):365-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, results showed that the trans complexes induced comparable growth inhibitory properties to those observed for cisplatin and their respective cis isomers. Moreover, retention of activity was observed in a series of 5 acquired platinum drug (cisplatin, carboplatin, iproplatin, tetraplatin and JM149)-resistant L1210 sublines whereas at least partial cross-resistance was observed to the cis isomer JM149 in the acquired carboplatin and iproplatin-resistant lines (in addition to being 11-fold resistant in the line selected for resistance to JM149 itself). In vivo, JM355 showed activity against both the ADJ/PC6 and L1210 models of acquired cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, JM355 was active against an ADJ/PC6 subline possessing resistance to iproplatin and a L1210 subline possessing resistance to its cis isomer JM149. Interestingly, the trans platinum(II) counterpart of JM335(JM334) was inactive in vivo. These data indicate that the trans platinum(IV) complex JM335 possess several in vitro growth inhibitory- and in vivo antitumour properties which are distinct from those observed for cisplatin (or its cis isomer). Thus, JM335 contravenes the original structure-activity rules determined for platinum-containing compounds and, because of its level of activity against cisplatin-resistant tumours, establishes the complex as of interest in the search for new platinum drugs active against cisplatin-resistant disease.","['Goddard, P M', 'Orr, R M', 'Valenti, M R', 'Barnard, C F', 'Murrer, B A', 'Kelland, L R', 'Harrap, K R']","['Goddard PM', 'Orr RM', 'Valenti MR', 'Barnard CF', 'Murrer BA', 'Kelland LR', 'Harrap KR']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (JM 335)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Jan-Feb;16(1):33-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Inhibition of N- or O-glycosylation of proteins during IL-2 activation leads to a 70-80% decrease in the cytolytic activity of LAK cells against K562 and Daudi tumour cells, coinciding with drastic alterations in their cell surface carbohydrate profile. CONCLUSION: The conclusion is drawn that there is a clear correlation between the glycosylation of LAK cell glycoproteins and their anti-tumour activity which points to the involvement of cell surface glycoconjugates in the development of LAK activity.","['Voshol, H', 'Dullens, H F', 'Den Otter, W', 'Vliegenthart, J F']","['Voshol H', 'Dullens HF', 'Den Otter W', 'Vliegenthart JF']","['Utrecht University, Bijvoet Center, Dept. of Bio-Organic Chemistry, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', '3554-93-6 (benzyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine)', 'KM15WK8O5T (Acetylgalactosamine)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",IM,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin/pharmacology', 'Acetylgalactosamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/therapy', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Swainsonine/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Jan-Feb;16(1):155-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing packaging lines for murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors are predominantly derived from NIH/3T3 cells which carry endogenous MLV sequences that could participate in recombination to form replication-competent retrovirus (RCR). To identify cells devoid of such sequences, we screened genomic DNA from eight cell lines. DNA from the human 293 cell line did not cross-hybridize with MLV sequences, and these cells were able to secrete Gag particles after transfection. We derived a stable amphotropic packaging cell line (called ProPak-A) in 293 cells in which the Gag-Pol and Env (packaging) functions are expressed separately from a heterologous (non-MLV) promoter, to maximally reduce homology between packaging and vector sequences. ProPak-A-based producer cells are efficient, yielding higher stable titers than PA317-based producers. In addition, a vector that consistently gave rise to RCR in PA317 cells never resulted in detectable RCR in ProPak-A-based producer cultures. We have also shown that ProPak-A-packaged particles are not inactivated by human serum. Thus, the packaging cells we describe are as efficient and safer than the amphotropic packaging cells most commonly used in clinical gene therapy work and are also more appropriate for in vivo gene delivery.","['Rigg, R J', 'Chen, J', 'Dando, J S', 'Forestell, S P', 'Plavec, I', 'Bohnlein, E']","['Rigg RJ', 'Chen J', 'Dando JS', 'Forestell SP', 'Plavec I', 'Bohnlein E']","['SyStemix, 3155 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, California, 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90194-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0194 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Apr 1;218(1):290-5. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0194.,,,,"['TGT06S01/Telethon/Italy', 'TGT95000/Telethon/Italy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the HTLV-II envelope (Env) gp61-II were used to infect human cells, and syncytium formation was observed, demonstrating that HTLV-II Env expression was sufficient to mediate syncytium formation in appropriate cells. This syncytium formation could be blocked by sera from HTLV-II-infected individuals. Infection with these recombinant vaccinia viruses caused fusion in mouse/human hybrid cells containing only human chromosome 17, whereas there was no obvious syncytium formation in mouse cells. This fusogenic phenotype of recombinant gp61-II is likely a property of the specific interaction between HTLV-II envelope protein and the HTLV cellular receptor, encoded by a gene that was previously indicated to be on human chromosome 17. On this basis, we developed a sensitive syncytium formation assay, using lacZ gene activation, for detecting the presence of the HTLV receptor(s).

The fusion protein PML-RAR which is not localized in nuclear bodies, also enhanced the transactivating activity of PR, but this effect was totally suppressed by the administration of retinoic acid. PML, which is ubiquitously expressed, may thus be involved in the transactivation properties of steroid hormone receptors. This mechanism may also play a role in the oncogenic properties of PML-RAR and in their suppression by retinoic acid.","['Guiochon-Mantel, A', 'Savouret, J F', 'Quignon, F', 'Delabre, K', 'Milgrom, E', 'De The, H']","['Guiochon-Mantel A', 'Savouret JF', 'Quignon F', 'Delabre K', 'Milgrom E', 'De The H']",['INSERM U-135 Hormones et Reproduction Hopital Bicetre.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.9.12.8614415 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1995 Dec;9(12):1791-803. doi: 10.1210/mend.9.12.8614415.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro and in vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetic parameters of leukemic blast cells were initiated in order to contribute to the pharmacological basis of optimal ara-C treatment strategies. Peripheral or bone marrow blast cells from 66 leukemic patients [51 acute myelogenous leukemia (ALL), 15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML) were separated and incubated with ara-C for 1 hour and in ara-C-free medium for another 3 hours, and the intracellular formation and retention of ara-CTP was measured. In eight children who received continuous ara-C infusion for induction treatment, the ara-CTP concentration in circulating blast cells was monitored in vivo. The in vitro values observed in this assay corresponded to the cellular levels monitored in vivo. The ara-CTP retention differed clearly among the individual groups, as classified by immunophenotype at the time of the initial diagnosis: non-T-ALL 67+/-25% (x+/-SD, n=33), T-ALL 37+/-15% (n=8), and AML 34+/-18% (n=14). The difference in ara-CTP retention between non-T-All and AML (P<0.05) as well as T-ALL (P<0.05) was significant. There was a tendency toward lower ara-CTP retention in relapsed as compared with newly diagnosed ALL, but the difference was not significant. The maximal accumulation of ara-CTP (after 1 hour incubation) was comparable in AML, T-ALL, non-T-ALL, and blast cells from children in relapse. The observed similarity of cellular accumulation in all groups and the significantly more rapid decrease in T-ALL and AML provide the pharmacokinetic rationale supporting the prolonged infusion duration for ara-C in these subgroups as an alternative to the intensification by high-dose ara-C schedules with short-term infusion.","['Boos, J', 'Hohenlochter, B', 'Schulze-Westhoff, P', 'Schiller, M', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Jurgens, H']","['Boos J', 'Hohenlochter B', 'Schulze-Westhoff P', 'Schiller M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Jurgens H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Culture Media)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199606)26:6<397::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199606)26:6<397::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-C [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Jun;26(6):397-404. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199606)26:6<397::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutagenic property of cytotoxic therapy as well as defective immunity have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of SMN in patients previously treated for HD. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl with HD who developed two different second malignancies within a latent period of 28 months following HD diagnosis. The patient presented initially with bilateral cervical and supraclavicular as well as mediastinal and paraaortic lymphadenopathy. She was staged as IIIA, nodular sclerosing type HD, and was given eight alternative cycles of MOPP-ABVD followed by ""mantle"" field radiotherapy to a total dose of 3.3 Gy plus 0.4 Gy to the upper mediastinum. Within 8 months following the completion of therapy, a period of myelodysplasia and progressive severe immune deficiency, considered as a result of initial treatment, occurred. Eighteen months after HD diagnosis while the patient was continuously neutropenic and heavily immunocompromised, a peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion type (AIL) Grade III, appeared in both lungs within and beyond the radiation field, with no evidence of HD in biopsy specimens. After institution of a new chemotherapy regimen (L17M), a satisfactory response regarding NHL lesions was noted. However, 10 months later the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) accompanied by complex chromosomal abnormalities evoluted to frank ANLL with a rapid fatal course. This case supports the hypothesis that combined modality treatment accompanied by severe immunodeficiency may result in the development of multiple second malignancies even within a very short latent period, especially in a subgroup of HD patients who may be particularly increased risk of second cancers.","['Polychronopoulou, S', 'Panagiotou, J P', 'Papadakis, T', 'Mavrou, A', 'Anagnostou, D', 'Haidas, S']","['Polychronopoulou S', 'Panagiotou JP', 'Papadakis T', 'Mavrou A', 'Anagnostou D', 'Haidas S']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*etiology/immunology/pathology']",1996/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199605)26:5<359::AID-MPO9>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199605)26:5<359::AID-MPO9>3.0.CO;2-H [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 May;26(5):359-66. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199605)26:5<359::AID-MPO9>3.0.CO;2-H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was computed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The results showed that the survival of AML was poor, with a 2-year DFS of only 30%. The major cause of death for AML was leukemia and leukemia-related complications, such as hemorrhage and severe infections. In contrast, a 62% 2-year DFS was achieved for ALL. It was found that marked hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and/or spleen > or = 10 cm below the costal margin) at presentation correlated with a significance shortened survival in our patients with ALL.

The ability of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein, gp 120, to cause similar inhibition has implicated this inhibitory signal in the induction of T-cell anergy and apoptosis observed in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In order to clarify the biochemical basis of this inhibition, we analyzed the effect of CD4 ligation on early signaling events induced by subsequent CD3xCD4 co-crosslinking. By comparison with CD3 crosslinking alone, CD3xCD4 co-crosslinking of a CD3+CD4+ human T-cell leukemia line (SupT1) resulted in an enhanced increase in free intracellular calcium concentration and tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, including the prominent phosphorylation of an unidentified 120-kDa protein (p120). Prior CD4 ligation inhibited these responses. Similar results were obtained with A3.01, another CD3+CD4+ T leukemic line. However, P120 was only minor phosphorylated on tyrosine upon receptor crosslinking in A2.01/CD4(-cyt401), a derivative line expressing a truncated CD4 coreceptor lacking its cytoplasmic domain which binds the p56lck protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). Furthermore, prior CD4 ligation failed to inhibit in this line the increased tyrosine phosphorylation induced by subsequent CD3xCD4 co-crosslinking. Thus, prior CD4 crosslinking, or expression of truncated CD4, are both associated with reduced p120 phosphorylation. These results suggest that p120 is a p56lck substrate playing an important role during T-cell activation.","['Baier-Bitterlich, G', 'Baier, G', 'Gulbins, E', 'Coggeshall, K M', 'Altman, A']","['Baier-Bitterlich G', 'Baier G', 'Gulbins E', 'Coggeshall KM', 'Altman A']","['Division of Cell Biology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",1995/03/03 00:00,1995/03/03 00:01,['1995/03/03 00:00'],"['1995/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0024320595000747 [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(95)00074-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1995 Mar 3;56(15):1287-97. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(95)00074-7.,,,,"['AI28197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the monocytic cell line THP-1, PMA treatment resulted in a more differentiated phenotype than VD3, according to adherence, loss of proliferation, phagocytosis of latex beads, and expression of CD11b and CD14. Both differentiating substances induced similar effects in the release of superoxide anions (O2-). VD3-differentiated cells did not release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), in contrast to PMA-differentiated cells, and in PMA-differentiated cells phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and expression was increase. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release was higher in PMA-treated cells. PMA- but not VD3-differentiation resulted in a translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes to membrane fractions. Both differentiating agents up-regulated the expression of PKC isoenzymes. Whereas VD3 elevated mainly the expression of PKC-beta, PMA caused a strong increase in PKC-delta and a weak increase in PKC-alpha, PKC-epsilon, and PKC-zeta expression. These results indicate that phorbol ester and the active metabolite of vitamin D induce different signal pathways, which might result in different achievement of differentiation.","['Schwende, H', 'Fitzke, E', 'Ambs, P', 'Dieter, P']","['Schwende H', 'Fitzke E', 'Ambs P', 'Dieter P']","['Biochemisches Institut, Klinik fur Tumorbiologie, Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Apr;59(4):555-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using anti-cytokine antibodies we demonstrated that IL-T is identical to the simultaneously described IL-15. The observation of a discordance between IL-15 message expression and IL-15 synthesis led us to examine normal and aberrant IL-15 mRNA for post-transcriptional controls that inhibit protein production at the level of RNA translation. When compared to activated monocytes, IL-15 mRNA expression was 6- to 10-fold greater in HuT-102 T cells. The predominant IL-15 message from HuT-102 is a chimeric mRNA joining a segment of the R region of the long terminal repeat of HTLV-I and the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of IL-15. R segment introduction eliminated over 200 nucleotides of IL-15 5' UTR including 8 of 10 upstream AUGs that are present in the normal IL-15 message. On analysis of the 5' UTR of normal IL-15, we demonstrated that these 10 upstream AUGs interfere with IL-15 mRNA translation. Thus, IL-15 synthesis by the ATL cell line HuT-102 involves an increase in IL-15 mRNA transcription and translation secondary to the production of an HTLV-I-R fusion message that lacks many upstream AUGs.","['Bamford, R N', 'Battiata, A P', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Bamford RN', 'Battiata AP', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Il15ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/physiology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.59.4.476 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Apr;59(4):476-80. doi: 10.1002/jlb.59.4.476.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both SL/Kh and SL/Ni mouse strains show a high level of expression of ETV from early in life, the former is a pre-B lymphoma-prone strain and the latter is rather lymphoma-resistant.

The incidence of overall lymphomas and that of acute pre-B lymphomas was lower in (SL/NixSL/Kh)F1 than in (SL/KhxSL/Ni)F1, although the difference was not statistically significant. These observations indicate that an epigenetic maternal resistance mechanism of SL/Ni mice plays a role in the lymphoma resistance. Furthermore, in the backcross combinations without maternal influence of SL/Ni, we observed a genetic mechanism of lymphoma resistance: an SL/Ni-derived recessive lymphoma-resistance gene mapped in the proximal segment of Chr. 4.

We reported previously that after leukemogenic irradiation, preneoplastic cells developed, albeit infrequently, from thymic leukemia antigen-2+ (TL-2+) thymocytes. Limited numbers of TL-2+ cells from individual irradiated B10.Thy 1.1 mice were injected into B10.Thy 1.2 mice intrathymically, and the common genetic changes among the donor-type T cell lymphomas were investigated with regard to p53 gene and chromosome aberrations. The results indicated that some mutations in the p53 gene had taken place in these lymphomas, but there was no common mutation among the donor-type lymphomas from individual irradiated mice, suggesting that these mutations were late-occurring events in the process of oncogenesis. On the other hand, there were common chromosome aberrations or translocations such as trisomy 15, t(7F;10C), t(1A;13D) or t(6A;XB) among the donor-type lymphomas derived from half of the individual irradiated mice. This indicated that the aberrations/translocations, which occurred in single progenitor cells at the early T cell differentiation either just before or after gamma T cell receptor rearrangements, might be important candidates for initiating events. In the donor-type lymphomas from the other half of the individual irradiated mice, microgenetic changes were suggested to be initial events and also might take place in single progenitor cells just before or right after gamma TCR rearrangements.","['Muto, M', 'Chen, Y', 'Kubo, E', 'Mita, K']","['Muto M', 'Chen Y', 'Kubo E', 'Mita K']","['Division of Biology and Oncology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*radiation effects', 'Genes, p53/radiation effects', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precancerous Conditions/etiology/genetics', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*radiation effects', 'Thy-1 Antigens/genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096810210 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00213.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Mar;87(3):247-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00213.x.,,,,,PMC5921089,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three Tax-producing human T-cell lines carrying the HTLV-I genome expressed OX40 on their surfaces. Furthermore, Tax-induced transcriptional activation of OX40 was shown in Tax-inducible JPX-9 cells. These results demonstrate that both OX40 and its ligand (gp34) are constitutively expressed on the surfaces of Tax-expressing T lymphocytes, suggesting that the OX40L/OX40 system contributes to growth stimulation of the virus-infected T cells.","['Higashimura, N', 'Takasawa, N', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Nakamura, M', 'Sugamura, K']","['Higashimura N', 'Takasawa N', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Sugamura K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cadmium Chloride', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'OX40 Ligand', 'Receptors, OX40', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096810180 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00210.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Mar;87(3):227-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00210.x.,,,,,PMC5921092,,,,,,,,,,,,

A principal interest from the beginning was the genetics of cancer, well before this subject became widely popular. This interest arose in part because of marked binational differences in type-specific cancer rates, such as the very low rates among Japanese for Hodgkin's disease in the young, testicular cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, superficial spreading melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Wilms' tumor (half the U.S. frequency). Three seminars were devoted to the seeming reciprocal relationship between B-cell lymphoma (low in Japan) and certain autoimmune diseases (high in Japan), which is perhaps similar in origin to the male/female differences in the rates for these diseases. A seminar on Li-Fraumeni syndrome led to the recognition of cases among Japanese pedigrees brought to the meeting, and generated a study of its occurrence in Japanese families with adrenocortical carcinoma in a child. Another seminar revealed a marked clustering of rare cancers in Werner's (premature aging) syndrome in Japan, and led to a binational study and analysis of case-reports worldwide. Three seminars on pathology heightened appreciation of the importance of subclassifying cancer by subsite and subtype for racial and other comparisons. Four seminars on biostatistics in cancer research generated a substantial exchange of specialists and trainees in this field.","['Miller, R W']",['Miller RW'],"['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', '*Congresses as Topic/history', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Fish Diseases/etiology', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation/history', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/history/*organization & administration', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology/veterinary', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'United States/epidemiology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096810179 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00209.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Mar;87(3):221-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00209.x.,,,20,,PMC5921091,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of growth factors, however, only the colony formation by CML-BC cells was inhibited by CPT, leaving NBMC and CML-CP cells intact or much less affected. Analysis of the cellular DNA content revealed that CPT induced specific changes in cell cycle distribution: decrease in S and G2/M fraction with simultaneous accumulation of the cells in G1 phase and the appearance of ""sub-diploid"" (apoptotic) peak. To determine if CPT is able to exert selective antileukemic effect, 1:1 mixture of NBMC and CML-BC cells was exposed to CPT in the absence of growth factors and assayed for growth ability in clonogenic assay and for expression of BCR/ABL transcript in single colonies. BCR/ABL transcript was not detected in colonies incubated with CTP, in contrast, most of colonies arising from untreated cells possessed leukemic origin (BCR/ABL expression).

The resistance can he either inherent or acquired by an exposure to a chemotherapeutic drug. The available models for study of these phenomena have not led to major improvements in the therapy for human cancers. Therefore, in order to develop a new model for such studies, we have exposed human myeloid leukemia cells HL60 to increasing concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and characterized the emerging new phenotypes of these cells over a period of 4 years. During the stepwise development of resistance only cells which did not adhere to the flask walls were passaged. Beginning at 30 nM 1,25D3 the sublines became resistant to the differentiation-inducing and growth-retarding properties of 1,25D3 even at 400 nM. Also, their growth rates in 1,25D3-free media increased. In addition, beginning at 40 nM 1,25D3 the sublines acquired resistance to 5-beta-D-arabinocytosine (araC) due to the lack of expression of the deoxycytidine kinase gene. The araC-resistant sublines were also near-tetraploid, as judged by their DNA content. When grown in 1,25D3-free long-term culture the phenotype was essentially stable. The development of cross-resistance to araC during growth in the presence of an unrelated compound (i.e., 1,25D3) shows that in some instances an apparently inherent drug resistance may in fact he due to a metabolic defect resulting from an exposure to another agent.","['Wajchmann, H J', 'Rathod, B', 'Song, S', 'Xu, H', 'Wang, X', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wajchmann HJ', 'Rathod B', 'Song S', 'Xu H', 'Wang X', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Ploidies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S001448279690141X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0141 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 May 1;224(2):312-22. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0141.,,,,['R01-CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects may be due to its interaction with cellular proteins, consisting of several transcription factors including CREB, NF-kappa B and SRF, and the transcriptional inhibitor, I kappa B. Here, we found that Tax binds to a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4A, which has ankyrin motifs similar to I kappa B. p16INK4A binds to the cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, and inhibits their activity, resulting in suppression of G1 phase progression. The binding of Tax to p16INK4a induced a reduction in the p16INK4A-CDK4 complex, with subsequent activation of CDK4 kinase. Tax also suppressed p16INK4A-mediated inhibition of U2OS cell growth. The p16INK4A gene was frequently deleted in many T-cell lines, but not in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Taking these findings together, the functional inactivation of p16INK4A by Tax through protein-protein interaction is suggested to contribute to cellular immortalization and transformation induced by HTLV-1 infection.","['Suzuki, T', 'Kitao, S', 'Matsushime, H', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Kitao S', 'Matsushime H', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Apr 1;15(7):1607-14.,,,,,PMC450070,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF and CNTF significantly enhanced the survival of the Sertoli cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect of LIF on the Sertoli cells was significant at a concentration of 1 ng/ml after 3 or 6 days of culture, whereas CNTF had a significant effect at 10 ng/ml. Neither LIF nor CNTF had an effect on Sertoli cell proliferation. The survival of proliferating gonocytes (isolated from 3-day-old rats testes) was also significantly higher in cultures to which LIF (7.5 ng/ml) or CNTF (10 ng/ml) was added. No effect of these cytokines was found on the mitotic activity of proliferating gonocytes. However, LIF (7.5 ng/ml) stimulated the proliferation of quiescent gonocytes (isolated from day 1 testes) after 3 days of culture. Combinations of LIF (or CNTF) with fibroblast growth factor 2 (10 ng/ml) and steel factor (50 ng/ml) did not further improve the long term culture of the gonocytes. LIf- and CNTF-like proteins of the expected molecular masses (32,000 and 22,000 daltons, respectively, under reducing conditions) were found by Western blotting in testicular extracts of 3-day-old rats. Taken together, these results indicate that LIF or CNTF may play a role at the start of the spermatogenesis. The characterization of receptors for LIF or CNTF on the gonocytes and/or neonatal Sertoli cells will aid in a better understanding of the physiological role of these cytokines in the reproductive system.","['De Miguel, M P', 'De Boer-Brouwer, M', 'Paniagua, R', 'van den Hurk, R', 'De Rooij, D G', 'Van Dissel-Emiliani, F M']","['De Miguel MP', 'De Boer-Brouwer M', 'Paniagua R', 'van den Hurk R', 'De Rooij DG', 'Van Dissel-Emiliani FM']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Cell Biology, Veterinary School, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sertoli Cells/*physiology', 'Spermatozoa/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Testis/chemistry/cytology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.137.5.8612528 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1996 May;137(5):1885-93. doi: 10.1210/endo.137.5.8612528.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the design program was to identify TS inhibitors with different pharmacological characteristics from classical folate analogs and, most notably, to develop non-glutamate-containing molecules which would not require facilitated transport for uptake and would not undergo intracellular polyglutamylation. One molecule which resulted from this program, AG337, inhibits purified recombinant human TS with a Ki of 11 nM, and displays non-competitive inhibition kinetics. It was further shown to inhibit cell growth in a panel of cell lines of murine and human origin, displaying an IC50 of between 0.39 microM 6.6 microM. TS was suggested as the locus of action of AG337 by the ability of thymidine to antagonize cell growth inhibition and the direct demonstration of TS inhibition in whole cells using a tritium release assay. The demonstration, by flow cytometry, that AG337-treated L1210 cells were arrested in the S phase of the cell cycle was also consistent with a blockage of TS, as was the pattern of ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide pool modulation in AG337-treated cells, which showed significant reduction in TTP levels. The effects of AG337 were quickly reversed on removal of the drug, suggesting, as would be expected for a lipophilic agent, that there is rapid influx and efflux from cells and no intracellular metabolism to derivatives with enhanced retention. In vivo, AG337 was highly active against the thymidine kinase-deficient murine L5178Y/TK-lymphoma implanted either i.p. or i.m. following i.p. or oral delivery. Prolonged dosing periods of 5 or 10 days were required for activity, and efficacy was improved with twice-daily dose administration. Dose levels of 25 mg/kg delivered i.p. twice daily for 10 days, 50 mg/kg once daily for 10 days, or 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 days elicited 100% cures against the i.p. tumor. Doses required for activity against the i.m. tumor were higher (100 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 5 or 10 days) but demonstrated the ability of AG337 to penetrate solid tissue barriers. Oral delivery required doses of > or = 150 mg/kg twice daily for periods of 5-10 days to produce 100% cure rates against both i.m. and i.p. implanted tumors. These results were consistent with the pharmacokinetics parameters determined in rats, for which oral bioavailability of 30-50% was determined, together with a relatively short elimination half life of 2h. Clinical studies with AG337 are currently in progress.","['Webber, S', 'Bartlett, C A', 'Boritzki, T J', 'Hillard, J A', 'Howland, E F', 'Johnston, A L', 'Kosa, M', 'Margosiak, S A', 'Morse, C A', 'Shetty, B V']","['Webber S', 'Bartlett CA', 'Boritzki TJ', 'Hillard JA', 'Howland EF', 'Johnston AL', 'Kosa M', 'Margosiak SA', 'Morse CA', 'Shetty BV']","['Pharmacology Department, Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, San Diego, CA USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'K75ZUN743Q (nolatrexed)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Solubility', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050422 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;37(6):509-17. doi: 10.1007/s002800050422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons for this selective oligodendrocyte death and demyelination are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In light of the T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrates in MS lesions and the numerous cytokines these cells secrete, the direct influence of cytokines on survival of cultured oligodendrocytes and sensory neurons was investigated. Expression of cytokines in vivo was determined by immunolabeling cryostat sections of snap-frozen tissue containing chronic active lesions from four different patients. The samples were also analyzed for the presence of apoptotic nuclei by in situ labeling of 3'-OH ends of degraded nuclear DNA. RESULTS: The results showed: (i) interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) to be a potent inducer of apoptosis among oligodendrocytes in vitro and that this effect can be reversed by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); (ii) IFN gamma has a minimal effect on the survival of cultured neurons; (iii) IFN gamma at the margins of active MS plaques but not in unaffected white matter; (iv) evidence for apoptosis of oligodendrocytes at the advancing margins of chronic active MS plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Injury to a substantial number of oligodendrocytes in MS is the results of programmed cell death rather than necrotic cell death mechanisms. We postulate that IFN gamma plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS by activating apoptosis in oligodendrocytes.","['Vartanian, T', 'Li, Y', 'Zhao, M', 'Stefansson, K']","['Vartanian T', 'Li Y', 'Zhao M', 'Stefansson K']","['Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Microglia/physiology', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*etiology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*drug effects/pathology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Med. 1995 Nov;1(7):732-43.,,,,,PMC2230017,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a limiting dilution assay of mafosfamide-resistant progenitors (pre-colony-forming units [CFU]), which are ancestral to committed progenitors such as CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (GM) to analyze the kinetics of myeloid engraftment after BMT and to assess the size of the stem cell pool at intervals up to 66 months thereafter. In 24 patients transplanted for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (eight with matched unrelated donors and 16 with sibling donors), the rate of neutrophil engraftment correlated strongly with the number of pre-CFU transfused per kilogram recipient body weight (r = .7, P < .005) but not with CFU-GM per kilogram or nucleated cells per kilogram. In 25 patients studied 6 to 66 months after allogeneic BMT, the mean number of pre-CFU in the marrow was 3.1/10(5) mononuclear cells (MNC) (median, 3.47; range, 0.4 to 23.3), compared with 24.7/10(5) MNC (median, 27.3; range, 4.2 to 180) in 25 normal subjects. CFU-GM were also reduced in these patients, but with considerable overlap into the normal range (mean +/- SD: 54 +/- 45.6 per 10(5) MNC; normal, 129 +/- 61.6). Low pre-CFU but not low CFU-GM levels were associated with reduced peripheral blood white blood cell counts in post-BMT patients. Pre-CFU and CFU-GM levels were not related to the interval posttransplant and remained low for up to 66 months. We conclude that the pre-CFU assay measures a population of stem/progenitor cells that are important in the kinetics of engraftment after allogeneic BMT. Our data suggest that pre-CFU levels may remain low for some years after BMT in humans.","['Kirkland, M A', 'Spencer, A', 'Davidson, R J', 'McDonald, C', 'Goldman, J M']","['Kirkland MA', 'Spencer A', 'Davidson RJ', 'McDonald C', 'Goldman JM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund (LRF) Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Graft Rejection/*pathology', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63776-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3963-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is critical for the formation of the spectrin/actin/protein 4.1 junctional complex, the integrity of which is important for the horizontal strength and elasticity of RBCs. We and others have previously shown that multiple protein 4.1 mRNA isoforms are generated from a single genomic locus by several alternative mRNA splicing events, leading to the insertion or skipping of discrete internal sequence motifs. The physiologic significance of these motifs: (1) an upstream 17-nucleotide sequence located at the 5' end of exon 2 that contains an in-frame ATG initiation codon, the inclusion of which by use of an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 2 allows the production of a 135-kD high-molecular-weight isoform present in nonerythroid cells; (2) exon 16, which encodes a 21-amino acid (21aa) segment located in the 10-kD ""spectrin/actin binding domain"" (SAB), the presence of which is required for junctional complex stability in RBCs. Previous studies by our group and others suggested that, among blood cells, this exon was retained only in mature mRNA in the erythroid lineage. Exon 16 is one of a series of three closely linked alternatively spliced exons, generating eight possible mRNA products with unique configurations of the SAB. In this communication, we report studies of the expression of both the translation initiation region and the SAB region during induced erythroid maturation in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We have found that only two of eight possible combinatorial patterns of exon splicing at the SAB region are encountered: the isoform lacking all three exons, present in predifferentiated cells, and the isoform containing only exon 16, which increases in amount during erythroid differentiation. The protein isoform containing the 21aa segment encoded by exon 16 efficiently and exclusively incorporates into the membrane, whereas the isoform lacking this 21aa segment remains in the cytoplasm, as well as the membrane. In contrast with exon 16, the erythroid pattern of exon 2 splicing, i.e., skipping of the 17-base sequence at the 5' end, was found to be already established in the uninduced MEL cells, suggesting strongly that this regulated splicing event occurs at an earlier stage of differentiation. Our results demonstrate asynchronous regulation of two key mRNA splicing events during erythroid cell maturation. These findings also show that the splicing of exon 16 alters the intracellular localization of protein 4.1 in MEL cells, and appears to be essential for its targeting to the plasmalemma.","['Baklouti, F', 'Huang, S C', 'Tang, T K', 'Delaunay, J', 'Marchesi, V T', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Baklouti F', 'Huang SC', 'Tang TK', 'Delaunay J', 'Marchesi VT', 'Benz EJ Jr']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 1)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neuropeptides', 'RNA Precursors/*biosynthesis']",1996/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63771-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3934-41.,,,,"['HL 24385/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 44985/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effect of replacing this policy with one calling for marrows only when blood count is abnormal (platelets < 100,000, neutrophils < 1,000, circulating blasts > 0%, unrelated to prior chemotherapy), we reviewed the records of all 444 patients with AML whose disease recurred ( > or = 5% marrow blasts unrelated to prior chemotherapy) for the first time between 1980 and 1995. The 375 patients with adequate follow-up were classified as (1) simultaneous--blood count abnormal when relapse noted without a normal marrow intervening between first abnormal count and relapse, 289 patients (77% of 375), (2) marrow first--blood count normal when relapse noted, 60 patients (16%), or (3) blood first--a normal marrow intervened between first abnormal blood count and relapse, 26 patients (7%). Interval between marrow exams and blood counts did not differ in the three groups (a 25-patient sample of the 289 patient simultaneous group was analyzed as representative of this group) with marrows done at a median of once monthly and blood counts at a median of once weekly from complete remission (CR) date to relapse date. The three groups also had similar first CR duration, and pretreatment cytogenetics.

We have previously shown that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) restores beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion of CML progenitors to stroma. Because beta1 integrins transmit proliferation inhibitory signals from the microenvironment to normal hematopoietic progenitors, we hypothesized that decreased integrin-mediated adhesion of CML progenitors contributes to their continuous proliferation when in contact with stroma and that IFN-alpha treatment, by restoring integrin-mediated adhesion, also restores integrin-mediated microenvironmental inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation. We show here that, in contrast to normal colony-forming cells (CFC), the percentage of malignant CML CFC in S-phase was not significantly reduced following coculture with stromal layers. However, IFN-alpha treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the proliferation of CML CFC on coculture with stroma. This effect was not because of a direct antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha on CML CFC because the proliferation of IFN-alpha treated CML CFC kept in suspension culture was not reduced. We examined the role of restored signaling through beta 1 integrin receptors in IFN-alpha induced inhibition of CML progenitors in two sets of experiment. In the first set of experiments, we demonstrated that proliferation of IFN-alpha-treated CML CFC, but not untreated CML CFC, was significantly reduced following coculture with 33/66-kD and 75-kD FN fragments, recognized by alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins respectively. In a second set of experiments, we demonstrate that direct stimulation of integrin receptors by crosslinking with blocking antibodies to alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrins and secondary goat antimouse antibodies resulted in significant reduction in proliferation of normal and IFN-alpha treated CML progenitors but not untreated CML CFC. These studies indicate that CML hematopoietic progenitors are unresponsive to beta 1-integrin mediated proliferation inhibition and that IFN-alpha not only restores beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion but also beta1-mediated microenvironmental inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation. These observations may explain, at least in part, the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha in CML.","['Bhatia, R', 'McCarthy, J B', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Bhatia R', 'McCarthy JB', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63764-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3883-91.,,,,"['R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-4993001/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HO-5403901/HO/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the pathogenesis of the AIHA in CLL, we analyzed the lg heavy (H) chain variable region genes expressed by leukemic cells from CLL patients with and without AIHA. Two VH genes were preferentially expressed by the leukemic cells in the CLL cases with AIHA and were present in 9 of the 12 investigated cases. The 51p1/DP-10 gene was expressed in 5 of these cases and was absent in the control group of 12 consecutive CLL cases without AIHA, whereas the DP-50 gene was present in 4 CLL-AIHA cases and only once in the control CLL group. A strikingly similar H-chain CDR3 region that contained a single reading frame of the DXP4 DH gene segment, and N-encoded proline at the DH/JH boundary, and a tyrosine-rich region encoded by the JH6 gene segment was observed in four CLL-AIHA cases. The preferential expression of two VH gene segments and a particular CDR3 region by the leukemic cells of patients with AIHA suggests that the antibodies produced by the CLL cells are directly involved in the pathogenesis of the hemolytic anemia.","['Efremov, D G', 'Ivanovski, M', 'Siljanovski, N', 'Pozzato, G', 'Cevreska, L', 'Fais, F', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Batista, F D', 'Burrone, O R']","['Efremov DG', 'Ivanovski M', 'Siljanovski N', 'Pozzato G', 'Cevreska L', 'Fais F', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Batista FD', 'Burrone OR']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Rearrangement/*immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63762-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3869-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further address the role of IL-9 in the development of acute leukemia, we evaluated the proliferative response of three leukemic cell lines and 32 primary samples from acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients to recombinant human (rh)-IL-9 alone and combined with rh-IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and stem cell factor ([SCF] c-kit ligand). The colony-forming ability of HL60, K562, and KG1 cells and fresh AML cell populations upon IL-9 stimulation was assessed by a clonogenic assay in methylcellulose, whereas the cell-cycle characteristics of leukemic samples were determined by the acridine-orange flow cytometric technique and the bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation assay. In addition, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay (TDTA) and standard analysis of DNA cleavage by gel electrophoresis were used to evaluate induction of prevention of apoptosis by IL-9. Il-9, as a single cytokine, at various concentrations stimulated the colony formation of the three myeloid cell lines under serum-containing and serum-free conditions, and this effect was completely abrogated by anti-IL-9 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). When tested on fresh AML samples, optimal concentrations of IL-9 resulted in an increase of blast colony formation in all the cases studied (mean +/- SEM: 19 +/- 10 colony-forming unit-leukemic [CFU-L]/10(5) cells plated in control cultures v 107 +/- 32 in IL-9-supplemented dishes, P < .02).

The proliferative activity of IL-9 was also observed when T-cell-depleted AML specimens were incubated with increasing concentrations of the cytokine. Addition of SCF to IL-9 had an additive or synergistic effect of the two cytokines in five of eight AML cases tested for CFU-L growth (187 +/- 79 colonies v 107 +/- 32 CFU-L, P = .05). Positive interaction was also observed when IL-9 was combined with IL-3 and GM-CSF. Studies of cell-cycle distribution of AML samples demonstrated that IL-9 alone significantly augmented the number of leukemic cells in S-phase in the majority of cases evaluated. IL-9 and SCF in combination resulted in a remarkable decrease of the G0 cell fraction (38.2% +/- 24% v 58.6% +/- 22% of control cultures, P < .05) and induced an increase of G1- and S-phase cells. Conversely, neither IL-9 alone nor the combination of IL-9 and SCF had any effect on induction or prevention of apoptosis of leukemic cells. In summary, our results indicate that IL-9 may play a role in the development of AML by stimulating leukemic cells to enter the S-phase rather than preventing cell death. Moreover, IL-9 acts synergistically with SCF for recruiting quiescent leukemic cells in cell cycle.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Fortuna, A', 'Tafuri, A', 'Fogli, M', 'Amabile, M', 'Grande, A', 'Ricciardi, M R', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Bonsi, L', 'Bagnara, G', 'Visani, G', 'Martinelli, G', 'Ferrari, S', 'Tura, S']","['Lemoli RM', 'Fortuna A', 'Tafuri A', 'Fogli M', 'Amabile M', 'Grande A', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Petrucci MT', 'Bonsi L', 'Bagnara G', 'Visani G', 'Martinelli G', 'Ferrari S', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-9)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-9/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63760-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3852-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells towards neutrophils or monocytes has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death, which is inhibited by bcl-2 over-expression. However, the role of the bcl-2 gene family during erythroid differentiation of human leukemia cells remains unknown. We found that human erythroleukemia (HEL) and K562, two leukemia cell lines that undergo erythroid differentiation do not express Bcl-2, but express Bcl-XL, a related protein that functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis. Differentiation of HEL or K562 cells with inducers of erythroid differentiation (hemin, retinoic acid, or transforming growth factor-beta) was accompanied by progressive cell death and degradation of genomic DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments. The loss of cellular viability was associated with downregulation of bcl-xL mRNA and protein. In contrast, the levels of Bax, another Bcl-2 family member implicated in apoptosis remained unaltered. Constitutive expression of Bcl-XL by gene transfer inhibited apoptosis triggered by erythroid differentiation of HEL K562 cells. Yet, Bcl-XL did not alter the expression of epsilon-globin, which is induced during erythoid differentiation of HEL and K562 cells, arguing that apoptosis and differentiation can be uncoupled by Bcl-XL. These results indicate that Bcl-XL acts as an antiapoptosis protein in leukemia cells that undergo erythroid differentiation and that downregulation of bcl-x is a component of the apoptotic response that is coupled to differentiation in human leukemia cells.","['Benito, A', 'Silva, M', 'Grillot, D', 'Nunez, G', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Benito A', 'Silva M', 'Grillot D', 'Nunez G', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63758-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3837-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a novel method to detect intracellular messenger RNA (mRNA) by combining the techniques of reverse transcription (RT) and PCR performed directly inside the cells, without extraction of the nucleic acid. We applied this method, which we call ""in-cell RT-PCR"", to detect hybrid BCR/ABL transcript within single cells. After cellular permeabilization and fixation of single cells in suspension, the neoplastic mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, and the cDNA was amplified by PCR with fluorescent primers, specific for bcr/abl. Flow cytometry was used to detect cells positive for the amplified DNA within the cell cytoplasm. After transferring the amplified cells onto slides by cytospin, the positive cells for BCR/ABL cDNA were observed by fluorescent microscopy. The technique was capable of detecting low abundancy signals and distinguishing different levels of gene expression. The amplification products were found in the cells and supernatants. The distribution was critically affected by the protease digestion condition. The specificity of amplification was confirmed by a nested RT-PCR of BCR/ABL performed on extracted mRNA from the same sample, and by reamplification of supernatants. We have used the technique to study 10 Ph+ CML patients and three normal subjects as controls. Four patients were 100% Ph+ at diagnosis time and RT-PCR+ at cytogenetic and molecular analysis, respectively. In-cell RT-PCR showed that the residual non-neoplastic cells could be observed in all cases. In two patients undergoing interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy and in four bone-marrow transplanted patients, the in-cell RT-PCR was used to compare the level of Ph+ positivity detected by cytogenetic analysis with the number of cells expressing BCR/ABL transcript. In this manner, we could estimate the MRD. Our preliminary application of the technique suggests that it is capable of accurately identifying cells transcribing bcr/abl, and that it may have significant clinical applications in the detection of MRD.","['Testoni, N', 'Martinelli, G', 'Farabegoli, P', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Amabile, M', 'Raspadori, D', 'Pelliconi, S', 'Zuffa, E', 'Carboni, C', 'Tura, S']","['Testoni N', 'Martinelli G', 'Farabegoli P', 'Zaccaria A', 'Amabile M', 'Raspadori D', 'Pelliconi S', 'Zuffa E', 'Carboni C', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Haematology, L. e A.

Using a flow cytometry-based assay and confocal imaging, we show that these constructs mediated significant phagocytosis of B lymphocytes by macrophages that could be enhanced with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and IFN gamma in combination with macrophage colony-stimulating factor. BsAb-dependent phagocytosis was triggered through Fc gamma RI and could be blocked only by using F(ab')2 fragments from the parent molecule or by cross-linking Fc gamma RI. BsAb-dependent phagocytosis was not blocked by antibodies to the other Fc receptors, Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. Because these antibody constructs bind to an epitope outside the Fc gamma RI ligand binding site, we show that autologous serum, polyclonal IgG, and monomeric IgG1 did not block BsAb-dependent phagocytosis, whereas autologous serum and the IgG fractions blocked parent molecule monoclonal antibody-dependent phagocytosis due to the avid binding of monomeric IgG to Fc gamma RI. Finally, BsAb-mediated phagocytosis was effective against the malignant B cells of patients with mantle cell lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Based on these studies, we propose that BsAbs may provide an effective means of immunomodulation for patients with B-cell malignancies.","['Ely, P', 'Wallace, P K', 'Givan, A L', 'Graziano, R F', 'Guyre, P M', 'Fanger, M W']","['Ely P', 'Wallace PK', 'Givan AL', 'Graziano RF', 'Guyre PM', 'Fanger MW']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Macrophages/immunology/*pathology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63755-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3813-21.,,,,"['AI-19053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, spontaneous T-cell activation is noted when splenic T cells are studied in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we searched for oligoclonal T-cell populations in the blood and spleens of 25 patients with HCL using a T-cell receptor gamma-polymerase chain reaction (TCR gamma-PCR). Subsequently, in 6 patients, the CDR3 length and conformation from 22 different TCRBV subfamilies were analyzed after PCR amplification of cDNA using TCRBV subfamily-specific primers. T cells from 15 of 25 HCL patients showed clonal excess by the TCR gamma-PCR. In fluorescence-activated cell sorted T-cell subsets, more clonal bands were observed than in the unseparated T cells, with most of these in CD8+ subsets, but also in CD4+, CD3+ gamma/delta+, and a double-negative CD3+ alpha/beta+ subset. In other B-cell malignancies, 6 of 16 samples showed oligoclonal T cells, whereas only 2 of 18 normal spleen and blood samples showed abnormal bands. Analysis of the TCRBV subfamilies disclosed in all 6 HCL patients a markedly abnormal pattern, with many clonal bands in 5 to 15 subfamilies, and absent or abnormal weak patterns in another 1 to 8 subfamilies. In comparison, 6 normal samples (2 spleens and 4 blood samples) showed in only 1 blood donor 1 clonal band. Two patients with active HCL but without infections or treatment were tested several times during the course of the disease and showed a complete identical skewed T-cell repertoire with the same oligoclonal T-cell populations.

In LDTI fractions of leukemic cells, lck and lyn are enriched 100-fold as compared with the total cell lysates. Analysis of these fractions by electron microscopy shows the presence of 70- to 200-nm vesicles: lyn and lck are homogenously distributed in the vesicles, as revealed by an immunogold labeling procedure. These novel results propose a role for these vesicles in signal transduction mechanisms of normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells.

However, concern for the risk of long-term complications has resulted in a number of trials to evaluate reduction of therapy. The consequences of these trials on recurrence, development of long-term complications, and survival remain unknown. One major consequence of successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease is the development of second malignant neoplasms. We sought to determine the factors most important for development of second tumors in pathologically staged and treated Hodgkin's disease patients followed for long intervals to provide background information for future clinical trials and guidelines for routine patient follow-up. Between April 1969 and December 1988, 794 patients with laparotomy staged (PS) IA-IIIB Hodgkin's disease were treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone or combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy (CT). There were 8,500 person-years of follow-up (average of 10.7 person-years per patient). Age and gender-specific incidence rates were multiplied by corresponding person-years of observation to obtain expected numbers of events. Observed to expected results were calculated by type of treatment, age at treatment, sex, and time after Hodgkin's disease. Absolute (excess) risk was expressed as number of excess cases per 10,000 person-years. Seventy-two patients have developed a second malignant neoplasm. Eight patients developed acute leukemia, 10 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 53 patients developed solid tumors at a median time of 5 years, 7.25 years, and 12.2 years, respectively, after Hodgkin's disease. One patient developed multiple myeloma 16.5 years after Hodgkin's disease. The relative risk (RR) of developing a second malignancy was 5.6. The absolute excess risk per 10,000 person-years (AR) of developing a second malignancy was 69.6 (7.0% excess risk per person per decade of follow-up). The highest RR occurred for the development of leukemia (RR = 66.2), however because of the low expected risk, the AR was only 9.3. The RR of solid tumors after Hodgkin's disease was lower (4.7); however, the AR was greater (49) than for acute leukemia. Among the solid tumors, breast, gastrointestinal, lung, and soft tissue cancers had the highest absolute excess risks. The risk for developing breast cancer after Hodgkin's disease was greatest in women who were under the age of 25 at treatment. The most significant risk factor for the development of both leukemia and solid tumors was the combined use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The RR following RT alone was 4.1 (AR = 51.1); for RT + CT (initially or at relapse) the RR was 9.75 (P < 0.05, nonoverlapping confidence limits, AR = 123.9). Survival following development of a second malignancy was poor in patients with leukemia, gastrointestinal tumors, lung cancer, and sarcoma. Survival from other malignancies including NHL and breast cancer was more encouraging. Second malignant neoplasms are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality following treatment for Hodgkin's disease. The most significant risk factor for the development of second tumors is the extent of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Recommendations are presented for both prevention and early detection of these tumors.","['Mauch, P M', 'Kalish, L A', 'Marcus, K C', 'Coleman, C N', 'Shulman, L N', 'Krill, E', 'Come, S', 'Silver, B', 'Canellos, G P', 'Tarbell, N J']","['Mauch PM', 'Kalish LA', 'Marcus KC', 'Coleman CN', 'Shulman LN', 'Krill E', 'Come S', 'Silver B', 'Canellos GP', 'Tarbell NJ']","['Joint Center for Radiation Therapy, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63734-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3625-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The junctional sequences represent potentially immunogenic tumor-specific antigens. Despite their intracellular location, the fusion proteins might be recognized immunologically by T lymphocytes if peptides, derived from these unique sequences, are capable of presentation by the major histocompatibility complex molecules. We previously found that four peptides, 9 to 11 amino acids long, spanning the b3a2 CML breakpoint bind with high or intermediate affinity to purified HLA class I molecules A3, A11, B8, or both A3 and A11. We tested the ability of these peptides to elicit specific class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro in HLA-matched healthy donors. In addition, a longer b3a2 CML-breakpoint-derived peptide, 25 aminoacids in length (b3a2-25), was studied for its ability to induce peptide-specific, class II-mediated, T-cell proliferation. In four of four HLA-A3 donors tested, CML-A3/A11-peptide specific CTLs were induced that killed an allogeneic HLA-A3-matched peptide pulsed leukemia cell line. In two of three HLA-A3 donors, the CML-A3/A11 peptide was able to induce killing of autologous and allogeneic HLA-matched peptide-pulsed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CML-A3 peptide induced peptide specific CTLs in one of the four HLA A3 donors tested. No killing was observed in two HLA-B8 and two HLA-A11 donors. PBMC from seven donors were also tested for anti b3a2-25 peptide proliferation in a thymidine incorporation assay. Specific proliferation was detected in three donors, all of the HLA-DR11 haplotype. These data represent the first evidence of a cytolytic human immune response against CML bcr-abl oncogene-derived peptides and provide a rationale for developing peptide-based vaccines for this disease.","['Bocchia, M', 'Korontsvit, T', 'Xu, Q', 'Mackinnon, S', 'Yang, S Y', 'Sette, A', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Bocchia M', 'Korontsvit T', 'Xu Q', 'Mackinnon S', 'Yang SY', 'Sette A', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63729-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3587-92.,,,,"['P01CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These chromosomal anomalies represent one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities associated with these diseases and usually herald a poor prognosis. In this study two cosmid DNA probes that mapped to 7q22.1 and were known to be separated by approximately 500 kb were identified to flank the proximal inversion breakpoint in a patient carrying a constitutional inversion (7q22.1-34) associated with MDS. A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone that encompassed the two cosmids was identified and shown to span the breakpoint. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was then used to analyze six additional patients with myelodysplasia and chromosomal rearrangements of the 7q22 region (three patients had translocations and three carried deletions). The breakpoint in one of the patients was found to be contained within the same YAC clone that spanned the inversion breakpoint. Moreover, this same interval was determined to be absent in all three patients with chromosomal deletions. These results suggest that this segment of DNA on chromosome 7q22.1 may contain specific gene(s) that have a significant role in myeloid malignancies.","['Johnson, E J', 'Scherer, S W', 'Osborne, L', 'Tsui, L C', 'Oscier, D', 'Mould, S', 'Cotter, F E']","['Johnson EJ', 'Scherer SW', 'Osborne L', 'Tsui LC', 'Oscier D', 'Mould S', 'Cotter FE']","['LRF Department of Haematology and Oncology, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63728-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 1;87(9):3579-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variant differs from the previously reported homologue TGH in that it is 199 amino acids shorter and has an alternative, 63 amino acid COOH-terminal peptide. The 3'-untranslated region of the cDNA also differs from the previously reported sequences for both TGH and human tissue transglutaminase.

Because the use of unrelated donors has not been well-characterized, we report on the outcome of 52 patients with MDS or MDS-related AML consecutively treated between 1987 and 1993 with unrelated donor marrow transplantation. The median age was 33 (range 1-53) years. 33 patients received chemotherapy and total body irradiation and the remainder busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The donors were phenotypically identical at the HLA-A, B and Dw/DRB1 loci in 34 cases and mismatched for one HLA locus in 17 cases and two loci in one case. Marrow was non-T-cell depleted and methotrexate with cyclosporine or FK506 was used for postgrafting immunosuppression. The 2-year disease-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality rates were 38%, 28% and 48%, respectively. One patient who relapsed survives disease-free after withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. 16/19 survivors have a performance status of 90-100%. Patients with MDS in transformation or with AML had a significantly higher risk of relapse than patients with less advanced disease (P = 0.0014). Increased non-relapse mortality was significantly associated with higher age, longer disease duration before transplant, lower neutrophil count on admission and, unexpectedly, being seronegative for cytomegalovirus. We conclude that the outcome with transplantation using unrelated donors is similar to reported results using related donors and that a meaningful proportion of eligible patients with an otherwise incurable disease may be cured with this treatment.

She presented with AML 7 months later. In two patients transplanted for AML, XCIP analysis was complicated by constitutively skewed Lyonization patterns, nevertheless a progressive alteration could be demonstrated by serial analyses. In one patient a difference was detectable 28 months before presentation with MDS. In the other patient, despite evident mild pancytopenia and alterations in her XCIPs over the past 4 years, she has developed no definitive myelodysplastic features and oligoclonality due to stem cell failure cannot be excluded. These studies show that XCIPs can be used to predict development of MDS/AML in some patients, but the technique is limited by technical variability and frequent constitutional skewing in the haemopoietic system.","['Gale, R E', 'Bunch, C', 'Moir, D J', 'Patterson, K G', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Linch, D C']","['Gale RE', 'Bunch C', 'Moir DJ', 'Patterson KG', 'Goldstone AH', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4751014.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Apr;93(1):53-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4751014.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it necessary to properly identify and weigh the non-immune factors that have a major impact of refractoriness. A case-control study is suitable for such an analysis, and to our knowledge has not previously been performed to assess this issue. Fifty-two refractory patients were compared with 52 control patients who were transfused at the same time. Only one transfusion event was analysed per patient. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded at the time of selected transfusion, and their association with refractoriness was investigated by the contingency table method and the Cox stepwise logistic regression. There were 16 (31%) patients with HLA antibodies in the index group and only one in the control group. The corrected count increment in the group of patients refractory due to HLA antibodies was significantly lower than that in non-alloimmunized refractory patients [median (range): 48.5 (-3560, 4614) and 4058 (-4417, 6886), respectively; U = 493, P < 0.0001]. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with refractoriness were the presence of HLA antibodies (odds ratio (OR) 50.7; 95% CI 5.5-463); fever (odds ratio 7.2; 95% CI 2.5-21) and BMT because of chronic myeloid leukaemia (odds ratio 7.3; 95% CI 1.8-30). The latter two were the only factors that remained independently associated with refractoriness after excluding alloimmunized patients and their controls. We conclude that HLA antibodies are strongly associated with platelet transfusion refractoriness, but account for less than a third of these patients.

We believe that CLL of the post-thymic T-lymphocytes is a distinct entity, and merits a separate designation from other T-cell leukaemias.","['Wong, K F', 'Chan, J K', 'Sin, V C']","['Wong KF', 'Chan JK', 'Sin VC']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/classification/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/pathology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.457995.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Apr;93(1):157-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.457995.x.,['Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(3):580.

Therefore we measured serum Epo levels in 47 CLL patients to determine whether Epo was a significant factor in the development of their anaemia. Epo levels were increased compared to normal individuals and this elevation appeared adequate for the degree of anaemia. The slope of the regression of Epo versus haemoglobin (Hb) was similar to that of a reference group. Serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels were also appropriately elevated for the degree of anaemia and correlated with serum Epo. Advanced stage was not associated with reduction of Epo production but diminished erythropoietic activity was observed in several patients.

Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse.,131-8,"Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from matched sibling donors has been useful for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children with a poor prognosis but is not available to more than two-thirds of patients who do not have a matched allogeneic donor. This study was undertaken to assess one strategy of marrow graft rejection prevention when alternative marrow sources such as HLA-phenoidentical unrelated volunteers and HLA-partially incompatible relatives were used. Results have been compared with two matched groups of children with the same risks factors and disease status who underwent HLA-genoidentical or autologous BMT. The conditioning regimen was the same for the three groups of patients; in the study group anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies combined with T-cell depletion of the marrow was added to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Nineteen patients were included and followed for a median of 25 months (14 months to 3 years). Bone marrow engraftment occurred in 83% of the evaluable patients. Post-transplantation infectious diseases were the most frequent causes of death in the study group, occurring in 31% of patients. No fatal infections occurred in the two control groups. Post-transplantation relapse of leukaemia occurred in 26% of study group's patients, in 58% of autologous BMT control group's patients and 5% of HLA-genoidentical allogeneic group's patients. The event-free survival was 83% in the HLA-genoidentical control group, and 30% and 24% in the study group and in the autologous control group, respectively. In conclusion, a high rate of engraftment was achieved by the use of anti-LFA-1 and anti CD2 antibodies. Occurrence of a long-lasting immunodeficiency, however, led to a high incidence of lethal infections and relapses. Combined approaches are therefore to be investigated accelerating immune reconstitution after transplantations of T-depleted HLA partially incompatible marrow.","['Cavazzana-Calvo, M', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Michel, G', 'Esperou, H', 'Souillet, G', 'Leblanc, T', 'Stephan, J L', 'Vannier, J P', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Reiffers, J', 'Vilmer, E', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Benkerrou, M', 'Baruchel, A', 'Pico, J', 'Bernaudin, F', 'Bergeron, C', 'Plouvier, E', 'Thomas, C', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Lacour, B', 'Blanche, S', 'Fischer, A']","['Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Bordigoni P', 'Michel G', 'Esperou H', 'Souillet G', 'Leblanc T', 'Stephan JL', 'Vannier JP', 'Mechinaud F', 'Reiffers J', 'Vilmer E', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Benkerrou M', 'Baruchel A', 'Pico J', 'Bernaudin F', 'Bergeron C', 'Plouvier E', 'Thomas C', 'Wijdenes J', 'Lacour B', 'Blanche S', 'Fischer A']","['INSERM U429, Hopital Necker-Engants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4831024.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Apr;93(1):131-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4831024.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The glycophorin A (GPA) mutation assay measures the frequency of variant NO and NN erythrocytes in MN heterozygotes. A raised variant frequency (Vf) has been shown in patients treated with chemotherapy known to be at risk of secondary leukaemia. ALL patients were investigated for increased Vf using the GPA assay. Vfs at diagnosis were not significantly different from controls (NO Vf P = 0.193; NN Vf P = 0.790). During treatment Vfs increased significantly (No Vf P = 0.001; NN Vf P = 0.001). NO Vf returned to control values (P = 0.169) within 5 years from diagnosis but NN Vf remained significantly raised (P = 0.014). Three study patients developed secondary AML. At diagnosis of AML all three had significantly increased Vf. The first had a significantly raised Vf at routine follow-up 19 years following diagnosis of ALL then developed AML 3.5 years later. The second had a significantly raised NN Vf at diagnosis of ALL indicating possibly prior exposure to a mutagen or defective DNA repair involving erythroid stem cells.

Six patients who developed a malignancy of myeloid origin were negative for p53. The presence of p53 alone was associated with a highly significant increased risk of lymphoid malignancies (relative risk (RR)p53 = 6.7, 95% confidence limits (CL) 1.9, 24) whereas high levels of antibody to EBNA2 seemed to be inversely related to the risk (RREBNA2 = 0.1, CL 0.0, 1.1). Among lymphoid malignancies, a combination of serum p53 and high EBNA1 antibody levels gave a greater than expected risk (RRp53 and EBNA1 = 14, CL 1.4, 130; RRexpected = 4.4), whereas interaction with high levels of EBNA5 antibody gave an expected risk (RRp53 and EBNA5 = 19, CL 1.7, 220; RRexpected = 17). Thus detectable levels of p53 appear early in the development of lymphoid malignancies, and high EBNA1 antibody levels, and accumulated p53 may both be synergistic risk indicators for lymphoid malignancies, whereas high EBNA5 antibody levels and accumulation of p53 seem to raise the RR independently of each other.","['Lehtinen, T', 'Luostarinen, T', 'Dillner, J', 'Aromaa, A', 'Hakama, M', 'Hakulinen, T', 'Knekt, P', 'Leinikki, P', 'Lumio, J', 'Lahdeaho, M L', 'Maatela, J', 'Teppo, L', 'Lehtinen, M']","['Lehtinen T', 'Luostarinen T', 'Dillner J', 'Aromaa A', 'Hakama M', 'Hakulinen T', 'Knekt P', 'Leinikki P', 'Lumio J', 'Lahdeaho ML', 'Maatela J', 'Teppo L', 'Lehtinen M']","['Tampere University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/virology', 'Lymphoma/*blood/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Risk', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*blood', 'Viral Proteins/*blood/genetics']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4671000.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Apr;93(1):104-10. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4671000.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of four cancers previously linked with work in the electrical and electronic industry (leukaemia, brain, breast and melanoma), only two were significantly raised: leukaemia (PRR=124, 95% CI=109-142, based on 217 cases) and malignant brain cancer (PRR=118, 95% CI=103-136, based on 204 cases). A significantly increased risk was also observed for pleural cancer (PRR=201, 95% CI=167-241, based on 115 cases). The histology of almost 90% of pleural cancers was coded as mesothelioma, confirming the previously observed association between pleural cancer and exposure to asbestos in electrical workers.

P388- or P388/DOX-bearing mice were given PSC 833 intraperitoneally 30 min before an intravenous injection of DOX. The levels of DOX were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method in leukaemic cells and in normal tissues (heart, lung, liver, small intestine, kidney and spleen). In all tissues, DOX concentrations were significantly increased in mice pretreated with PSC 833. The difference was greatest in P-gp-overexpressing P388/DOX cells, the DOX area under the curve being approximately seven times greater after PSC 833 and DOX than after DOX alone. In P388 cells the difference was approximately 2.5 times, as in the majority of normal tissues. As expected DOX levels in P388 cells were higher than in P388/DOX cells in mice treated with DOX alone, whereas after PSC 833 and DOX the levels of DOX were similar in the two leukaemic lines. In spite of this PSC 833 was unable to reverse the resistance to DOX of P388/DOX leukaemia in vivo, suggesting that mechanisms other than P-gp expression are responsible for resistance.","['Colombo, T', 'Gonzalez Paz, O', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Colombo T', 'Gonzalez Paz O', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Laboratory of Cancer Chemotherapy, Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Tissue Distribution']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.154 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Apr;73(7):866-71. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.154.,,,,,PMC2074272,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR1-transfected and drug-selected tumour cell lines with various levels of drug resistance were examined. The expression of P-gp and its cell-surface appearance were assessed by quantitative immunoblotting and by immunofluorescence cytometry. The transport function of the P-gp was assessed by measuring the extrusion of calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM) with fluorometry and flow cytometry, while in parallel experiments drug resistance was directly examined in cell survival assays. The MDR1 activity factor (MAF), calculated from the calcein AM extrusion assay, is demonstrated to provide a reliable quantitative measure for MDR1 specific activity, reflecting cellular drug resistance.

Cognitive and educational abilities of these groups were evaluated using standardised psychometric techniques. Significant differences in cognitive and educational abilities were found between the children in group 1 (chemotherapy + CRT) and the two control groups, with the children receiving CRT performing less well in a range of tests. Greatest differences were detected for tasks dependent on language function including verbal IQ, reading and spelling. Within group 1 a younger age at treatment (less than 5 years) and a higher dose of CRT (24 Gy vs 18 Gy) were predictive of poor long-term outcome for cognitive and education ability. In contrast, children who received chemotherapy alone, with or without intrathecal methotrexate, performed similarly to healthy controls.

To determine whether NO was involved in silica-induced pulmonary tissue damage, we studied the effects of silica on nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by THP-1 cells, a monocyte-like cell line with properties of the pulmonary alveolar macrophage. Experimental results showed that silica elicited a marked stimulation of nitric oxide production in a time-dependent manner by THP-1 cells in vitro following the priming of these cells with the phorbol ester PMA. Both nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA) and xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol can partially suppress silica-induced NO production in PMA-primed THP-1 cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that, after 2 h of silica exposure, PMA-primed THP-1 cells began to express iNOS mRNA, which reached peak expression at 8 h. Endotoxin treatment of these cells produced a similar effect. These results indicated that silica is a potent inducer of NO production in macrophages and its ability to induce tissue damage may partially be attributed to its ability to initiate excessive production of nitric oxide from macrophages.","['Chen, F', 'Kuhn, D C', 'Gaydos, L J', 'Demers, L M']","['Chen F', 'Kuhn DC', 'Gaydos LJ', 'Demers LM']","['Department of Pathology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Milton S.

Our recent work identified physiologically significant interactions between BPI, lipopolysaccharide, and mononuclear cells. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the interaction between BPI and mononuclear cells is receptor mediated. DESIGN: Labeled BPI was incubated with THP-1 cells in the presence of up to 100-fold excess of unlabeled BPI. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed to evaluate competitive binding and total uptake of BPI. Crosslinking was performed to determine whether BPI binds to a single protein entity. Acid washing experiments and flow cytometric analysis were performed to determine whether BPI remains on the cellular surface. Finally, flow cytometry analysis was used to determine whether BPI incubation with THP-1 cells affects the surface expression of the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein-lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14. RESULTS: Labeled BPI uptake was not inhibited by the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled BPI at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C in the presence of azide. Uptake was not saturable under either condition with incubation concentrations up to 10 microgram/mL. Cross-linking did not show BPI bound to a single entity. Acid washing and flow cytometry experiments disclosed rapid internalization of BPI. Finally, BPI uptake by THP-1 cells had no effect on the surface expression of CD14. CONCLUSIONS: Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein is rapidly internalized by mononuclear cells in a nonspecific fashion not saturable at very high doses, which is consistent with pinocytosis. This process may represent a disposal mechanism for lipopolysaccharide in closed-space infections and may be partially responsible for the rapid clearance of BPI from the peripheral circulation.","['Burnett, R J', 'Lyden, C A', 'Tindal, C J', 'Cave, C M', 'Marra, M N', 'Solomkin, J S']","['Burnett RJ', 'Lyden CA', 'Tindal CJ', 'Cave CM', 'Marra MN', 'Solomkin JS']","['Department of Surgery, University of Cincinnati, Ohio, College of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Surg,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",9716528,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (bactericidal permeability increasing protein)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*metabolism', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/drug effects/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Pinocytosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archsurg.1996.01430140090023 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Surg. 1996 Feb;131(2):200-5; discussion 206. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1996.01430140090023.,,,,"['R01-GM-31754-12A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM-08478-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CML aged 60 years and older included in all protocols with INF-alpha therapy for chronic phase CML at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center were analyzed. They were treated with human leukocyte or recombinant human IFN-alpha 5x10(6) U/m2 daily alone or in combination with hydroxyurea or IFN gamma. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed and their hematologic and cytogenetic responses to IFN-alpha and survival from the initiation of therapy were determined. Results were compared with those of younger patients treated in the same protocols. Treatment-related toxicity was also analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 274 (13%) patients included in trials of IFN-alpha-based regimens for CML were 60 years and older. Older patients had a higher percentage of bone marrow blasts (P = 0.04) and basophils (P = 0.09) than younger patients. Sixty-nine percent achieved a complete hematologic remission with IFN-alpha therapy, and 51% had a cytogenetic response, which was major in 26% and complete (Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells = 0%) in 20%, Their median survival was 64 months, and the estimated 5-year survival rate was 62%. These results were not different from those in younger patients. Twenty-two patients (63%) had at least grade 2 toxicity requiring dose adjustment. The most frequent side effects were neurotoxicity in 31% and chronic fatigue in 29%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML 60 years of age and older respond well to IFN-alpha therapy, but experience more toxicity. This therapy should be considered for these patients if they are otherwise in good condition, with careful attention to IFN-alpha toxicity and its management.","['Cortes, J', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Robertson, L E', 'Pierce, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Robertson LE', 'Pierce S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Basophils/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Texas']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002934397895228 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(97)89522-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1996 Apr;100(4):452-5. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(97)89522-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single base substitution corresponding to a common naturally occurring mutation was introduced into the R region of an HTLV-1-LTR Cat construct. This resulted in derepression of the promoter in a cell line expressing high levels of the R region binding complex when compared to the wild-type LTR promoter.

In this study effects of Rex on the amounts of total, spliced and unspliced RNA from HTLV-1 were determined. In transfected fibroblasts Rex production resulted in reduced amounts of spliced RNA and increased quantities of unspliced RNA in the nucleus. However, the total amount of viral RNA was not affected and the stability of spliced transcripts was not changed, thus indicating that only the rate of splicing was reduced. Rex action also reduced splicing in immortalized human cord blood T-cells. However, the total amount of viral transcripts and the stability of unspliced RNA in these cells were also increased in the presence of Rex. This indicates that Rex also prevents the degradation of unspliced transcripts in T-cells. The changes in the relative amounts of spliced and unspliced RNA induced by Rex were observed not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus. Thus Rex affects the nucleocytoplasmic transport, splicing and stability of HTLV-1 RNA in the nucleus. These observations may suggest that Rex directs the unspliced viral RNA to the cytoplasm via a nuclear compartment that is not accessible to splicing and degradation factors.","['Grone, M', 'Koch, C', 'Grassmann, R']","['Grone M', 'Koch C', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie der Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, rex/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90200-7 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0200 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Apr 15;218(2):316-25. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that LIF is the only one of these factors expressed at detectable levels in the endometrium of women of proven fertility. LIF expression is restricted to the endometrial glands during the secretory/postovulatory phase but is not present in the endometrium during the proliferative/preovulatory phase. The LIF receptor beta is expressed during the proliferative and secretory phases of the cycle and is restricted to the luminal epithelium. The associated signal-transducing component of the LIF receptor, gp130, is also expressed in both the luminal and glandular epithelium throughout the cycle. These results suggest that uterine expression of LIF in humans, like mice, may have a role in regulating embryo implantation, possibly through an autocrine/paracrine interaction between LIF and its receptor at the luminal epithelium.","['Cullinan, E B', 'Abbondanzo, S J', 'Anderson, P S', 'Pollard, J W', 'Lessey, B A', 'Stewart, C L']","['Cullinan EB', 'Abbondanzo SJ', 'Anderson PS', 'Pollard JW', 'Lessey BA', 'Stewart CL']","['Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Roche Research Center, Nutley, NJ 07110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fertility', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Menstrual Cycle/physiology', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reference Values']",1996/04/02 00:00,1996/04/02 00:01,['1996/04/02 00:00'],"['1996/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.7.3115 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 2;93(7):3115-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.7.3115.,,,,"['AI-08785/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-07855/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-30280/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC39771,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the ligand to which SEB bound had a molecular mass of 46 kDa.

In functional studies, antibodies to the MHC class I molecule inhibited T-cell proliferation by at least 50%.

Using anti-cytokine antibodies, we demonstrated that IL-T is identical to the simultaneously described IL-15. When compared to activated monocytes, IL-15 mRNA expression was 6- to 10-fold greater in HuT-102 cells. The predominant IL-15 message from HuT-102 is a chimeric mRNA joining a segment of the R region of the long terminal repeat of HTLV-I and the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of IL-15. Normally, by alternative splicing, this 118-nucleotide R element represents the most 5' region of several HTLV-I transcripts including tax, rex, and env. The introduction of the R element eliminated over 200 nucleotides of the IL-15 5'-UTR, including 8 of 10 upstream AUGs that are present in normal IL-15 messages. On analysis of the 5'-UTR of normal IL-15, we demonstrated that the presence of these 10 upstream AUGs interferes with IL-15 mRNA translation. Thus, IL-15 synthesis by the adult T-cell leukemia line HuT- 102 involves an increase in IL-15 mRNA transcription and translation secondary to the production of an HTLV-I R element fusion message that lacks many upstream AUGs.","['Bamford, R N', 'Battiata, A P', 'Burton, J D', 'Sharma, H', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Bamford RN', 'Battiata AP', 'Burton JD', 'Sharma H', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Codon', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/immunology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1996/04/02 00:00,1996/04/02 00:01,['1996/04/02 00:00'],"['1996/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.7.2897 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 2;93(7):2897-902. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.7.2897.,,,,,PMC39731,,['GENBANK/S81555'],,,,,,,,,,

We have recently developed the GM-CSF mutant E21R, which selectively binds to the alpha chain and behaves as a competitive GM-CSF antagonist. We have now examined the role of E21R on the survival of hemopoietic cells and found that E21R causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) of normal and malignant cells directly in the absence of GM-CSF. The direct apoptotic effect of E21R occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis by E21R was dependent on cells expressing the high-affinity GM-CSF receptor and could be blocked by GM-CSF. Significantly, apoptosis of the cells occurred even in the presence of the survival factors granulocyte CSF and stem cell factor but was prevented by engagement of beta(c) with interleukin 3. The initiation of apoptosis required phosphorylation, transcriptional activity, and protein synthesis. These findings support a model whereby binding of E21R to the alpha chain leads to apoptosis, while beta(c) plays an important role in cell survival. This model may be applicable to other multimeric cytokine receptors and offers a novel approach for the treatment of human leukemia.","['Iversen, P O', 'To, L B', 'Lopez, A F']","['Iversen PO', 'To LB', 'Lopez AF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reference Values', 'Staurosporine', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1996/04/02 00:00,1996/04/02 00:01,['1996/04/02 00:00'],"['1996/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.7.2785 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 2;93(7):2785-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.7.2785.,,,,,PMC39710,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, 10 analogues of VP-16 in which the glycosidyl moiety was replaced with alkyl or arylamino substituents exhibited 5-10-fold better binding affinity for topoisomerase II/DNA complex in human KB cells. A similar increase in the binding affinity was observed in an isolated-nuclei model. The analogues displayed greater or comparable potency to VP-16 in cell growth-inhibition studies and were less affected by cell membrane-associated drug resistance mechanisms, as exemplified by overexpressions of P-glycoprotein multidrug-resistance gene or multidrug resistance-associated protein. Interestingly, in animal studies, analogues least affected by the membrane transport-deficiency phenotypes exhibited low therapeutic index values, thus suggesting that highly efficient modulation of cellular membrane transport defects could perturb the selectivity of antitumor agents for cancer cells.

Morphological and immunological studies were performed according to criteria proposed by the FAB group. A panel of monoclonal antibodies, including at least sIg, CD19, CD5, and FMC7 was used. Interpretations of morphology and cytogenetics were made independently. When applying strict FAB criteria 65% of the cases could be classified. Most of them (44%) were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The cases not satisfying strict FAB criteria could be divided into two groups: one closely related to CLL, and here defined as atypical CLL (aCLL) (21%) and another group consisting of patients with leukemic manifestations of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LL) (14%). Analyzable metaphases were obtained in 89% of patients. Clonal abnormalities were present in 35% of patients. The most frequent chromosomal changes were abnormalities of chromosome 11q (60 cases), trisomy 12 (46 cases) and structural rearrangements of chromosome 14q (44 cases). Statistical associations with FAB subtypes were found: aCLL and trisomy 12 (P < 0.00001); mantle zone lymphoma (MZL) and t(11;14) (P < 0.00001) and del(6)(q) (P < 0.0001); CLL/mixed cell type and del(6)(q) (P < 0.002); follicular lymphoma and t(14;18) (P < 0.00001); splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and del(7)(q) (P < 0.0004); leukemic lymphoma (LL) with rearrangements in chromosome 9q (P < 0.0001) and trisomy of 3 (P < 0.001). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not statistically associated with any specific chromosomal abnormality. However, this subtype showed a high incidence of del(11)(q) and rearrangements of 13q. This study confirms the value of cytogenetic investigation in the diagnosis of these disorders and may provide some new elements for future refinement of the FAB classification in mature B cell lymphocytic disorders.","['Hernandez, J M', 'Mecucci, C', 'Criel, A', 'Meeus, P', 'Michaux, I', 'Van Hoof, A', 'Verhoef, G', 'Louwagie, A', 'Scheiff, J M', 'Michaux, J L']","['Hernandez JM', 'Mecucci C', 'Criel A', 'Meeus P', 'Michaux I', 'Van Hoof A', 'Verhoef G', 'Louwagie A', 'Scheiff JM', 'Michaux JL', 'et al.']","['Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/immunology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2140-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the 15-35% incidence of false negative results with this approach has been a constant and unresolved problem. To assess the reliability of a previously published framework region 3 (FR3A) IgH-CDR3-PCR for detection of monoclonal IgH gene rearrangements we compared the PCR and Southern results in a series of 44 NHL and leukemias of B cell lineage showing a JH-rearrangement in Southern analysis with genomic DNA and hybridization with a IgH joining region (JH) probe. IgH-CDR3 regions were amplified using DNA extracted from clinical specimens by PCR using fluorescent dye-labeled consensus primers homologous to conserved regions within the variable (VH) and the joining (JH) gene segments. The PCR products were size separated on a high resolution polyacrylamide gel and analyzed for clonality by exact size determination and fluorescence quantification in an automated DNA sequencer. With commonly used DNA polymerases monoclonal IgH-CDR3 junctions were identified in 36/44 samples (82%). However, in the remaining eight cases (18%) with pathohistologically clearly demonstrated B cell malignancies which were also monoclonal on JH-Southern analysis, monoclonality could be demonstrated by FR3A-IgH-CDR3-PCR only with the proofreading UITma DNA polymerase. In four of these monoclonal VH--N--DH--N--JH junctions sequence analysis was performed which showed a point mutation in one and a single nucleotide deletion at the 3' terminus of the primer target site in the other case. In the remaining two cases no primer mismatches could be identified. Thus we conclude that the marked improvement of the PCR-detection rate of monoclonal IgH-CDR3 junctions was achieved at least in part due to the ability of UITma DNA polymerase to remove mismatched bases at the 3' terminus of the primers with respect to the target during the first amplification cycles. Our results suggest, that UITma is the DNA polymerase of choice for amplification of IgH-CDR3 junctions with consensus FR3A-VH- and JH-primers.","['Linke, B', 'Bolz, I', 'Pott, C', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Kneba, M']","['Linke B', 'Bolz I', 'Pott C', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kneba M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Georg-August University, Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2133-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the detection of clonal Ig lambda (Ig lambda) gene rearrangements, we carefully determined the precise restriction map of the J-C lambda gene region, developed a suitable C lambda probe (IGLC3), and evaluated relevant restriction enzymes in combination with the IGLC3 probe. For the latter purpose, we selected 75 B cell malignancies with proven expression of Ig lambda protein chains in order to be sure that each malignancy contained at least one clonally rearranged IG lambda allele. Our extensive Southern blot analyses with the IGLC3 probe in EcoRI and/or HindIII digests revealed that combined EcoRI/HindIII digestion detected Ig lambda gene rearrangements in 95% of the 75 patients and 94% of the 98 rearranged alleles. In contrast, HindIII and EcoRI single digests allowed detection of rearrangements in only 78% and 83% of the patients, and 67% and 79% of rearranged alleles, respectively. We conclude that the use of the IGLC3 probe in combined EcoRI/HindIII digests is superior to EcoRI and HindIII single digests.

The aim of the analysis, comprising 111 patients with multiple myeloma, was to study possible correlations between karyotype and a morphologic classification proposed by Bartl et al. Grade of plasma cell infiltration, predominant cell types (Marschalko, small, cleaved, polymorphous, asynchronous, blastic) and grade of malignancy are the basis of this classification. A pathologic karyotype was found in the bone marrow of 39/111 patients (35%). The incidence of chromosomal anomalies closely correlated with the grade of infiltration, plasma cell type and grade of malignancy. Chromosomal anomalies were rarely detected in patients with low infiltration (16%), but they were frequently found in high-grade infiltration (69%). A low incidence was found in Marschalko (25%) or small cell type (15%); the incidence was much higher in cleaved (75%), asynchronous (65%) and basic cell types (71%). An abnormal karyotype was more frequently found in high (71%) than in intermediate (53%) or low (23%)-grade malignant multiple myeloma. The most consistent structural chromosomal aberration found in five patients was translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32). In four of the five patients small, often cleaved plasma cells were the predominant cell types. These reported correlations between morphological and cytogenetic findings must be confirmed by future studies.","['Weh, H J', 'Bartl, R', 'Seeger, D', 'Selbach, J', 'Kuse, R', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Weh HJ', 'Bartl R', 'Seeger D', 'Selbach J', 'Kuse R', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Medical University Clinic, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*pathology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2119-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to compare results obtained by CC and by FISH for the detection of numeric chromosomal changes in patients with MM. PC DNA content, CC and interphase FISH analysis were performed on 29 consecutive patients with MM. Fifteen patients (control group) had known Cytogenetic abnormalities identified by CC. The other 14 patients (study group) had a normal karyotype but an abnormal DNA content. Bone marrow material prepared for CC or cytospin slides were probed with classical satellite III or alpha satellite DNA sequences for chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 15 (chromosomes 3, 7, 9, 11, 15 probes for hyperdiploid patients and the chromosome 8 probe for hypodiploid patients). In the control group, an unexplained discrepancy between CC and FISH occurred for only one chromosome in one patient. Also in this group, four patients had only one abnormal cell by CC and the numeric changes in these patients were always confirmed by FISH analysis. In the study group, FISH analysis showed an abnormal result in all but one patient. From these data, we conclude that FISH improves the detection of cytogenetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma. Using commercially available DNA probes for the most frequent numeric changes and slides for CC or cytospin slides, we demonstrated abnormal cytogenetics by FISH in 28/29 patients. In further studies, use of FISH could permit a more accurate description of numeric changes and their prognostic value in MM as well as an approach to clonal evolution.

We characterized its morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and proliferative capacity. Developed in the absence of exogenous lymphokines, KBM-7 in vitro cloning capacity actually decreased when colony-stimulating factors were added. The cells had an aberrant immature myeloid phenotype, a doubling time of 22 h in suspension cultures and a high cloning efficiency in semisolid system (24 +/- 3)%. Early passages contained one near-haploid (predominant) and one hyperdiploid stem line. Gradually the hyperdiploid stem line became predominant, reaching an average of 49 chromosomes per cell. Cells from passage 89 had two Philadelphia chromosomes [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] and lacked normal copies of chromosomes 9 and 22. Detailed molecular characterization of the breakpoint in the t(9;22)(q34;q11) revealed that KBM-7 had the BCR 2/ABL II splice junction. The cells had high protein kinase (p210BCR-ABL) activity and carried two identified variants of an ABL-BCR message. There was no evidence that normal BCR or c-ABL messages were expressed, assessed with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. When KBM-7 cells were heterotransplanted into nude mice without immunosuppressive pretreatment, one of three mice injected with 1 x 10(7) cells and all mice injected with 1 x 10(8) cells developed slowly growing granulocytic sarcomas within 6-8 weeks. These tumors were locally invasive but did not metastasize. We conclude that the KBM-7 cell line will be of value for investigating molecular events underlying neoplastic transformation in CML, in particular for studying the effects of BCR-ABL and ABL-BCR on the proliferation of CML cells in the absence of normal BCR and c-ABL messages.","['Andersson, B S', 'Collins, V P', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Larkin, D W', 'Childs, C', 'Ost, A', 'Cork, A', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Siciliano, M J']","['Andersson BS', 'Collins VP', 'Kurzrock R', 'Larkin DW', 'Childs C', 'Ost A', 'Cork A', 'Trujillo JM', 'Freireich EJ', 'Siciliano MJ', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2100-8.,,,,"['CA 16672-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Undifferentiated cells expressed the greatest numbers of flt3/flk-2 receptors: 19% of primitive lin-kit+sca-1+ bone marrow cells and 16% of fetal liver lin-aa4.1+ cells exhibited over 15 000 receptors per cell as determined by binding of the radiolabeled cognate ligand (flt3/flk-2 ligand, FL). Moderate binding was demonstrated on early B lymphocyte subsets (4400 receptors per cell) and very low levels were detected on monocytes. Binding was not detected on promyelocytes, myelocytes, promonocytes, metamyelocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, eosinophils or nucleated erythroid cells. FL enhanced the survival of primitive lin kit+sca-1+ cells with an efficacy s with an efficacy equivalent to stem cell factor (SCF). FL stimulated predominantly blast and granulocyte-macrophage colony formation in cultures of bone marrow cells by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Marked synergistic effects of FL with combinations of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) or interleukin-6 occurred in the proliferation of primitive lin-kit+sca-1+ cells, but not lin-kit+sca-1- progenitor cells. Surprisingly, recloning experiments revealed that FL plus IL-3 increased the generation of progenitor cells by lin-kit a-1- cells compared with SCF plus IL-3.

Recent data have demonstrated that apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms through which both cytotoxic and differentiating drugs may eliminate malignant cells. Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the first model of differentiation therapy allowing achievement of more than 90% complete remission (CR). However, disease-free survival (DFS) is short if patients are not subsequently treated with chemotherapy. In order to address the question of APL cells' elimination during ATRA therapy, we studied phenotypic and molecular features of 14 APL cases relative to cell survival in primary culture in the presence or absence of ATRA. Compared to other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, APL cells in short-term suspension culture present a better survival rate (P < 0.001). After incubation with ATRA, cell survival was not altered and was correlated with a concomitant absence of apoptosis, despite a significant decrease of the BcL-2 protein in APL differentiated cells. Indeed, after 6 days of culture, only 3 +/- 0.5% of APL cells exhibit morphological features of apoptosis after ATRA treatment compared to 30 +/- 5% in HL-60-treated cells. Treatment of APL cells with 9-cis RA, 13-cis RA or analogs of RAR alpha or RXR alpha also failed to induce apoptosis. Treatment of either APL or ATRA-differentiated APL cells with 40 microM etoposide resulted in DNA fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in 23 +/- 5% cells after only 20 h of treatment and 68 +2- 3% after 48 h suggesting that other pathways of apoptosis are still functional in APL cells. Though these in vitro data cannot fully represent the mechanism of cell death and cell elimination in vivo, they clearly indicate that ATRA alone may not induce leukemic clone eradication by apoptosis correlating with the persistence of minimal residual disease and constant relapse after CR obtained with ATRA alone.","['Calabresse, C', 'Barbey, S', 'Venturini, L', 'Balitrand, N', 'Degos, L', 'Fenaux, P', 'Chomienne, C']","['Calabresse C', 'Barbey S', 'Venturini L', 'Balitrand N', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Universite Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2049-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, expression of CD49f and CD66a was not found in untreated or VitD3-induced cells.

The retinoid specific induction of CD49f and CD66a was confirmed in the related monoblastic cell line THP-1. Human blood monocytes and the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 responded poorly to RA, with respect to the regulation of CD49f and CD66a expression, indicating that early monocytic precursors were targets for the retinoid-specific regulation.

Here, we show that the PML protein, like Sp100 and NDP52, is induced by interferons (IFNs alpha, beta and gamma) in a large variety of human cells. Interestingly, the NBs that contain the three IFN-induced proteins appear to be associated to speckles labelled by the IFN-mediator Mx1. These observations link NBs to IFN response pathways, which may contribute to the elucidation of the biological role of these structures. In APL cells, IFNs induced both PML and PML/RAR alpha expression, resulting in an increased sequestration of PML and RXRs in the microspeckles induced by the fusion protein. As PML has growth suppressing properties, it may mediate some of the antiproliferative effects of IFN.

Similar transcripts are also found in neoplastic myeloid cells, but are of unknown significance. We have mapped these RNAs using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification. Unlike B cell transcripts, the majority of myeloid mu transcripts do not contain amplifiable enhancer sequence or complete 5' sequence. The extent of this deletion is related to the degree of myeloid maturation, with transcripts in the most primitive myeloid cells more closely resembling those in B cells. Variable 3'-splicing patterns are also observed in myeloid cells, unlike the single pattern identified in early B cells. Using primers which span the region from the 3' end of C mu 4 to the 5' end of the second membrane exon (M2), the splice sites between C mu 4 and M1, and between M1 and M2 have been analyzed. Our data suggest that factors important in initiation of germline mu transcription are present in both B lymphoid and myeloid cells, but that lineage-specific modifying factors alter this expression during myeloid maturation.

A dominant molecular defect has not yet been identified: both deletions and breakpoint-specific events have been postulated. We have generated a model in which chromosome 2 lesions have been generated in vitro in a clonal tumor cell line. In this study cytogenetic and molecular comparisons are made between two of these in vitro generated lesions and eight derived in vivo: seven by the conventional radiation protocol, and one by infection with Moloney leukemia virus. All 10 lines consistently exhibited hemizygous loss of an 18 cM region between Hoxd-4 and II-1 alpha, with variable breakpoints at both ends. These results are consistent with deletion of a gene in common rather than breakpoint-specific events, for lesions resulting from all three protocols. This will allow a novel approach to the identification of a putative tumor suppressor gene, ie to describe the biological effect of the in vitro generated deletion, and to clone the gene by complementation. In preparation for this approach, we have further narrowed the region to approximately 6.5 cM by microsatellite mapping of 22 radiation-induced F1 tumors. In addition, we have eliminated the possibility that imprinting ablates expression from the remaining undeleted chromosome.","['Alexander, B J', 'Rasko, J E', 'Morahan, G', 'Cook, W D']","['Alexander BJ', 'Rasko JE', 'Morahan G', 'Cook WD']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, University of Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):2009-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that karyotypic abnormalities are relatively stable and that certain abnormalities may be associated with a poor prognosis. In a prospective 5-year study of 45 patients with typical CLL, sequential karyotypic studies were undertaken every 6-12 months. Clonal karyotypic abnormalities were identified in 62% of patients, either at diagnosis or during the study period with 38% (17/45) exhibiting clonal evolution. In patients with no clinical disease progression, 13q abnormalities were most commonly detected compared with 11q deletions in patients with progressive disease. Karyotypic evolution was significantly associated with progressive disease (12/16, 75% vs 5/29, 17%; P < 0.001, chi2).

Fifty-two patients (pts) with a median age of 51.5 years (16-68), were given interferon alpha (IFN alpha) (5 millions/m2/day, subcutaneously). The median interval between diagnosis and IFN alpha was 41.5 days (0-160). The doses of INF alpha were adjusted to maintain the white blood cell (WBC) count between 1.5 and 5 x 10(9)/l and the platelet count between 50 and 100 x 10(9)/l. At diagnosis, Sokal's criteria were used to classify patients into three groups: low (n = 24), intermediate (n = 19) and high risk (n = 9). A complete hematological response (CHR) was achieved in 42 cases (80.7%). A partial response was present in nine; only one patient did not respond. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the age at diagnosis was found to influence the CHR rate (P = 0.06). Cytogenetic response was evaluated in 46 responder patients. Twenty-three patients achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCR) which was either partial ( > or = 65% pH negative cells) (n = 3) or complete (CCR) (n = 20). By univariate analysis, two disease-related variables were found to influence the MCR rate in 40 evaluable CHR patients: spleen size at diagnosis and peripheral blood blast percentage. However, using either univariate or multivariate analysis, the most significant factor was the achievement of CHR within 3 months (P < 0.0004 and P < 0.0002, respectively). These results show that IFN alpha can induce high rates of hematological and cytogenetic responses when administered in doses leading to myelosuppression. The achievement of CHR within 3 months could be useful to identify early, those patients who will not respond to IFN alpha and who need alternative treatments such as allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Montastruc, M', 'Mahon, F X', 'Faberes, C', 'Marit, G', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Puntous, M', 'Pigneux, A', 'Boiron, J M', 'Bernard, P']","['Montastruc M', 'Mahon FX', 'Faberes C', 'Marit G', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Puntous M', 'Pigneux A', 'Boiron JM', 'Bernard P', 'et al.']","['Service des malades du sang, CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Dec;9(12):1997-2002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases with 'lineage switch' or 'clonal selection' were excluded. Epipodophyllotoxin-related AML developed in 32 of 1140 patients treated for ALL and in three of 332 treated for NHL; it was a first adverse event in 25 and two cases, respectively. The complication was diagnosed at 12-130 months (median 34 months) after the initiation of treatment with epipodophyllotoxins; all but one of the cases occurred within 73 months, indicating that the risk is negligible after 6 years. The predominant karyotypic feature was 11q23 translocations (71% of cases); 21q22 rearrangements were rare. In a stepwise Cox regression analysis, two factors increased the risk of this complication: weekly or twice weekly administration of epipodophyllotoxins (P < 0.001); and the administration of asparaginase immediately before epipodophyllotoxin therapy (P < 0.001). Initial responses to salvage therapy were comparable to those reported for de novo AML: 92% of the evaluable patients entered complete remission after combination treatment. Single-agent therapy with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine induced complete or partial remissions in one-half of the patients treated. The long-term survival rate was dismal. Of the 17 evaluable patients treated exclusively with chemotherapy, only one is alive at 84 months, compared to three of 16 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (alive at 10, 23 and 73 months).

Search for the factors responsible for the respective abnormalities revealed that the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), mainly granulocyte-CSF, by the tumors could explain the hypercalcemia and leukocytosis, respectively. With regard to the severe cachexia, the production of two cachexia-associated cytokines, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, was able to explain the syndrome in OCC-1 bearing nude mice; however, the factor responsible in LC-1 bearing nude mice could not be identified. The triple paraneoplastic syndrome that developed in these two animal models could be explained partly by concomitant production of the peptide hormone and cytokines by cancer cells.

The antiproliferative effects of 1 and 2.5 Gy ionizing radiation were significantly enhanced by preincubating cells with bryostatin-1 at a concentration (10 nM) and time frame (24h) associated with down-regulation of total cellular protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Potentiation by bryostatin-1 of the radiation effect on proliferation was not associated with a concomitant increase in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, in the fraction of cells exhibiting apoptotic morphology, or in the extent of radiation-induced single- or double-strand breaks in bulk DNA. Staurosporine, a potent but nonspecific inhibitor of PKC, was ineffective in altering the radiosensitivity of HL-60 cells or the degree of DNA fragmentation induced by ionizing radiation.

Using a fluorescent multimeric construct of rCD2, we previously identified an additional CD2 ligand (CD2L) on the erythroleukemic cell line K562. CD2L bound to a different region of CD2 than known ligands and was N-glycosylation dependent. In this study we show that mAbs specific for the carbohydrate Ag Lewis x (CD15, Gal-beta 1-4 GlcNAc alpha 1-3Fuc) inhibit multimeric rCD2 binding to CD2L. CD2L is restricted in expression to myeloid cells, where it is co-expressed with CD58 on monocytes and is the dominant, if not sole, CD2 ligand on neutrophils. Sugar specificity studies show that CD2L is not CD15. Thus, whereas soluble Lewis x inhibits binding of CD15 mAb to K562 and neutrophils, binding of multimeric rCD2 is unaffected. Furthermore, multimeric rCD2 binding to K562 is inhibited by L-fucose and following treatment of K562 with an alpha 1-6 fucosidase, whereas these treatments do not inhibit the binding of CD15 mAb. Thus, it is likely that CD2L is a carbohydrate structure closely associated with, yet distinct from, CD15, which can be sterically blocked by CD15 mAb.

OBJECTIVE: We studied the clinical and histologic findings in three patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation and subsequently had a cutaneous eruption associated with the use of GCSF. METHODS: Biopsy specimens taken at the height of the eruption were studied histologically and immunohistochemically. RESULTS: The patients had indurated, well-demarcated, occasionally annular, erythematous desquamation after withdrawal of the medication. Distinctive histologic features consisted of mild epidermal spongiosis overlying a dermal infiltrate of enlarged, plump macrophages. Increased expression of the vascular adhesion molecules ELAM-1 and VCAM-1, as well as the histologic keratinocyte-produced ICAM-1, was noted. CONCLUSION: the clinical and histological findings of the cutaneous reaction to GCSF are characteristic and allow its distinction from other eruptions that occur in bone marrow transplant recipients.","['Glass, L F', 'Fotopoulos, T', 'Messina, J L']","['Glass LF', 'Fotopoulos T', 'Messina JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Carcinoma/therapy', 'E-Selectin/analysis', 'Epidermis/pathology', 'Erythema/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Keratinocytes/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous/*etiology/pathology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(96)90439-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90439-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1996 Mar;34(3):455-9. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90439-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With regard to the BM mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of normal subjects, the DCC protein expression ranged from 6.6 to 57.0%. Two-color flow cytometry revealed that among the IBM-MNCs the DCC protein was clearly expressed on the CD14+, CD13+, and factor 8+ cells, whereas it was low on the CD19+ and CD7+ cells and did not express on the CD34+, CD8+, and the glycophorin A+ cells. Further, the DCC protein expression was not seen on the PB CD11b+ and CD13+ cells. The IP results revealed that the 180-kD DCC protein was detected on the MNCs of both the BM and PB cells by the antibodies AF5, specific for the DCC extracellular domain, and G97-449, specific for the cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, flow cytometry did not detect the DCC protein on any BM-MNC MDS lineages (0.1-1.5%) or on AML leukemic cells (0.1-0.9%). The IP results indicated that the AF5 antibody did not detect the DCC protein on BM-MNCs of three of five MDS patients and four of five AML patients; however, the G97-449 antibody detected the 180-kD DCC protein in two MDS patients in whom AF5 had detected greatly reduced DCC band. These findings suggest that the DCC protein presence appears to be associated with normal hematopoiesis, and that its absence on the surfaces of the BM-MNCs and AML cells may contribute to the MDS and AML pathogenesis.","['Inokuchi, K', 'Miyake, K', 'Takahashi, H', 'Dan, K', 'Nomura, T']","['Inokuchi K', 'Miyake K', 'Takahashi H', 'Dan K', 'Nomura T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DCC Receptor)', '0 (DCC protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DCC Receptor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118486 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Feb 1;97(3):852-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI118486.,,,,,PMC507125,,,,,,,,,,,,

By multiparameter flow cytometric measurements of cell recovery after culture on stromal layers, we assessed the growth potential of 70 cases of newly diagnosed B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and related the findings of treatment outcome in a single program of chemotherapy. The numbers of leukemic cells recovered after 7 d of culture ranged from < 1 to 292% (median, 91%). The basis of poor cell recoveries from stromal layers appeared to be a propensity of the lymphoblasts to undergo apoptosis. The probability of event-free survival at 4 yr of follow-up was 50 +/- 9% (SE) among patients with higher cell recoveries ( > 91%), and 94 +/- 6% among those with reduced cell recoveries (+/- 91%; P = 0.0003). The prognostic value of leukemic cell recovery after culture exceeded estimates for all other recognized high-risk features and remained the most significant after adjustment with all competing covariates. Thus, the survival ability of leukemic cells on bone marrow-derived stromal layers reflects aggressiveness of the disease and is a powerful, independent predictor of treatment outcome in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Kumagai, M', 'Manabe, A', 'Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Hancock, M L', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Crist, W M', 'Campana, D']","['Kumagai M', 'Manabe A', 'Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hancock ML', 'Mahmoud H', 'Crist WM', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118474 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Feb 1;97(3):755-60. doi: 10.1172/JCI118474.,,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC507113,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated BIBW22 in comparison to dexniguldipine and verapamil as modifier of MDR in blasts of de novo, relapsed or persistent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro. All patients with relapsed or persistent AML had been pretreated with idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside. The degree of MDR was determined by efflux kinetics of rhodamine 123 (R123), daunorubicin, and idarubicin measured by flow cytometry (FACS). A total of 51 patients with AML, 25 de novo and 26 relapsed or persistent, were investigated. While only 6 out of 25 de novo AML blast populations showed moderate efflux of R123 and daunorubicin, 17 out of 26 blast populations of relapsed or persistent AML had an efflux between 20% and 44% within 15 min ex vivo. This efflux could be significantly inhibited by 1 microM BIBW22, 1 microM dexniguldipine, or 10 microM verapamil. For idarubicin we found an effusion of 40+/-9% within 15 min in all blast populations that could not be inhibited by the modulators. Clinically achievable drug concentrations causing only moderate side-effects are in the range of 0.5 microM dexniguldipine and 3 microM verapamil. Up to now, BIBW22 has not been investigated clinically. Thus the potential toxicity of concentrations of 0.5-1 microM BIBW22, sufficient for an optimal efflux inhibition ex vivo, is not known yet.

Leukemic cells from patients with progressive disease demonstrated higher in vitro survival, compared with non-progressive B-CLL and normal B cells. All cells were sensitive to treatment with a combination of glucocorticoid and cAMP. Bcl-2 protein levels were not related to clinical progression, as measured by flow cytometry. Competitive PCR showed that Bcl-2 mRNA was over-expressed in most of the B-CLL samples and that p53 mRNA expression was similar between B-CLL groups and normal values and thus not related to clinical progression. However, since Bax alpha expression was lower in progressive than in non-progressive patients, the Bcl-2/Bax alpha ratio at the mRNA level was significantly higher in the progressive group. Our data suggest that the Bcl-2/Bax alpha ratio is important for the regulation of B-CLL cell survival, that p53 over-expression in progressive B-CLL is the result of post-transcriptional modifications and that a directed PKA activation may potentiate the cytolytic effect of glucocorticoids in vivo.","['Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'Rottenberg, M E', 'Lewin, N', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Jondal, M']","['Aguilar-Santelises M', 'Rottenberg ME', 'Lewin N', 'Mellstedt H', 'Jondal M']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/04/22 00:00,2000/06/20 00:00,['1996/04/22 00:00'],"['1996/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 00:00 [medline]', '1996/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960422)69:2<114::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960422)69:2<114::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Apr 22;69(2):114-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960422)69:2<114::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous exposure of the cells to MTX with stepwise escalation of the drug concentrations resulted in a MTX-resistant sub-line (MOLT-3/MTX(10000)) with impaired reduced-folate carrier (RFC) and increased dihydro-folate-reductase (DHFR) activity. Conversely, a MTX-resistant clone (MOLT-3/MTX. P-9) with unaltered RFC and DHFR activity, but with decreased cellular accumulation of anti-folates, was selected by high-dose short-term treatment of the cells with MTX. MTX resistance in the latter cells was pronounced after short-term rather than continuous-exposure incubation with MTX, suggesting defective polyglutamation of the drug. On the other hand, 2 ZD1694-resistant sub-lines which were established by continuous (MOLT-3/ZD1694. C) or by pulsatile drug-exposure schedule (MOLT-3/ZD1694.P-9) demonstrated extremely low accumulation and poor retention of [3H]ZD1694, with no change in initial drug uptake and little or no increase of thymidylate-synthase (TS) activity irrespective of drug exposure conditions for their establishment. HPLC analysis displayed a virtual absence of ZD1694 polyglutamates in both ZD1694-resistant sub-lines and low accumulation in MOLT-3/MTX.p-9 as compared to the parent line. However, folylpolyglutamate-synthetase(FPGS) mRNA was only moderately decreased in the 2 ZD1694-resistant sub-lines and to an even lesser extent in MOLT-3/MTX.p-9. In addition, gamma-glutamyl-hydrolase(GGH) activity was not increased, but was slightly down-regulated in the polyglutamation-defective sub-lines.

By Northern blot analysis, HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines were found to express a number of chemokine genes at variable levels and in different combinations. However, none of the chemokine genes was expressed in HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines. We further confirmed secretion of 3 chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1alpha and RANTES) by some HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. To examine the role of the HTLV-1-encoded transactivator Tax in the induction of these chemokine genes, we used JPX-9 and JPX-M, which were stably transformed with tax and non-functional tax, respectively, under the control of a metallothionein promoter. Induction of tax in JPX-9 with Cd2+ was accompanied by rapid induction of IL-8, IP-10, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, 1309 and SCM-1 as determined by reverse transcription PCR. No such induction was seen in JPX-M. We thus suggest that Tax is, at least in part, responsible for constitutive expression of certain chemokine genes in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Aberrant production of various chemokines by HTLV-1- infected T cells may impact on the pathophysiology of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Baba, M', 'Imai, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Yoshie, O']","['Baba M', 'Imai T', 'Yoshida T', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/*microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/28 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/28 00:00'],"['1996/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960328)66:1<124::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960328)66:1<124::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-C [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Mar 28;66(1):124-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960328)66:1<124::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To compare efficiency of these constructs in their ability to generate protein expression in the appropriate target cells and optimal viral titers, we used the BOSC23 transient packaging cell line. We found that the direct-oriented vector did not ensure tissue-specificity of PML-RARalpha expression, while the reverse-oriented retroviral vector did.

The megakaryocytic leukemia cell line CMK expressed high levels of rhoA and rhoC mRNAs, whereas rhoB mRNA was expressed at a very low level. The addition of C3 to the culture medium caused ADP-ribosylation of the rho proteins in CMK cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This procedure also induced a higher frequency of polyploid cells with increased glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antigens on the cells. This effect of C3 on both ploidy and the antigen expression was abolished by prior incubation of C3 with an anti-C3 monoclonal antibody. Cytochalasin B, an actin polymerization inhibitor, also induced polyploid cells; however, it did not stimulate the expression of GP IIb/IIIa antigens in CMK cells. This finding suggests that C3-induced increase in the expression of GP IIb/IIIa antigens was not through the actin microfilament disassembly.

The persistence of the increased number of nevi over time and the relationship with personal (e.g. phenotype) and disease related variables remain to be explored. METHODS: One hundred Italian patients diagnosed as having acute lymphatic or myeloid leukemia, after 1975, were recruited and compared with a group of 100 control individuals drawn from friend of the enrolled patients. Information regarding lifetime sun exposure, phenotypic characteristics, and number of nevi was collected by experienced dermatologists. Counts of nevi were expressed both as totals and as counts per unit of body surface area (""density""). Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to control for potentially confounding factors when comparing patients and controls. RESULTS: The patients and controls were fairly comparable in terms of constitutional characteristics, but the patients had a significantly higher number and density of nevi > or = 2 mm or larger in diameter. In addition, patients had a greater number of large nevi ( > or = 6 mm in greatest dimension), and of nevi in unusual areas, such as the palms and soles. Differences in nevus density between patients and controls were notably maintained in the older age group ( > 12 years). None of the disease-related factors analyzed (e.g. treatment protocol and radiotherapy), appeared to be significantly correlated with nevus density. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of childhood leukemia have a sustained increase in their nevus density. A fairly convincing body of evidence indicates that a large number of melanocytic nevi is the strongest risk factor for melanoma. Therefore, the utility of periodic skin examination of these should be considered.","['Naldi, L', 'Adamoli, L', 'Fraschini, D', 'Corbetta, A', 'Imberti, L', 'Reseghetti, A', 'Reciputo, A', 'Rossi, E', 'Cainelli, T', 'Masera, G']","['Naldi L', 'Adamoli L', 'Fraschini D', 'Corbetta A', 'Imberti L', 'Reseghetti A', 'Reciputo A', 'Rossi E', 'Cainelli T', 'Masera G']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Milan, Bergamo General Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Nevus, Pigmented/*etiology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology']",1996/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960401)77:7<1402::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960401)77:7<1402::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Apr 1;77(7):1402-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960401)77:7<1402::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is further proffered that an understanding of the physical and chemical states of molecules which under pathologic conditions become exposed to effector components of the immunosurveillance network will give rise to new immunotherapeutic venues.","['Packard, B Z']",['Packard BZ'],"['OncoImmunin, Inc., College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Ther,Biotechnology therapeutics,8918082,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/*physiology', 'Intracellular Fluid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biotechnol Ther. 1994-1995;5(3-4):127-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was assessed by (1) comparing the lengths of portions of the VHDJH of the IgG+ CLL clones with those of the mu and alpha isotype-expressing B cells, (2) performing clone-specific endonuclease digestion studies, and (3) determining the DNA sequences of the mu and alpha isotype-expressing cDNA. Thus, when B-cell mRNA from these five patients were reverse transcribed with C gamma-specific primers and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction, dominant cDNA were found with lengths corresponding to those of the IgG+ CLL B cell. In addition, in four cases, cDNA of lengths identical to those of the CLL B cell were detected when mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using c mu- and/or C alpha-specific primers, strongly suggesting clonal relatedness. These CLL-related mu- and alpha-expressing cDNA were present in greater amounts that unrelated (non-CLL) mu- and alpha-expressing cDNA from normal B cells that used genes of the same VH family. When the sequences of these CLL-related C mu- and C alpha-expressing cDNA were compared with those of the IgG+ CLL clones, it was clear that they were derived from the same ancestral gene as the IgG-expressing CLL B cell, thus documenting their common origin. Finally, nucleotide point mutations were observed in the mu- and alpha-expressing cDNA of certain patients, indicating divergence with the CLL. These data suggest that IgM+ B cells, which are precursors of the leukemic B cells, exist in increased numbers in the blood of most patients with IgG+ B-CELL and that these cells may differentiate, accumulate V genes mutations, and undergo isotype switching in vivo. In addition, the data are consistent with a sequential-hit model for the evolution of CLL.","['Dono, M', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Fais, F', 'Trejo, V', 'Allen, S L', 'Lichtman, S M', 'Schulman, P', 'Vinciguerra, V P', 'Sellars, B', 'Gregersen, P K', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Chiorazzi, N']","['Dono M', 'Hashimoto S', 'Fais F', 'Trejo V', 'Allen SL', 'Lichtman SM', 'Schulman P', 'Vinciguerra VP', 'Sellars B', 'Gregersen PK', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68632-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1586-94.,,,,['AI 10811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies from 39 patients with HCL in complete remission (CR) 3 months after a single cycle of 2-CdA. Biopsies performed 3 months posttherapy and annually thereafter were examined by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and IHC using the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) anti-CD45RO, anti-CD20, and DBA.44. At 3 months after therapy, 5 of 39 (13%) patients had MRD detectable by IHC that was not evident by routine H&E staining. Two of the five patients (40%) with MRD at 3 months have relapsed, whereas only 2 of 27 (7%) patients with no MRD and at least 1 year of follow up relapsed (P = .11). Over the 3-year follow-up period, two additional patients developed MRD. Overall, three of six (50%) patients with MRD detected at any time after therapy have relapsed, whereas only 1 of 25 (4%) patients without MRD has relapsed (P = .016).

We sought to establish the relationship between BCR-ABL transcript numbers measured by competitive 2-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cytogenetic status in CML patients treated with IFN-alpha. A total of 250 peripheral blood and 55 bone marrow samples with 127 Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and 6 Ph-/BCR-ABL+ CML patients were investigated. Twenty-one patients were studied at diagnosis with IFN-alpha, 24 had a complete cytogenetic response, 21 a partial response, 12 a minor response, 26 no response, and 23 were unknown. Using nested RT-PCR, all 305 samples were positive for BCR-ABL transcripts. To standardize results for variability in RNA and cDNA quantity and quality, we quantified total ABL transcripts in each sample as internal control. The validity of ABL as internal control was shown by comparison with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript levels in 145 samples. The median BCR-ABL transcript numbers (and BCR-ABL/ABL ratios expressed as percentages) were 400/micrograms RNA (O.04%) in complete responders, 20,500/micrograms RNA (7.1%) in partial responders, 170,000/micrograms RNA (21.0%) in minor responders, and 430,000/micrograms RNA (58.7%) in nonresponders (P < .001). The cytogenetic results correlated with the BCR-ABL transcript numbers (r = .82; P < .001) and BCR-ABL/ABL ratios (r = .84; P < .001). Grouping the ratios BCR-ABL/ABL as less than 2%, 2% to 14% and greater than 14% to compare with cytogenetic complete response, partial response, and minor/nonresponse, the concordance between the two methods was 82% (chi2 P< .0001).

In this report, we show that irradiated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice can be transplanted with both normal (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-negative) and neoplastic (Ph+) cells from CML patients with either chronic or blast phase disease. Mice transplanted with peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) cells from 9 of 12 chronic phase CML patients were well engrafted with human cells including multilineage colony-forming progenitors and CD34+ cells for at least 90 days posttransplantation. Repeated posttransplant injections of cytokines did not enhance the number of engrafted human cells. Interestingly, approximately 70% of the human progenitors found in the engrafted SCID BM were Ph-, suggesting that the growth of primitive normal cells is favored in this in vivo transplant model. A similar number of normal cells were found in mice transplanted with either PB or BM cells, suggesting that elevated numbers of primitive normal cells are present in CML PB. When cells from patients with CML in either myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis were transplanted into SCID mice, the BM of these mice was more rapidly repopulated and to a higher level than that observed with transplants of chronic phase cells. Moreover, all human colony-forming progenitors present in the BM of mice transplanted with blast crisis cells were Ph+, and the majority of cells showed the same morphological features of the blast crisis cells originally transplanted. These experiments provide a starting point for the creation of an animal model of CML and establish the feasibility of using this model for the future characterization of transplantable CML stem cells during disease progression.","['Sirard, C', 'Lapidot, T', 'Vormoor, J', 'Cashman, J D', 'Doedens, M', 'Murdoch, B', 'Jamal, N', 'Messner, H', 'Addey, L', 'Minden, M', 'Laraya, P', 'Keating, A', 'Eaves, A', 'Lansdorp, P M', 'Eaves, C J', 'Dick, J E']","['Sirard C', 'Lapidot T', 'Vormoor J', 'Cashman JD', 'Doedens M', 'Murdoch B', 'Jamal N', 'Messner H', 'Addey L', 'Minden M', 'Laraya P', 'Keating A', 'Eaves A', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Eaves CJ', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Radiation Chimera']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68626-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1539-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence was determined by screening of 170 consecutive children with first bone marrow relapse of ALL using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and comparison, with cytogenetic analysis. Among these 170 children, 20 (12%) were found to be BCR-ABL-positive, representing a rate that is about three times higher than that reported for newly diagnosed ALL. Ten of the cases were identified by RT-PCR only. In none of the 21 patients with T-cell immunophenotypes could an expression of the BCR-ABL mRNA be detected. BCR-ABL positivity was associated with a significantly shorter duration of first remission (P = .0086) and higher white blood cell (P = .0157) and blast cell counts (P = .0304) at relapse diagnosis. All patients were treated according to the ALL-REZ BFM 87 and 90 relapse trials of the BFM Relapse Study Group. The intensive multiagent chemotherapy induced a second complete remission in only 60% of children with BCR-ABL-positive ALL compared with in 91% of those without BCR-ABL expression (P = .0023). The prognosis of BCR-ABL-positive ALL in children is poor, with a probability of event-free survival at 2 years of 8% versus 50% in those without BCR-ABL mRNA or cytogenetic analysis should become part of the routine diagnostic panel for children with newly diagnosed ALL and is fundamental for children presenting with an early bone marrow relapse.","['Beyermann, B', 'Agthe, A G', 'Adams, H P', 'Seeger, K', 'Linderkamp, C', 'Goetze, G', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Henze, G']","['Beyermann B', 'Agthe AG', 'Adams HP', 'Seeger K', 'Linderkamp C', 'Goetze G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatrics II, Rudolf-Virchow Klinikum, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68625-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1532-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, APL cells express PML-RAR, an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha (RAR alpha) derived from the leukemia-specific t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. We show here that AM580, a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a RAR alpha agonist, is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in NB4, an APL-derived cell line, and in freshly isolated APL blasts. After treatment of APL cells with AM580 either alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the compound induces granulocytic maturation, as assessed by determination of the levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, CD11b, CD33, and G-CSF receptor mRNA, at concentrations that are 10- to 100-fold lower than those of ATRA necessary to produce similar effects. By contrast, AM580 is not effective as ATRA in modulating the expression of these differentiation markers in the HL-60 cell line and in freshly isolated granulocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients during the stable phase of the disease. In NB4 cells, two other synthetic nonselective RAR ligands are capable of inducing LAP as much as AM580, whereas RAR beta- or RAR gamma-specific ligands are totally ineffective. These results show that AM580 is more powerful than ATRA in modulating the expression of differentiation antigens only in cells in which PML-RAR is present. Binding experiments, using COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PML-RAR and the normal RAR alpha, show that AM580 has a lower affinity than ATRA for both receptors. However, in the presence of PML-RAR, the synthetic retinoid is a much better transactivator of retinoic acid-responsive element-containing promoters than the natural retinoid, whereas, in the presence of RAR alpha, AM580 and ATRA have similar activity.

Using Southern blot analysis, a BCL1 breakpoint can be detected in approximately 50% of MCLs. It is not known whether other MCLs harbor also breakpoints at 11q13. Breakpoints in this region not involved in t(11;14), are detected in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. To detect and localize breakpoints at 11q13 more accurately, we have developed fluorescence in situ hybridization using two probe sets of differently labeled cosmids, symmetrically localized at either side of the major translocation cluster of BCL1. These probes span a region of 450 to 750 kb. We applied this assay to a series of hematologic malignancies with 11q13 abnormalities identified by classical cytogenetics. All four samples with a t(11;14) (q13;q32) showed dissociation of the differently colored signals in metaphase and interphase cells, thereby indicating a chromosomal break in the region defined by the probe sets. The frequency of abnormal metaphase and interphase cells was comparable with that observed in any of the 13 malignancies with other chromosomal 11q13 abnormalities, indicating that these chromosomal breaks occurred outside the 450- to 750-kb region covered by the probes. One patient showed triplication and one patient showed monoallelic loss of this region. The current data show that double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization is a simple and reliable method for detection of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) in interphase cell nuclei and that is can be used to distinguish this translocation from other 11q13 rearrangements in hematologic malignancies.","['Coignet, L J', 'Schuuring, E', 'Kibbelaar, R E', 'Raap, T K', 'Kleiverda, K K', 'Bertheas, M F', 'Wiegant, J', 'Beverstock, G', 'Kluin, P M']","['Coignet LJ', 'Schuuring E', 'Kibbelaar RE', 'Raap TK', 'Kleiverda KK', 'Bertheas MF', 'Wiegant J', 'Beverstock G', 'Kluin PM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cosmids', 'Cyclin D1', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68623-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1512-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Missense or nonsense mutations in the Epo receptor (Epo-R) have been recently described in experimental erythroleukemia in mice and in cases of erythrocytosis in humans. To search for a similar genetic alteration in erythroleukemia and PV, we entirely sequenced the exons of the Epo-R gene as well as the intron-exon junctions in these disorders using polymerase chain reaction. In 1 of 10 cases of erythroleukemia, a single allele mutation was found in the 8th Epo-R gene exon that changed asparagine 487 into a serine. No Epo-r gene mutation was found in 12 PV cases studied, but the same mutation (N487S) was found in 1 patient with polycythemia that did not fulfill the criteria of PV (polycythemia of unknown origin). We did not detect this mutation after sequencing part of the 8th exon of the Epo-R gene from 21 other patients with polycythemia of unknown origin and 51 normal controls. The Epo-R mutation was also found in Epstein-Barr virus-derived cell lines from both cases, suggesting that it is not related to the malignant clone. Therefore, this mutation does not appear to be somatic, although no familial cases were found. The biologic effect of this mutation was subsequently studied. Erythroid progenitors from the polycythemic patient normally responded to Epo, whereas those from the erythroleukemic patient were Epo-independent due to autocrine stimulation by Epo. The normal and the mutated Epo-R were transfected into the murine Ba/F3 cell line. Both types of cells displayed the same response to Epo for proliferation, differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Although this mutation may destroy a consensus binding site for Grb2, no obvious differences either in the pattern of Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylated proteins or in the binding of Grb2 to the Epo-R were observed. In conclusion, a somatic Epo-R missense mutation does not appear to be a molecular mechanism involved in the abnormal growth of human erythroleukemia and PV. However, the Epo-R mutation (N487S) that we describe is located in the same tyrosine sequence beginning at AA 485 as the one previously observed (P488S) in as case of polycythemia (Sokol et al, Exp Hematol 22:447, 1994). These results suggest that this phosphopeptide sequence may play an important role in Epo signalling.","['Le Couedic, J P', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Villeval, J L', 'Feger, F', 'Gobert, S', 'Mayeux, P', 'Casadevall, N', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Le Couedic JP', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Villeval JL', 'Feger F', 'Gobert S', 'Mayeux P', 'Casadevall N', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U 362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68622-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1502-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone destruction in multiple myeloma is due to increased osteoclast (OCL) activity and decreased bone formation in areas of bone adjacent to myeloma cells. The mechanisms underlying osteolysis in multiple myeloma in vivo are unclear. We used a human plasma cell leukemia cell line, ARH-77, that has disseminated growth in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and expresses IgG kappa, as a model for human multiple myeloma, SCID mice were irradiated with 400 rads and mice were injected either with 10(6) ARH-77 cells intravenously (ARH-77 mice) or vehicle 24 hours after irradiation. Development of bone disease was assessed by blood ionized calcium levels, x-rays, and histology. All ARH-77, but none of control mice that survived irradiation, developed hind limb paralysis 28 to 35 days after injection and developed hypercalcemia (1.35 to 1.46 mmol/L) a mean of 5 days after becoming paraplegic. Lytic bone lesions were detected using x-rays in all the hypercalcemic mice examined. No lytic lesions or hypercalcemia developed in the controls. Controls or ARH-77 mice, after developing hypercalcemia, were then killed and bone marrow plasma from the long bones were obtained, concentrated, and assayed for bone-resorbing activity. Bone marrow plasma from ARH-77 mice induced significant bone resorption in the fetal rat long bone resorption assay when compared with controls (percentage of total 45Ca released = 35% +/- 4% v 11% +/- 1%). Histologic examination of tissues from the ARH-77 mice showed infiltration of myeloma cells in the liver and spleen and marked infiltration in vertebrae and long bones, with loss of bony trabeculae and increased OCL numbers. Interestingly, cultures of ARH-77 mouse bone marrow for early OCL precursors (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM]) showed a threefold increase in CFU-GM from ARH-77 marrow versus controls (185 +/- 32 v 40 +/- 3 per 2 x 10(5) cell plated). Bone-resorbing human and murine cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1 alpha or beta, TGF-alpha, lymphotoxin, and TNF alpha were not significantly increased in ARH-77 mouse sera or marrow plasma, compared with control mice, although ARH-77 cells produce IL-6 and lymphotoxin in vitro. Conditioned media from ARH-77 cells induced significant bone resorption in the fetal rat long bone resorption assay when compared with untreated media (percentage of total 45Ca released = 22% +/- 2% v 11% +/- 1%). This effect was not blocked by anti-IL-6 or antilymphotoxin (percentage of total 45Ca released = 19% +/- 1% and 22% +/- 1%, respectively). Thus, we have developed a model of human multiple myeloma bone disease that should be very useful to dissect the pathogenesis of the bone destruction in multiple myeloma.","['Alsina, M', 'Boyce, B', 'Devlin, R D', 'Anderson, J L', 'Craig, F', 'Mundy, G R', 'Roodman, G D']","['Alsina M', 'Boyce B', 'Devlin RD', 'Anderson JL', 'Craig F', 'Mundy GR', 'Roodman GD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Diseases/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Resorption', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteoclasts/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68621-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1495-501.,,,,"['AM35188/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA01723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited information is available concerning the effects of growth factors in AML patients. To examine the in vivo effects of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on AML cells, laboratory studies were performed before and after a 72-hour intravenous infusion of G-CSF (10 micrograms/kg/d) administered to 28 untreated AML patients. Twenty-seven patients (96%) showed increases in at least one of the following parameters after G-CSF: blood blasts, bone marrow (BM) blasts, leukemia cells in S phase or interphase cells with leukemia-specific markers shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The median paired change in absolute blast count was +2.7 x 10(9)/L (P = .0001) after G-CSF, as compared with 0.0 during the 72 hours before initiation of G-CSF. The median percentage of BM leukemia cells in S phase increased from 6.0% to 10.7% after G-CSF (median change, %5.9%; P = .009). Interphase BM cells with trisomy 8 or monosomy 7 increased in 6 of 6 patients with these abnormalities (P = .02) with a median percent increase of 47%. Blood neutrophil counts also increased during G-CSF (median paired change, +2.8 x 10(9)/L; P < .0001). Trisomy 8 or monosomy 7 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization in post-G-CSF blood neutrophils from 4 of 6 patients but was also present in neutrophils before G-CSF.

Most neoplasms arising from this T-cell subpopulation have been a chronic lymphoproliferative disease referred to as T-large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Only 10 NK-like T-cell lymphomas have been described in detail previously; this study presents the clinicopathologic features of six others and distinguishes these lymphomas from T-LGL leukemia. All patients presented with B-symptoms and often had marked hepatosplenomegaly without significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. Four of the six patients were immunosuppressed. All had CD3, CD8, CD56-positive tumors, presumably of hepatosplenic (n = 3), intestinal (n = 1), pulmonary (n = 1), or nodal (n = 1) origin. Three patients had lymphomatous bone marrow infiltrates, and four had peripheral blood involvement by neoplastic large lymphocytes, some of which had a blastic appearance or resembled virocytes. Azurophilic granules, ultrastructurally corresponding to cytoplasmic dense core and/or double density granules, were seen in all cases. T-cell clonality was shown in five tumors by Southern blot analysis, and three had abnormal karyotypes. Two untreated patients died 20 days after presentation, and three patients who received combination chemotherapy died within 5 months of presentation. One patient remains in complete remission 22 months after treatment. These findings suggest NK-like T-cell lymphomas are aggressive, are clinicopathologically distinct from T-LGL leukemia, and should be in the differential diagnosis of extranodal T-cell lymphoproliferations, including those in immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, the LGL morphology, phenotype, and tissue distribution of some NK-like T-cell lymphomas suggest they arise from thymic-independent T cells of the hepatic sinusoids and intestinal mucosa.","['Macon, W R', 'Williams, M E', 'Greer, J P', 'Hammer, R D', 'Glick, A D', 'Collins, R D', 'Cousar, J B']","['Macon WR', 'Williams ME', 'Greer JP', 'Hammer RD', 'Glick AD', 'Collins RD', 'Cousar JB']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68619-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1474-83.,['Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1207-10.

To analyze Vav function in adult blood cell formation, we used antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) to disrupt its expression in normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells. Bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were obtained from consenting normal donors and patients with acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia (AML and CML, respectively) and polycythemia vera (PV). Adherent and T-cell-depleted (A-T-) MNC or CD34+ MNC were exposed to unmodified sense, antisense, or scrambled sequence ODN corresponding to codons 2-7 of Vav's mRNA sequence. Cells were then assayed for Vav mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Vav protein expression by Western binding. After showing that Vav-targeted AS ODN could specifically diminish Vav mRNA and protein expression, we assessed the ability of Vav-deficient cells to form myeloid and erythroid colonies in methyl-cellulose cultures. When normal CD34+ MNC were exposed to Vav AS ODN, no effect on colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) or CFU-megakaryocyte colony formation was observed. In contrast erythroid colony growth was inhibited by a mean +/- SD of 62% +/- 16%. In patients with hematopoietic malignancies. Vav-targeted AS ODN inhibited CFU-GM colony formation in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner in 1 of 3 AML, 13 of 17 CML, and 2 of 2 PV patients. At the highest concentration used, the Vav AS ODN inhibited CFU-GM colony formation from 66% to 81% when compared with control cell colony growth. Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony-formation was also assessed in 7 PV patients. The Vav-targeted AS ODN inhibited BFU-E colony formation in all by a mean +/- SD of 81% +/- 4%. These findings suggest that Vav function may not be easily complemented in a significant subset of normal adult erythroid progenitor cells and may also be necessary for myeloid progenitor cell growth in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Luger, S M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z', 'Kuczynski, W I', 'DiPaola, R S', 'Ngo, W', 'Clevenger, C V', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Luger SM', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Kuczynski WI', 'DiPaola RS', 'Ngo W', 'Clevenger CV', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68602-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1326-34.,,,,"['AI 33510/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 54384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grade II acute GVHD developed in 1 patient at level I and 1 at level III. The maximum tolerated dose of induction IL-2 was level II. IL-2 induced lymphocytosis, with an increase in CD56+ and CD8+ cells. Ten patients remain in CR at 5+ to 67+ months. Thus, a regimen of IL-2 has been identified that did not induce a high incidence of acute GVHD when administered to children after unmodified allogeneic BMT. Its clinical activity will be assessed in a phase II trial.","['Robinson, N', 'Sanders, J E', 'Benyunes, M C', 'Beach, K', 'Lindgren, C', 'Thompson, J A', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Fefer, A']","['Robinson N', 'Sanders JE', 'Benyunes MC', 'Beach K', 'Lindgren C', 'Thompson JA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Fefer A']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage', 'Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68593-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 15;87(4):1249-54.,,,,['P01 CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cell cultivation in agarose with feeder layers appeared inferior to that performed in agarose with recombinant human granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor and methylcellulose with phytohaemaglutinin leukocyte-conditioned medium. Since the transplant cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen between harvesting and reinfusion, the following samples were tested: buffy coat cells, buffy coat cells immediately after addition of dimethylsulphoxide, cell sample that had been frozen for 24 hours, and frozen transplant cells at the time of thawing and transplantation. Each procedural step decreased both cell viability and the number of CFU-GM, but since the lymphohaematologic recovery in all patients followed the pattern reported in the literature for high-quality transplants, we concluded that our transplants retained the necessary number of progenitor cells. It appears that the best strategy for dynamic assessment of the transplant quality would be to perform tests after every step of the transplant processing.

We synthesized a baculovirus transfer vector with the polyhedrin promoter followed sequentially from the 5' end with DNA encoding the gp67A leader sequence, the tripeptide ADP, IL2, another ADP tripeptide, and RTB. Recombinant baculovirus was generated in Sf9 insect cells and used to infect Sf9 cells. Recombinant IL2-RTB protein was recovered at high yields from day 5 insect cell supernatants, partially purified by affinity chromatography, and characterized. The recombinant product was soluble and immunoreactive with antibodies to RTB and IL2, bound asialofetuin and lactose, and reassociated with RTA. In the presence of lactose to block galactose-binding sites on RTB, the IL2-RTB-RTA heterodimer was selectively cytotoxic to IL2 receptor, bearing cells.

The prognosis remains poor for most children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Total body irradiation (TBI) chimeras were induced by infusing 5 x 1O(6) T cell depleted syngeneic AKR BM cells together with 15 x 1O(6) non T cell depleted allogeneic C3H BM cells 1 day after a single fraction of 10.5 Gy TBI.

In both groups, clonal deletion of antihost-reactive donor type T lymphocytes was found. Whereas TBI chimeras did resist rejection by host type splenocytes injected 2 months after transplantation, TLI chimeras did not. As the latter phenomenon is believed to reflect remaining GVHR, TLI chimeras did have a lower remaining GVHD capacity than TBI chimeras. Nevertheless, TLI chimeras survived significantly longer after host type leukemia challenge (injection of 6 x 10(6) AKR lymphoma cells). The better survival of the TLI chimeras was not due to the radiation regimen, because TLI or TBI conditioned syngeneic AKR-->AKR BM recipients did succumb equally rapidly after AKR lymphoma injection. Donor type (CM) lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, however, was higher in TLI chimeras and may explain the better GVL activity in TLI mice. This model thus illustrates that GVHD and GVL effects can be dissociated and are differentially influenced by the conditioning regimen used for BM transplantation.","['Salam, A', 'Waer, M']","['Salam A', 'Waer M']","['Laboratory for Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chimera', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199603150-00025 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1996 Mar 15;61(5):826-30. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199603150-00025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, alterations in the DNA sequence of a gene involved in cell proliferation can have a significant effect on the viability of particular cells, Thus, the capacity to modulate the base sequence of such a gene would be a useful tool for cancer therapeutics. We have developed an experimental strategy that centers around site-specific DNA base mutation or correction using a unique chimeric oligonucleotide. This chimeric molecule has demonstrated higher recombinogenic activities than identical oligonucleotides containing only DNA residues, both in vitro and in vivo. The chimeric molecule is designed to hybridize to a target site within the genome and induce a single base mismatch at the residue targeted for mutation. The DNA structure created at this site is recognized by the host cell's repair system which mediates the correction reaction. The bcr-abl fusion gene, the product of a translocation between human chromosomes 9 and 22, and the cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can be targeted for gene correction. This fusion gene is a good choice because (1) it is a unique target in CML; (2) it is a single copy target; (3) the DNA sequence of the fusion gene is unique.

The ability of DNA loops to undergo changes in supercoiling in the presence of radiation-induced damage revealed that in all cases the degree of inhibition of supercoil rewinding was greater in the radiosensitive cells. Since the amount of DNA damage induced per unit dose is known to be equal in all these cell lines, the same number of DNA lesions produced a greater loss of topological constraint in the radiosensitive cells. The differential loss of DNA supercoiling ability could be due to differences in DNA-nuclear matrix anchor points. High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of nucleoid proteins showed numerous reproducible differences in nuclear matrix protein between the cell lines studied. A total of nine proteins were associated with nucleoids from L5178Y-R cells and absent from L5178Y-S nucleoids. None of them, however, correlated absolutely with radioresistance. Thus, unlike previous studies in CHO cells, no candidates for the conveyance of cellular radiosensitivity that were single proteins were detected. However, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that stability of DNA loop domains in the presence of DNA damage is a determinant of the outcome of radiation-induced DNA damage.","['Malyapa, R S', 'Wright, W D', 'Roti Roti, J L']","['Malyapa RS', 'Wright WD', 'Roti Roti JL']","['Section of Cancer Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Superhelical/*radiation effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1996 Feb;145(2):239-42.,,,,['CA51116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural history and sequelae of treatment.,77-8,"To define further the natural history of treated Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital anemia characterized by a paucity of erythroid precursors, we analyzed 76 patients diagnosed or followed at Children's Hospital, Boston, between 1931 and 1992. Although DBA is generally defined as macrocytic, we found that mean corpuscular volume in infants aged <5 months rarely exceeded the normal range and is of little diagnostic value. Macrocytosis in patients aged > or = 5 months was more striking. Nine of 16 patients who never received steroids experienced remissions, sometimes after years of transfusions. Thirty-one of 56 patients receiving corticosteroids responded. Of these 31, 13 experienced remissions, 11 remained steroid dependent and 7 later required transfusions. Most nonresponders maintained transfusion dependence. Patients frequently (64%) experienced treatment-related morbidity, most commonly hemosiderosis. The relative risk of leukemia was profoundly elevated (RR, 200; 95% CI, 54.5-512.1) and hematologic parameters at long-term follow-up were often abnormal. While potential responsiveness to steroids and relative ease of red cell transfusion make DBA one of the most treatable congenital marrow failure syndromes, both disease-related and treatment-related factors contributed to a limited prognosis (median survival, 38 years). Patients should be carefully monitored longitudinally for evidence of leukemia and adverse effects of therapy, and alternative treatment strategies should be considered on an individual basis.","['Janov, A J', 'Leong, T', 'Nathan, D G', 'Guinan, E C']","['Janov AJ', 'Leong T', 'Nathan DG', 'Guinan EC']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Control, Dana Farber Cancer Institute Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Fanconi Anemia/complications/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-199603000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1996 Mar;75(2):77-8. doi: 10.1097/00005792-199603000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While human OSM has been characterized and the bovine OSM gene was recently cloned, the murine counterpart had not been identified. Here we describe molecular cloning of murine OSM as an immediate early gene induced by a subset of cytokines including IL2, IL3 and erythropoietin (EPO) in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. The induction kinetics of OSM are rapid and transient, reaching a maximal level within 30-60 min and decreasing thereafter. Induction of OSM depends on the signals generated by the membrane-proximal region of the EPO receptor as well as that of the beta chain of the IL3/GM-CSF receptor, which activate JAK2 and STAT5. About 100 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site of the OSM gene contains a possible STAT5 binding site which is essential for IL2, IL3 and EPO-dependent promoter activity of the OSM gene. Expression of STAT5 and the EPO receptor in COS cells conferred EPO-dependent activation of the OSM promoter. Moreover, the mutant IL2 receptor lacking the ability to activate STAT5 induced c-myc but failed to induce OSM. Thus OSM is one of the common targets of a subset of cytokines that activate STAT5. The murine OSM gene is located near to the LIF gene, expressed at high levels in bone marrow and possesses similar biological activity to human OSM. Identification of murine OSM as a cytokine-inducible immediate early gene provides a new insight into the physiological function of this unique cytokine.","['Yoshimura, A', 'Ichihara, M', 'Kinjyo, I', 'Moriyama, M', 'Copeland, N G', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Hara, T', 'Miyajima, A']","['Yoshimura A', 'Ichihara M', 'Kinjyo I', 'Moriyama M', 'Copeland NG', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Hara T', 'Miyajima A']","['Institute of Life Science, Kurame University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, Immediate-Early/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Mar 1;15(5):1055-63.,,,,['N01-CO-46000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC450003,,['GENBANK/D31942'],,,,,,,,,,

Some T cell leukaemia patients have chromosomal abnormalities involving both genes, implying that LMO2 and TAL1 act synergistically to promote tumorigenesis after their inappropriate co-expression. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice were made which co-express Lmo2 and Tal1 genes in T cells. Dimers of Lmo2 and Tal1 proteins were formed in thymocytes of double but not single transgenic mice. Furthermore, thymuses of double transgenic mice were almost completely populated by immature T cells from birth, and these mice develop T cell tumours approximately 3 months earlier than those with only the Lmo2 transgene. Thus interaction between these two proteins can alter T cell development and potentiate tumorigenesis.

An epidemiological association between the abdominal exposure of pregnant women to diagnostic X-rays and childhood cancer was first reported in the 1950s, while an association between the recorded dose of radiation received occupationally by fathers before the conception of their offspring and childhood leukemia was reported only recently in 1990. The scientific interpretation of these particular statistical associations is by no means straightforward, but the latest analyses of intrauterine irradiation and childhood cancer indicate that a causal inference is likely. Scientific committees have adopted risk coefficients for the intrauterine exposure of somatic tissues, which for childhood leukemia are comparable to those accepted for exposure in infancy, although questions remain about the level of risk of childhood solid tumors imparted by exposure to radiation in utero and shortly after birth. In contrast, the association between paternal preconceptional radiation dose and childhood leukemia has not been confirmed by studies using objectively determined doses. The original association has been found to be restricted to children born in one village, it does not extend to cancers other than leukemia, and it is markedly inconsistent with the established body of knowledge on radiation-induced hereditary disease.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used used 24 hours after chemotherapy until absolute neutrophile count greater than 500/mm3. RESULTS: Totally 24 courses of high dose chemotherapy were given. The median duration of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophile count < or = 500/mm3) was 12 days, thrombocytopenia (< or = 50,000/mm3) 18 days, fever > or = 38 degrees C 6 days, and from severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophile count < or = 500/mm3) was 12 days, thrombocytopenia (< or = 50,000/mm3) 18 days, fever > or = 38 degrees C 6 days, and from severe neutropenia (< or = 500/mm3) to infection 4 days. Infection was the most frequent complication during HiDAC treatment. No toxic death was noted. After a median follow-up of 16 months, early relapse was noted in 3 patients (2, 4, and 5 months, respectively), and late relapse in two patients (11 and 20 months, respectively). Seven patients remained in complete remission status after a median follow-up of 14+ months (7+ to 37+ months). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive consolidation chemotherapy is well tolerable and may prolong remission duration when used in the early post-remission phase of AML.","['Hsu, H C', 'Chiu, C F', 'Tan, T D', 'Chau, W K', 'Tseng, C S', 'Ho, C H']","['Hsu HC', 'Chiu CF', 'Tan TD', 'Chau WK', 'Tseng CS', 'Ho CH']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Remission Induction']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1995 Nov;56(5):305-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The megakaryocytic predominance may be so striking that differentiation from other chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) may be difficult in some CML patients. Megakaryocytes in CML are clonal as demonstrated by loss of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. The Ph translocation, fusing the abl and bcr genes on chromosomes 9 and 22, however, obviously occurs as a second step in tumour development. So far, the Ph translocation has not been assigned explicitly to megakaryocytes. The question is whether the megakaryocytic cell lineage could harbour the bcr/abl fusion in those CML cases with striking proliferation of megakaryocytes but lack this genetic defect in cases with normal or decreased megakaryocyte counts. We therefore performed triple-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for portions of the bcr and abl genes flanking the breakpoint in CML in paraffin sections of CML cases with normal and with increased numbers of megakaryocytes. This method allows identification of the bcr/abl fusion in single, morphologically intact cells, whereas conventional cytogenetics requires lysis and thus destruction of the cell. Among the 21 CML patients examined by FISH, 10 were informative for bcr and abl genes and displayed distinct hybridization signals within nuclei of bone marrow cells. Besides the granulopoietic cells, megakaryocytes of all those patients (4 without and 6 with varying grades of megakaryocytic increase) displayed bcr/abl fusion signals indicative of a Ph translocation. The lack of hybridization signals in the remaining 11 cases indicates that this technique is not of value diagnostically and should be reserved for scientific questions. Positive controls consisted of conventional chromosome preparations from bone marrow aspirates demonstrating the Ph chromosome in all patients examined, and negative controls of paraffin sections of bone marrow biopsies from non-CML patients. These showed no fusion signals in bone marrow cells, including megakaryocytes, using FISH. Our results demonstrate clearly that not only the transforming event but also the Ph translocation leading to the bcr/abl fusion happens prior to the differentiation of the pluripotent stem cell into different myeloid lineages. The megakaryocytic proliferation evident in some CML cases is probably a consequence of the disease progress.","['Nolte, M', 'Werner, M', 'Ewig, M', 'von Wasielewski, R', 'Link, H', 'Diedrich, H', 'Georgii, A']","['Nolte M', 'Werner M', 'Ewig M', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Link H', 'Diedrich H', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*chemistry/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00202886 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 1996 Mar;427(6):561-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00202886.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to obtain first estimates of the safety and efficacy of FK506 monotherapy in the prevention of GVHD following HLA-identical sibling marrow transplantation. Additionally, a subset of patients was studied to define the pharmacokinetic profile of FK506. Twenty-seven adult patients with leukemia or myelodysplasia received FK506 starting the day before transplant at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/d by continuous intravenous infusion. When clinically possible, FK506 was given orally in two divided doses starting at five times the daily intravenous dose. FK506 doses were adjusted to target a steady state or trough blood level between 10 to 30 ng/mL. These patients were followed for 6 months posttransplant. All patients had sustained marrow engraftment. Frequently noted adverse events included reversible renal dysfunction, diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Most patients required FK506 dose reductions associated with elevated serum creatinine. Two (7%) patients relapsed, one of whom died of the disease within the 6-month study period. A second patient died due to pulmonary mucor. Whole blood pharmacokinetic parameters indicated a half-life of 18.2 +/- 12.1 hours; volume of distribution of 1.67 +/- 1.02 L/kg; clearance of 71 +/- 34 mL/h/kg; and bioavailability of 32 +/- 24%. Eleven of 27 (41%) patients developed grade II to IV acute GVHD, including 10 grade II and one grade III. Six of 24 (25%) evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD. These data indicate that FK506 monotherapy has activity in preventing GVHD.

To analyze the mechanisms that lead to the expression of IL-1alpha in HTLV-I-infected cell lines, we studied regulatory regions of the human IL-1alpha promoter involved in activation of the IL-1alpha gene. IL-1alpha promoter constructs drive transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in HTLV-I-positive MT-2 cells, which constitutively produce IL-1alpha. In a cotransfection assay, the Tax protein of both HTLV-I and HTLV-II specifically activated transcription from the IL-1alpha promoter in an uninfected Jurkat cell line. A mutant Tax protein deficient in transactivation of genes by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway was unable to induce transcriptional activity of IL-1alpha promoter-CAT constructs, but was rescued by exogenous provision of p65/p50 NF-kappaB. We found that two IL-1alpha kappaB-like sites (positions -1,065 to -1,056 and +646 to +655) specifically formed a complex with NF-kappaB-containing nuclear extract from MT-2 cells and that NF-kappaB bound with higher affinity to the 3' NF-kappaB binding site than to the 5' NF-kappaB site. Moreover, deletion of either 5' or 3' NF-kappaB sites reduced IL-1alpha promoter activity in MT-2 cells and transactivation of the IL-1alpha promoter by exogenous NF-kappaB and Tax in Jurkat cells. These data suggest a general role for Tax induction of IL-1alpha gene transcription by the NF-kappaB pathway. Expression of IL-1alpha by HTLV-I productively infected cells may be important in the hypercalcemia, osteolytic bone lesions, neutrophilia, elevation of C-reactive protein, and fever frequently seen in patients with HTLV-I-induced adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['Mori, N', 'Prager, D']","['Mori N', 'Prager D']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles CA, 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Resorption/etiology', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/etiology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64747-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3410-7.,,,,['R01 DK46484/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB4 (1 x 10(6) cells) were transplanted into the peritoneum (IP) of SCID mice for 1 month.

Furthermore, A-NB4 cells were capable of differentiating when treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), as manifested by enhanced NBT reduction and CD11b expression. In vivo treatment with ATRA in SCID mice for 4 days also increased NBT reduction by A-NB4 cells. ATRA treatment significantly prolonged survival time in the group after transplantation (28.1 +/- 6.8 to 29.1 +/- 8.4 days) compared with the control (P < .001). Furthermore, treatment with adriamycin, an effective chemotherapeutic drug in APL, had a strong growth suppressive effect on A-NB4 cells.

Sensitivity and metabolism of ara-C was examined in myeloblasts from DS and non-DS patients with AML, DS infants with the transient myeloproliferative disorder, and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines with and without trisomy 21. DS myeloblasts were approximately 10-fold more sensitive to ara-C (measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric sensitivity assay), compared with non-DS myeloblasts, following exposure to ara-C for 72 hours. Mean levels of l-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) were significantly higher in DS myeloblasts compared with non-DS myeloblasts after incubation with 5 micromol/L ara-C (621.4 v 228.4 pmol/mg protein). DS cell lines also generated higher levels of ara-CTP compared with cell lines with diploid chromosome numbers (66.5 v 13.6 pmol/mg protein and 137.6 v 41.7 pmol/mg protein at 1 and 5 micromol/L ara-C, respectively). Elevated ara-CTP levels in the DS cells were accompanied by slightly lower levels of endogenous deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pools, slightly greater extent of ara-C incorporation into DNA, and increased relative numbers of double strand DNA strand breaks. There were no significant differences in the cell cycle distributions of DS and non-DS cells. These in vitro studies support our hypothesis that enhanced metabolism of ara-C in DS cells may be a contributing factor to the superior survival rate of DS children with AML and is possibly based on a gene dosage effect of genes localized to chromosome 21 including cystathionine-beta-synthase. Further study of the mechanisms (ie, alterations in dCTP pools and DNA methylation) involved may lead to improvements in the treatment of all AML patients.","['Taub, J W', 'Matherly, L H', 'Stout, M L', 'Buck, S A', 'Gurney, J G', 'Ravindranath, Y']","['Taub JW', 'Matherly LH', 'Stout ML', 'Buck SA', 'Gurney JG', 'Ravindranath Y']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit 48201, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'EC 4.2.1.22 (Cystathionine beta-Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Homocysteine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Survival Rate']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64745-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3395-403.,,,,['CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, it enhanced the differentiation of human myelomonocytic ML-1, THP-1, P39/TSU, and P31/FUJ cells induced by VD3. In combination with VD3, it synergistically inhibited the proliferation of HL-60, U937, ML-1, THP-1, P39/TSU, and P31/FUJ cells and decreased the effective concentration of VD3 to a 10(-10) mol/L level. Because tretinoin tocoferil was reported to induce neither retinoid-related toxicity nor teratogenicity, the therapeutic advantage of the use of it in treatment of myelomonocytic leukemia is suggested.","['Makishima, M', 'Kanatani, Y', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Honma, Y']","['Makishima M', 'Kanatani Y', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitoma Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina-machi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CTD060B1SS (tocoretinate)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64744-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3384-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alterations include deletions that are thought to be indicative of the presence of a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated on the remaining allele. To refine further the chromosomal localization of this gene, we analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 12 in 100 primary ALL samples using 22 polymorphic markers and identified two distinct smallest common deleted regions on chromosome 12p13. One region is flanked by D12S77 and D12S98 and has a size of 4 cM. Twenty-six percent of informative patients showed LOH in this region. This region may contain the TEL gene. The other region is flanked by D12S269 and D12S308 including the KIP1 gene. Forty-four percent of informative patients showed LOH in this second region. Mutational analysis of KIP1 using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and Southern blot analysis showed no homozygous deletions and point mutations suggesting that the altered gene in this second region is not the KIP1. Clinical data showed that LOH of 12p was demonstrated more frequently in precursor-B ALLs (32 of 80; 40%) than in T-ALLs (1 of 20; 5%) (P = .0027). Furthermore, patients with 12p LOH were younger (P = .013), with a lower DNA index (P = .046), but they had the same survival rates at 3 years. In summary, these data suggest that two different tumor suppressor genes are on chromosome arm 12p, which act separately in the development of childhood precursor-B ALLs. One of the tumor suppressor genes is in the region the KIP1 gene, but our data suggest this gene is not abnormal. The other target is in the region of the TEL gene; and this candidate deserves further study.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Bartram, C R', 'Miller, C W', 'Reiter, A', 'Seriu, T', 'Zimmerann, M', 'Schrappe, M', 'Mori, N', 'Slater, J', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Takeuchi S', 'Bartram CR', 'Miller CW', 'Reiter A', 'Seriu T', 'Zimmerann M', 'Schrappe M', 'Mori N', 'Slater J', 'Miyoshi I', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64742-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3368-74.,,,,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulation of a protein shown to shorten the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin E, in growth-delayed leukemic blasts may reflect the malignant status of these cells.

In paired B-ALL samples taken before treatment and at relapse, we found a significant overexpression of the 50-kD protein in relapsed samples (P < .006), plus the presence of up to four additional smaller-molecular-weight species of cyclin E, illustrating clear diagnosis versus relapse differences.

As for B lymphocytes, IL-15 has been shown to provide stimulatory activities in normal preactivated B cells that are mainly transduced through IL- 2 receptor (IL-2R) complex components. Since leukemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD) bear IL-2R and grow in response to IL-2, we investigated whether IL-15 triggers the proliferation of malignant B cells obtained from 12 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and five patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Enriched B cells recovered from five healthy subjects were also studied as controls. IL-15 stimulated the proliferation of freshly isolated leukemic B cells, but not resting normal B lymphocytes, the latter being able to grow in the presence of IL-15 only after in vitro preactivation with phorbol myristate acetate. The proliferation elicited by IL-2 on leukemic cells was comparable to that determined by IL-15. Following addition of graded concentrations of IL-15 to low/intermediate-dose IL-2, resting leukemic B cells showed a higher stimulatory rate than that observed using the two cytokines separately. In normal resting B lymphocytes, this cumulative effect was not observed. The role of different IL-2R subunits in IL-15-driven growth of malignant B cells was investigated both by their expression on leukemic cells and by the block of different IL-2R subunits (p55, p75, and p64) with specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Using flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses we demonstrated that both B-CLL and HCL leukemic B cells express the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2R system. The stimulatory activity achieved by IL-15 decreased significantly, blocking the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2R. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-15 triggers the growth of leukemic B cells through IL-2R system subunits, pointing to the role of this novel cytokine in regulating the neoplastic proliferation in CLD.","['Trentin, L', 'Cerutti, A', 'Zambello, R', 'Sancretta, R', 'Tassinari, C', 'Facco, M', 'Adami, F', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Agostini, C', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Cerutti A', 'Zambello R', 'Sancretta R', 'Tassinari C', 'Facco M', 'Adami F', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Agostini C', 'Semenzato G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/chemistry/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64737-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3327-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This indicates that factors responsible for LTC-IC maintenance are present in soluble form in stromal supernatant (SN). Although the picogram concentrations of cytokines present in stromal SN can induce the differentiation of CD34+/HLA-DR- (DR-) cells to clonogenic cells (colony forming cells; CFC), they maintain only 10% of LTC-IC for 5 weeks, suggesting that factors other than these cytokines are required for LTC-IC maintenance. To characterize the factor(s) in stromal SN responsible for LTC-IC maintenance, we purified glycoproteins and proteoglycans (PG) from the SN of the LTC-IC supportive murine marrow stromal fibroblast cell line M2-10B4 by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Culture of DR- cells in a combination of M2-10B4-derived PG, but not glycoproteins and picogram concentrations of recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) resulted in the recovery of 96% +/- 8% of LTC-IC maintained in cultures supplemented with unfractionated stromal SN. LTC-IC maintenance was largely retained after digestion of the PG-rich fraction with proteinase K and after dissociative gel filtration chromatography, but was completely abolished following treatment with nitrous acid, which digests heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS GAG). As for M2-10B4-derived HS GAG, high concentrations of bovine kidney HS GAG, but not bovine tracheal chondroitin sulfate, significantly improved cytokine-mediated LTC-IC maintenance. Maintenance of LTC-IC by these nonmarrow-derived HS GAG was, however, significantly lower than that seen with M2-10B4-derived HS. These studies demonstrate a role for marrow stroma-derived HS GAG in the long-term in vitro maintenance of human LTC-IC. Further structure-function analysis of these HS GAG may have important implications for ex vivo stem cell expansion and gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitors.","['Gupta, P', 'McCarthy, J B', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Gupta P', 'McCarthy JB', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/isolation & purification/pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Connective Tissue/chemistry', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/*chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Heparitin Sulfate/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Proteoglycans/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64726-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3229-36.,,,,"['R01-CA-45814-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-48738-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930-01A2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent proliferation of NFS-60 cells is associated with the induction of a specific calmodulin-binding protein of about 68 kD (CaM-BP68). To evaluate the relationship between proliferative stimulation and the induction of CaM-BP68 by cytokines, we examined whether the increased proliferative potential of NFS-60 cells in response to SCF is reflected in an increased induction of the CaM-BP68. We observed that SCF alone has a limited effect on proliferative stimulation and on the induction of CaM-BP68 in factor-deprived NFS-60 cells. However, when combined with IL-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or IL-6, it caused a significant increase in cytokine-dependent proliferative stimulation, as well as in the induction of CaM-BP68. Furthermore, an increase in IL-3-dependent induction of CaM-BP68 in the presence of SCF coincided with a corresponding increase in thymidine kinase activity, whose expression is linked to G1/S transition of the cells. At low concentrations SCF caused a synergistic increase in IL-3-dependent induction of both CaM-BP68 and thymidine kinase activity. In contrast to the changes in CaM-BP68 and thymidine kinase activity, no significant changes in DNA polymerase alpha were observed in factor-deprived NFS-60 cells in response to IL-3 and/or SCF. These observations suggest an increased expression of CaM-BP68 and thymidine kinase are associated with the synergistic effect of SCF on factor-dependent proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Reddy, G P', 'Quesenberry, P J']","['Reddy GP', 'Quesenberry PJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts, Medical Center, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Polymerase II/analysis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64722-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3195-202.,,,,['CA27466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated PBR function by quantifying this receptor in leukocyte subsets from healthy donors and in leukemic blasts from lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the human PBR and a quantitative flow cytometric assay, we found that phagocytic cells from healthy donors displayed a higher level of PBRs than lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. Among the lymphoid lineage, thymocytes and IgD-negative B cells expressed the lowest levels. However, because of the wide heterogeneity of PBR levels among 42 acute or chronic lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, it was not possible to assign PBR expression to a stage of maturation or a cell lineage. Although the PBR displayed a mitochondrial subcellular localization, its expression was not correlated with the mitochondrial content, suggesting a modulation of PBR density at the level of the mitochondria. This modulation was confirmed when we studied in detail the PBR expression during T-cell development by both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. We found that the PBR was expressed with a bimodal profile during T-cell development, identical to the one observed with the proto-oncogene, Bcl-2. The high similarity in the expression of both the PBR and the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene in T-cell and B-cell subsets, their common mitochondrial localization, and the observation of high quantities of PBR in phagocytic cells, which are known to produce high levels of radical oxygen species, suggested that PBRs may participate in an antioxidant pathway. Indeed, a strong correlation was established between the ability of hematopoietic cell lines to resist H202 cytotoxicity and their level of PBR expression. Demonstration of the role of PBR in the protection against H202 was obtained by transfecting JURKAT cells with the human PBR cDNA. Transfected cells exhibited increased resistance to H202 compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that PBR may prevent mitochondria from radical damages and thereby modulate apoptosis in the hematopoietic system.","['Carayon, P', 'Portier, M', 'Dussossoy, D', 'Bord, A', 'Petitpretre, G', 'Canat, X', 'Le Fur, G', 'Casellas, P']","['Carayon P', 'Portier M', 'Dussossoy D', 'Bord A', 'Petitpretre G', 'Canat X', 'Le Fur G', 'Casellas P']","['Department of Immunology, Sanofi Recherche, Montpelier, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Porphyrins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, GABA-A/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64719-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3170-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group.,3143-50,"Overall chemotherapeutic treatment results in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are good, with event-free survival (EFS) rates over 70%. However, for a subset of patients characterized by high-risk (HR) features the outcome is less favorable, with EFS rates below 50%. Intensification of chemotherapy may improve the outcome for those patients, but increased toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, limits the escalation of dose intensity. Recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) is known to reduce myelosuppression after cancer chemotherapy in adults. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of r-metHuG-CSF on myelosuppression in HR pediatric ALL patients and on the overall response rate to chemotherapy. Patients with HR pediatric ALL were randomized to receive nine alternating cycles of chemotherapy according to the German ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90 protocol either alone or followed by r-metHuG-CSF administered prophylactically at a dose of 5 microg/kg/d subcutaneously. In both groups, the planned interval between chemotherapy courses was a minimum of 21 days. We report here interim results of 34 patients. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <0.5 x 10(9)/L and oral temperature > or = 38.5 degrees C) was 17% in children receiving r-metHuG-CSF, as compared with 40% in the control group (P = .007). In addition, the median total duration of febrile neutropenia was reduced from 20.3 to 6.2 days per patient (P = .02). Culture-confirmed infections occurred less frequently in the r-metHuG-CSF group (8% v 15%; P = .04), and the total duration of intravenous antibiotic use was significantly reduced from 32.2 days to 18.2 days per patient (P = .02). A tighter adherence to the planned treatment schedule was also facilitated by r-metHuG-CSF (P = .007). With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the estimated EFS of 4 years is 41% +/- 12%. In conclusion, r-metHuG-CSF administered prophylactically in the interval between chemotherapy courses significantly reduced febrile neutropenia, culture-confirmed infections, and duration of intravenous antibiotic administration and allowed for tighter adherence to the treatment schedule.","['Welte, K', 'Reiter, A', 'Mempel, K', 'Pfetsch, M', 'Schwab, G', 'Schrappe, M', 'Riehm, H']","['Welte K', 'Reiter A', 'Mempel K', 'Pfetsch M', 'Schwab G', 'Schrappe M', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'HR-1 protocol', 'HR-2 protocol', 'HR-3 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Filgrastim', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infection Control', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64716-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3143-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Collaborative Study of the Group Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique.,3135-42,"Cytogenetic analyses performed at diagnosis on 443 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were reviewed by the Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique, correlated with hematologic data, and compared with findings for childhood ALL. This study showed that the same recurrent abnormalities as those reported in childhood ALL are found in adults, and it determined their frequencies and distribution according to age. Hyperdiploidy greater than 50 chromosomes with a standard pattern of chromosome gains had a lower frequency (7%) than in children, and was associated with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) in 11 of 30 cases. Tetraploidy (2%) and triploidy (3%) were more frequent than that in childhood ALL. Hypodiploidy 30-39 chromosomes (2%), characterized by a specific pattern of chromosome losses, might be related to the triploid group that evoked a duplication of the 30-39 hypodiploidy. Both groups shared similar hematologic features. Ph+ ALL (29%) peaked in the 40- to 50-year-old age range (49%) and showed a high frequency of myeloid antigens (24%). ALL with t(1;19) (3%) occurred in young adults (median age, 22 years). In T-cell ALL (T-ALL), frequencies of 14q11 breakpoints (26%) and of t(10;14)(q24;q11) (14%) were higher than those in childhood ALL. New recurrent changes were identified, ie, monosomies 7 present in Ph-ALL (17%) and also in other ALL (8%) and two new recurrent translocations, t(1;11)(p34;pll) in T-ALL and t(1;7)(q11-21;q35-36) in Ph+ ALL. The ploidy groups with a favorable prognostic impact were hyperdiploidy greater than 50 without Ph chromosome (median event-free survival [EFS], 46 months) and tetraploidy (median EFS, 46 months). The recurrent abnormalities associated with better response to therapy were also significantly correlated to T-cell lineage. Among them, t(10;14)(q24;q11) (median EFS, 46 months) conferred the best prognostic impact (3-year EFS, 75%). Hypodiploidy 30-39 chromosomes and the related triploidy were associated with poor outcome. All Ph-ALL had short EFS (median EFS, 5 months), and no additional change affected this prognostic impact. Most patients with t(1;19) failed therapy within 1 year. Patients with 11q23 changes not because of t(4;11) had a poor outcome, although they did not present the high-risk factors found in t(4;11).",,,,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64715-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3135-42.,,,,,,['Blood 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2818'],,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, itraconazole is a potent candidate for in vivo use to revert multidrug resistance in acute leukemias, with the added benefit of its antifungal effect. As previously reported, itraconazole, as well as verapamil, reversed adriamycin-resistant K562 cells (K562/ADR) and HL60 cells (HL60/ADR) in dosages compatible to the plasma levels achieved by the therapeutic dosages used for the treatment of fungal infections. By RT-PCR analysis of mdr1, mdr3, and mrp mRNA, these adriamycin-resistant cells showed a higher expression of the transcript of these genes than those of the parent cells. By FACS analysis, both the adriamycin-resistant cells showed a higher expression of P-glycoprotein on their cell surfaces. These results suggested the involvement of itraconazole in the mdr gene and/or mrp gene product-associated resistance. Furthermore, itraconazole partially reversed etoposide resistance in both the K562 and K562/ADR cells. The present study suggests that itraconazole may reverse multidrug resistance, at least in part, via a classical MDR-associated mechanism.","['Kurosawa, M', 'Okabe, M', 'Hara, N', 'Kawamura, K', 'Suzuki, S', 'Sakurada, K', 'Asaka, M']","['Kurosawa M', 'Okabe M', 'Hara N', 'Kawamura K', 'Suzuki S', 'Sakurada K', 'Asaka M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00663011 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Jan;72(1):17-21. doi: 10.1007/BF00663011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study identifies other small areas (electoral wards) in West Cumbria where excess cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in young people have occurred and determines whether a recorded dose of radiation was received occupationally by the father before the conception of each of the affected individuals. Forty-one cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were diagnosed during 1968-85 in young people under 25 years of age resident in the 49 electoral wards lying within the boundary of West Cumbria and the adjacent ward of Broughton. Raised incidence rate ratios (two-sided P<0.01) were found for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia among those aged 0-14 years (concentrated among those aged 0-4 years) in Seascale ward and among those aged 0-24 years (also concentrated among those aged 0-4 years) in Egremont North ward, for acute myeloid leukaemia among those aged 0-14 years in Sandwith ward, for all leukaemias among those aged 0-14 years in Broughton ward (South Lakeland) and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among those aged 0-14 years in Seascale ward. For West Cumbria as a whole, incidence rates were not usual. Apart from Seascale, for none of these electoral wards has a father of an affected child been linked definitely to an occupational dose of radiation recorded before the conception of the child. Particularly striking are the excesses of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases among young children living in the wards of Seascale and Egremont North, situated 11 km apart. The cases in Egremont North are not associated with recorded doses of radiation received occupationally by fathers before the conception of the affected children, even though the total numbers of children associated with such doses born in Seascale and Egremont North wards are similar. This finding is further evidence against a causal role for paternal preconceptional radiation exposure in the cases of childhood leukaemia in Seascale.","['Wakeford, R', 'Parker, L']","['Wakeford R', 'Parker L']","['British Nuclear Fuels plc, Risley, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Paternal Exposure']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.117 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Mar;73(5):672-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.117.,,,,,PMC2074332,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the factors that may determine whether a child succumbs to c-ALL is how it responds to the candidate infection. Since immune responses to infection are under the partial control of (human leucocyte antigen) HLA genes, an association between an HLA allele and c-ALL could provide support for an infectious aetiology. To define the limit of c-ALL susceptibility within the HLA region, we have compared HLA-DQB1 allele frequencies in a cohort of 62 children with c-ALL with 76 newborn controls, using group-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We find that a significant excess of children with c-ALL type for DQB1*05 [relative risk (RR): 2.54, uncorrected P=0.038], and a marginal excess with DQB1*0501 (RR: 2.18; P=0.095). Only 3 of the 62 children with c-ALL have the other susceptibility allele, DPB1*0201 as well as DQB1*0501, whereas 15 had one or the other allele. This suggests that HLA-associated susceptibility may be determined independently by at least two loci, and is not due to linkage disequilibrium. The combined relative risk of the two groups of children with DPB1*0201 and/or DQB1*0501 is 2.76 (P=0.0076). Analysis of amino acids encoded by exon 2 of DQB1 reveal additional complexity, with significant (P<0.05) or borderline-significant increases in Gly26, His30, Val57, Glu66-Val67 encoding motifs in c-ALL compared with controls. Since these amino acids are not restricted to DQB1*0501, our results suggest that, as with DPB1, the increased risk of c-ALL associated with DQB1 is determined by specific amino acid encoding motifs rather than by an individual allele. These results also suggest that HLA-associated susceptibility to c-ALL may not be restricted to the region bounded by DPB1 and DQB1.","['Dearden, S P', 'Taylor, G M', 'Gokhale, D A', 'Robinson, M D', 'Thompson, W', 'Ollier, W', 'Binchy, A', 'Birch, J M', 'Stevens, R F', 'Carr, T', 'Bardsley, W G']","['Dearden SP', 'Taylor GM', 'Gokhale DA', 'Robinson MD', 'Thompson W', 'Ollier W', 'Binchy A', 'Birch JM', 'Stevens RF', 'Carr T', 'Bardsley WG']","[""Immunogenetics Laboratory, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQB1 antigen)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DQ beta-Chains', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.104 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Mar;73(5):603-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.104.,,,,,PMC2074350,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that exposure of HL-60 cells to chemical NO generators induces cell death via apoptosis which was examined by morphological and biochemical criteria. The activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (pADPRp) was found to occur during the process of cell death. The NO-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells was effectively prevented by the ADP-ribosylation inhibitors nicotinamide (NA) and 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB). Since NO not only induced apoptosis but also triggered differentiation under the same concentration, we thus examined whether pADPRp participated in monocytic differentiation. It is of interest to note that the NO-mediated monocytic differentiation was not affected by 3-AB or NA. These findings indicate that activation of pADPRp is specifically involved in NO-induced apoptosis but not differentiation.","['Kuo, M L', 'Chau, Y P', 'Wang, J H', 'Shiah, S G']","['Kuo ML', 'Chau YP', 'Wang JH', 'Shiah SG']","['Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Niacinamide/*pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Nitroprusside/*pharmacology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors']",1996/02/15 00:00,1996/02/15 00:01,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)90263-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0263 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Feb 15;219(2):502-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Splenectomy is performed for hematologic malignancies for diagnostic and therapeutic indications. The role of splenectomy for lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative malignancies is complex and sometimes controversial. METHODS: The medical records of 135 patients undergoing splenectomies for hematologic malignancies at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 1993 were reviewed retrospectively. These included Hodgkin's disease (HD), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and a miscellaneous group. RESULTS: The overall postoperative complication and mortality rates for all patients were 52% and 9%, respectively. The complication rate was 63% for patients whose spleens weighed greater than 2000 g, and 29% for patients whose spleens weighed less than 2000 g (p = 0.001). Seventy-three percent of the postoperative deaths were due to septic complications, only one of which was caused by an encapsulated organism. Complications occurred in less than 20% of patients with the diagnosis of HD and HCL; more than 50% of patients with NHL, CLL, and CML suffered postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy performed in patients with hematologic malignancies is a potentially morbid procedure. Splenic size was the only preoperative factor found to be predictive of postoperative complications. The complication rate differed significantly between the different diagnostic subgroups.","['Horowitz, J', 'Smith, J L', 'Weber, T K', 'Rodriguez-Bigas, M A', 'Petrelli, N J']","['Horowitz J', 'Smith JL', 'Weber TK', 'Rodriguez-Bigas MA', 'Petrelli NJ']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Division of Surgical Oncology, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000658-199603000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg. 1996 Mar;223(3):290-6. doi: 10.1097/00000658-199603000-00010.,['Ann Surg. 1997 Jan;225(1):131-2.

However, morphologic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity exist. Twenty-six patients with CLL were studied to investigate whether an association exists among peripheral blood karyotype, morphology and immunophenotype. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 14 patients (53%), using conventional karyotyping techniques in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome 12. By FAB guidelines, 7 of the 8 patients (88%) with trisomy 12 had mixed cell morphology compared to only 3 of 18 (17%) without trisomy 12 (P = .004). One patient (12%) with trisomy 12 had lymphocyte morphology typical for CLL. Six of the eight (75%) with trisomy 12 had atypical immunophenotype including one or more of the following: strong CD20 expression, strong surface light chain expression, or absence of CD23 expression.

The authors investigated the usefulness of the marker CD23 in discriminating between these processes by flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis. Consecutive samples of body fluids and hematopoietic tissue from patients with suspected B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders were studied using a panel of antibodies that included pan-B cell markers, CD5, FMC7, and CD23. Specimens from 38 patients with CD5-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders consisting of a monomorphic population of small lymphoid cells were identified. Using standard flow cytometric and/or morphologic criteria, 28 patients were classified as having SLL/CLL and 10 were classified as having MCL. Neoplastic cells from all 28 patients (100%) with SLL/CLL demonstrated CD23 immunoreactivity, whereas neoplastic cells from none of the 10 patients (0%) with MCL demonstrated CD23 immunoreactivity (P < .0001). FMC7 immunoreactivity was observed in one of eight cases of SLL/CLL and in five of five cases of MCL (P = .0047).

This study attempts to determine the rate of formation and the specificity of both RBC and HLA alloantibodies in this patient population. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: BMT patients (148 received autologous marrow; 45 received allogeneic marrow) from an 18-month period, including patients with leukemia (57 patients), lymphoma (54), breast cancer (68), myeloma (8), myelodysplastic syndrome (5), and aplastic anemia (1), were studied to determine the rate of alloantibody formation to RBC and HLA antigens. A total of 2,410 RBC antibody screens were performed. The patients received 3,921 packed RBCs and 5,915 single-donor platelet units; all were irradiated and administered via white cell-reduction filters. RESULTS: Seven (3.6%) of 193 patients had RBC antibodies upon hospital admission. Four (2.1%) of 193 developed RBC antibodies during the course of BMT: 3 patients had one RBC antibody and 1 patient had two RBC antibodies. RBC antibodies included anti-E (n = 2), anti-M (n = 1), anti-Jkb (n = 1), and anti-Lu14 (n = 1). Thus, 98 percent of patients (189/193) did not develop new (182/186) or additional (7/7) RBC antibodies during BMT. BMT patients were also screened weekly for HLA antibody formation (60-cell panel). Upon admission, 170 (85%) patients were negative. Of these, 8 (4.7%) developed persistent HLA antibodies (mean panel-reactive antibody score, 33 +/- 29%) and 9 (5.3%) were variably positive. Thus, in our setting and population, RBC antibody formation was 0.1 percent per unit transfused, and the HLA alloimmunization rate was 5 to 10 percent. CONCLUSION: As RBC antibody screens are done every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on this BMT service and as RBC antibody formation is low in these patients, screening for unexpected antibodies might be possible on a more infrequent basis. Also, the rate of HLA alloimmunization in this population receiving filtered blood components is low.","['Abou-Elella, A A', 'Camarillo, T A', 'Allen, M B', 'Barclay, S', 'Pierce, J A', 'Holland, H K', 'Wingard, J R', 'Bray, R A', 'Rodey, G E', 'Hillyer, C D']","['Abou-Elella AA', 'Camarillo TA', 'Allen MB', 'Barclay S', 'Pierce JA', 'Holland HK', 'Wingard JR', 'Bray RA', 'Rodey GE', 'Hillyer CD']","['Emory University Hospital Blood Bank, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Antibody Formation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.351196110898.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Nov-Dec;35(11):931-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.351196110898.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, preclinical and clinical data have strongly suggested the existence of an immune-mediated anti-tumor effect of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This effect, termed graft-versus-leukemia, may be harnessed purposefully in patients with posttransplant relapses by the administration of immune cells obtained by leukapheresis of the original bone marrow donor. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with persistent or recurrent hematologic malignancy after HLA-matched sibling-donor allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with transfusion of buffy coat cells collected from the original bone marrow donors. Mononuclear cell dose ranged from 1.18 to 4.28 x 10(8) per kg. Alpha-interferon (1.5-3 x 10(6) U/m2 3-5x/week) was given to seven patients. Patients were observed for the development of graft-versus-host disease and disease response. RESULTS: Three of five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia had complete remissions. One of five patients with active acute leukemia attained complete remission. A sixth acute leukemia patient treated with buffy coat transfusion after the induction of remission with chemotherapy relapsed 12 months later. One patient with myeloma had a complete but transient response. A patient with Hodgkin's disease did not respond. Four patients remain in remission 4, 16, 17, and 29 months after attaining complete remission. Graft-versus-host disease occurred in eight patients, including all of those with a complete response. One patient developed transient pancytopenia. CONCLUSION: The transfusion of donor buffy coat cells has significant anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancy after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This effect is strongly associated with graft-versus-host disease.","['Collins, R H Jr', 'Pineiro, L A', 'Nemunaitis, J J', 'Jain, V K', 'Waxman, D', 'Miller, W V', 'Fay, J W']","['Collins RH Jr', 'Pineiro LA', 'Nemunaitis JJ', 'Jain VK', 'Waxman D', 'Miller WV', 'Fay JW']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Research, Baylor University Medical Center/Texas Oncology, Dallas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1995/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.351196110891.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Nov-Dec;35(11):891-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.351196110891.x.,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Docetaxel was evaluated as a single agent against against seven mammary tumors, five from mice and two of human origin. Six of the seven models were found to be sensitive to docetaxel, exhibiting regressions of advanced-stage disease in murine models (MA16/C, MA13/C), and long tumor growth delays (Calc18) and cures (MX-1) in human tumor xenografts. In combination studies in tumor-bearing mice, synergism with docetaxel was observed with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide, vinorelbine (Navelbine; Pierre Fabre Oncologie, Boulogne, France), and methotrexate. A similar level of efficacy was obtained in the cases of docetaxel/vincristine and docetaxel/mitomycin C, compared with the activity of the best single agent. Good activity was obtained with the docetaxel/doxorubicin, docetaxel/vinblastine, and docetaxel/cisplatin combinations; however, the activity of these combinations was lower than that of the best agent in the combination when tested in monotherapy. In terms of tolerance, 60% to 70% of the highest nontoxic dose of each agent could be administered in combination, except for vinca alkaloids, in which 80% to 100% of the maximum tolerated dose did not cause additional toxicity. Although docetaxel is a very potent agent when used in monotherapy, the above results suggest that it also will have a key role in clinical combination chemotherapy.","['Bissery, M C', 'Vrignaud, P', 'Lavelle, F']","['Bissery MC', 'Vrignaud P', 'Lavelle F']","['Rhone-Poulenc Rorer SA, Centre de Recherche de Vitry-Alfortville, Vitry sur Seine, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Taxoids']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1995 Dec;22(6 Suppl 13):3-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible involvement of protein-tyrosine kinases in this activation we used human acute basophilic leukemia (ABL) cells in culture as well as a pure population of normal basophils in vitro-derived from human bone marrow precursor cells (HBMB). ABL cells were 50-80% basophils at various stages of maturation as assessed by staining, morphology, ultrastructure, and flow cytometry analysis, and only basophils in ABL cells expressed Fc epsilon RI. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI by IgE and anti-IgE, IgE and antigen, or anti-Fc epsilon RI monoclonal antibodies on ABL cells or on HBMB, led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 120-, 100-, 80-, 72-, 50- to 65-, and 38-kDa substrates. Tyrosine phosphorylations in ABL cells were in basophils because 1) they were detected after a 5-s stimulation, 2) they were observed under conditions where mediator release is minimal, i.e., in the absence of extracellular calcium, 3) hapten addition during antigen stimulation resulted in almost total disappearance of tyrosine phosphorylations within 30 s. There was correlation between histamine release and tyrosine phosphorylation in anti-IgE dose-responses and in dose-responses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. The tyrosine kinase p72syk was detected in the cells. Stimulation of ABL cells for 1 min resulted in extracellular calcium-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p72syk. Therefore, tyrosine kinases are involved in the early steps of human Fc epsilon RI signaling in basophils. Tyrosine kinases and their substrates could represent new potential therapeutic targets to prevent the development of the allergic reaction.","['Benhamou, M', 'Feuillard, J', 'Lortholary, O', 'Bourgeois, C', 'Michel, L', 'LeGoff, L', 'Michel, A', 'Mencia-Huerta, J M', 'Lejeune, F', 'Casassus, P', 'Debre, P', 'Arock, M']","['Benhamou M', 'Feuillard J', 'Lortholary O', 'Bourgeois C', 'Michel L', 'LeGoff L', 'Michel A', 'Mencia-Huerta JM', 'Lejeune F', 'Casassus P', 'Debre P', 'Arock M']","[""Groupe d'Immuno-Hematologie Moleculaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Male', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.59.3.461 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Mar;59(3):461-70. doi: 10.1002/jlb.59.3.461.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (mAb) suppressed LPS-driven TNF-alpha secretion by 61.6 +/- 5.9% (P<.001), and PAI-1, a uPA inhibitor, suppressed it to 53.1 +/- 8.2% of the control value (P<.001). Up-regulation of TNF-alpha mRNA was suppressed in parallel with secreted TNF-alpha protein. TNF-alpha secretion was unaffected by depleting plasminogen or by aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor. When endogenous uPA was displaced from the cell, exogenous high-molecular-weight (intact) uPA augmented LPS-driven TNF-alpha secretion. By contrast, a uPA fragment containing the catalytic domain was inhibitory, and the uPA receptor-binding domain had no effect. We conclude that endogenous uPA amplifies TNF-alpha neosynthesis of LPS-stimulated THP-1 mononuclear phagocytes. The effect requires intact uPA and is independent of plasmin activity. This represents a novel mechanism by which a mononuclear phagocyte-derived protease contributes to generating proinflammatory signals.","['Sitrin, R G', 'Shollenberger, S B', 'Strieter, R M', 'Gyetko, M R']","['Sitrin RG', 'Shollenberger SB', 'Strieter RM', 'Gyetko MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Fibrinolysin/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytes/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.59.2.302 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Feb;59(2):302-11. doi: 10.1002/jlb.59.2.302.,,,,"['HL-39672/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-50057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that THP-1 cells, human monocytic cells, produced alpha-MSH; this production was increased by interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor a, or concanavalin A. These cells also expressed the gene for the human alpha-MSH receptor MC1. Unlike murine macrophages, THP-1 cells produced little nitrite in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide, and a-MSH inhibited this production only slightly. However, production of neopterin, a presumed primate homologue of nitric oxide in lower animals, was increased in THP-1 cells stimulated with INF-gamma plus TNF-alpha and alpha-MSH significantly inhibited this production. The evidence indicates that an autocrine regulatory circuit based on alpha-MSH occurs in human monocyte/macrophages much as in murine macrophages. alpha-MSH-induced modulation of specific inflammatory mediators/cytotoxic agents appears to differ depending on the importance of the mediators in the myelomonocytic cells of different species.","['Rajora, N', 'Ceriani, G', 'Catania, A', 'Star, R A', 'Murphy, M T', 'Lipton, J M']","['Rajora N', 'Ceriani G', 'Catania A', 'Star RA', 'Murphy MT', 'Lipton JM']","['Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas 75235-9040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Corticotropin)', '0 (Receptors, Melanocortin)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Hormone)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '810S9KV11R (MSH receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Neopterin', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Corticotropin/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Melanocortin', 'Receptors, Pituitary Hormone/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'alpha-MSH/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.59.2.248 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Feb;59(2):248-53. doi: 10.1002/jlb.59.2.248.,,,,"['DK 45923/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 10046/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that gnidimacrin acts as a PKC activator for tumor cells and that this mechanism may be responsible for its antitumor activity.","['Yoshida, M', 'Feng, W', 'Saijo, N', 'Ikekawa, T']","['Yoshida M', 'Feng W', 'Saijo N', 'Ikekawa T']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Toyko, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '60796-70-5 (gnidimacrin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/10 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/04/10 00:00'],"['1996/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960410)66:2<268::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960410)66:2<268::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Apr 10;66(2):268-73. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960410)66:2<268::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of this interaction with bone-marrow stromal cells was studied in a human in vitro model. Migration behavior of erythroleukemia cell line K562, derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, was compared with that of the erythroleukemia cell line HEL92.1.7 and the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 from acute leukemias. Interaction varied between low binding affinity (K562) to intensive cell interaction (HEL92.1.7) followed by invasion into the stromal cell monolayer. Some of the HL60 cells adhered to stromal cells, while the remainder migrated into the stromal cell monolayer. The role of adhesion molecules in these cell interactions was determined. Distinct expression of beta1-integrins ICAM-1, CD44 and VCAM-1 was detected on the different cell lines. Inhibition studies pointed to a dominant role of VLA-4- and VLA-5-mediated interactions. K562 lacked VLA-4 and a low binding affinity of the VLA-5 on these cells resulted in an absence of binding to the bone-marrow stroma.

In parallel with the Ca2+ response, these agents also inhibited inositol polyphosphate production.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) also increased [Ca2+]i in the cels, but the maximal response was about half of that of S1P, and furthermore PTX and dibutyryl cAMP treatment hardly affected the LPA-induced Ca2+ mobilization.

Three DNAs were used: a double-stranded 20-bp oligonucleotide of defined sequence, calf thymus DNA and murine leukemia L1210 cellular DNA. With high concentrations of mechlorethamine, there was a marked decrease in normal dGp, a lesser decrease in dAp and dCp and no change in dTp. Using 2D mapping PEI-cellulose thin-layer chromatography analyses, it was found that six mechlorethamine: DNA adducts were produced after a short exposure to mechlorethamine. After an extended time at relatively high drug concentrations there was an alteration in the mechlorethamine: DNA adduct pattern that may reflect the conversion of monoadducts to crosslinked adducts. Similar observations were made with cisplatin and adozelesin. When murine leukemia L1210 cells were treated with 50 microM mechlorethamine or 50 microM cisplatin for 1 h, six or more mechlorethamine: DNA adducts and five cisplatin: DNA adducts were detected. After allowing 6 h. for repair of potentially lethal damage, several adducts were no longer detectable and others appeared with diminished intensity. Nuclease P(1) dephosphorylates normal nucleotides at relatively low enzyme concentrations with variation depending upon the nucleotide. In general, considerably lower concentrations of nuclease P1 were required to dephosphorylate the normal nucleotides than to dephosphorylate the antitumor alkylating agent: nucleotide adducts, thus allowing increased sensitivity of the postlabeling assay. The sensitivity of detection of antitumor alkylating agent: DNA adducts in DNA from treated L1210 cells approached one adduct per 10(7)-10(8) nucleotides. These results suggest that the postlabeling technique may be sufficiently sensitive and specific for the study of the clinically effective levels of antitumor alkylating agents.","['Zhou, G H', 'Teicher, B A', 'Frei, E 3rd']","['Zhou GH', 'Teicher BA', 'Frei E 3rd']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '6N3M4XJR2V (adozelesin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemistry/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzofurans', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cisplatin/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cyclohexenes', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Duocarmycins', '*Indoles', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/pathology', 'Mechlorethamine/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050450 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(1):71-80. doi: 10.1007/s002800050450.,,,,['5P01-CA38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacophoric alkyldiamine group, which is also present in anthracenediones (e.g. ametantrone, mitoxantrone), has been shown to be responsible for their antineoplastic activity. In view of their chemical similarity to anthracenediones, we anticipated that the imidazoacridinones would have a mechanism of action similar to that of these agents and that this would be reflected by a similar influence on cell-cycle progression. Flow cytometry was used to monitor the effect of three derivatives of imidazoacridinone (C-1263, C-1310 and C-1311) on L1210 cell cycle traverse at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.9 microgram/ml, corresponding to their 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90 values), over times of drug treatment ranging from 1 to 48 h. The results demonstrate that all of the compounds produced a similar effect, inducing preferential and complete arrest (accumulation) of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. G2 block). The kinetics of the induction of G2 arrest were dependent on both the dose and the duration of treatment. Cell-cycle arrest was reversible for up to about 3 h of treatment, being quite irreversible at longer incubation times.

In an attempt to reduce that variability the current practise in the United Kingdom for the last 4 years has been to escalate the amount prescribed in patients who do not experience cytopenias at 75 mg/m2. We undertook a study to see whether that strategy would increase the total dose of 6MP prescribed in such patients and whether it would alter the pattern of myelosuppression. Over a 6-month period we studied 44 children treated conventionally (without escalation) and compared them with another 44 (matched for sex) who were treated on the same protocol but where doses were increased in monthly 25% steps if 75 mg/m2 was tolerated without cytopenias. We then compared the two groups for the total dose of drug prescribed and the frequency and duration of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. The median cumulative dose of 6MP received by the conventionally treated children (10,002 mg/m2) was not significantly different from that of the children treated with dose escalation (9,429 mg/m2). In a comparison of the 30 children who actually received inflated doses of 6MP with the 37 from the conventional cohort who would have been eligible to do so, it was again found that the cumulative median doses were similar (10,460 versus 10,916 mg/m2). There was a difference between the two groups in the pattern of myelosuppression -- the escalated group spent significantly more time off 6MP than did the non-escalated group (median 4.5 versus 3 weeks; P<0.005, 95% CI from -1 to -3). These findings imply that the method of dose escalation employed does not allow more 6MP to be prescribed in children tolerant of the standard dose. The chief effect seems to be to generate longer periods off therapy, and this could paradoxically decrease the anti-neoplastic activity of the drug. Alternative ways of prescribing should be explored.","['Welch, J C', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Welch JC', 'Lilleyman JS']","[""University of Sheffield, Department of Paediatrics, The Children's Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050457 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(1):113-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800050457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that topo I was distributed throughout the nuclei but was concentrated in nucleoli of untreated K562 leukemia cells and A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Treatment with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin did not alter this distribution. In contrast, 30-60 min after addition of the RNA synthesis inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) at concentrations that inhibited [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA by > or = 50%, topo I was visible throughout the nuclei without nucleolar accentuation.

Within 30 min of DRB removal, topo I relocalized to the nucleoli in the absence or presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Collectively, these results suggest a reversible translocation of topo I out of the nucleoli when RNA synthesis is inhibited. Treatment with the topo I poisons topotecan or camptothecin, agents that also inhibit RNA synthesis, likewise caused redistribution of topo I to nonnucleolar regions of the nucleus in a variety of cell types. In DC3F hamster lung fibroblasts, 2.5 microM topotecan or 1.25 microM camptothecin was sufficient to cause this topo I redistribution. In DC3F/C-10 cells that contain a mutant camptothecin-resistant topo I, topo I relocalization required 50-fold higher concentrations of topotecan or camptothecin but not DRB. These observations not only suggest that accumulation of topo I in the nucleolus is related to ongoing RNA synthesis but also raise the possibility of screening for some types of camptothecin resistance at the single-cell level using a rapid immunofluorescence-based assay.","['Buckwalter, C A', 'Lin, A H', 'Tanizawa, A', 'Pommier, Y G', 'Cheng, Y C', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Buckwalter CA', 'Lin AH', 'Tanizawa A', 'Pommier YG', 'Cheng YC', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'RNA/*biosynthesis', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Apr 1;56(7):1674-81.,,,,['CA44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here the isolation of a variant of HL-60 cells, HCW-2, which was resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 8-Cl-cAMP, but still underwent growth arrest. Thus, HCW-2 cells appeared to be altered in their ability to undergo apoptosis. HCW-2 cells were also completely refractory to the apoptotic action of cycloheximide and staurosporine, two compounds which were very potent inducers of apoptosis in the parental HL-60 cells, suggesting that the resistance to apoptosis was not unique to 8-Cl-cAMP. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the parental HL-60 cells expressed both Bcl-2 and Bax, two factors known to be intimately involved in the control of apoptosis. Surprisingly, HCW-2 cells no longer expressed Bcl-2 protein and paradoxically contained Bax protein at a level that was approximately 50-fold higher than in HL-60 cells. However, Northern and Western analyses indicated that the apoptotic suppressor gene, bcl-xL, which is not expressed in the parental HL-60 cells, was expressed in HCW-2 cells. Thus, the Bcl-2-independent resistance of HCW-2 cells to apoptotic induction is discussed in terms of the expression of bcl-xL.","['Han, Z', 'Chatterjee, D', 'Early, J', 'Pantazis, P', 'Hendrickson, E A', 'Wyche, J H']","['Han Z', 'Chatterjee D', 'Early J', 'Pantazis P', 'Hendrickson EA', 'Wyche JH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Staurosporine', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Apr 1;56(7):1621-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 1,296 second cancers occurred against 1,014 expected [observed/expected (O/E), 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.35]. Sites contributing 25 or more excess cancers included leukemia (O/E, 4.17; O, 111; 95% CI, 3.43-5.03) and malignancies of colon (O/E, 1.33; O, 188; 95% CI, 1.15-1.54), rectum (O/E, 1.43; O, 76; 95% CI, 1.13-1.79), breast (O/E, 1.18; O, 404; 95%, CI 1.07-1.30), and bladder (O/E, 2.07; O, 65; 95% CI, 1.59-2.63). Ocular melanoma (O/E, 4.45; O, 8; 95% CI, 1.92-8.77) was also significantly increased. Second cancer risk was high during all follow-up intervals, and cumulative risk at 20 years was 18.2%, compared with a population expected risk of 11.5%. Statistically significant relationships existed between serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary and breast cancer (O/E, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06-1.56) and mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma and rectal cancer (OE/E, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.09-3.22). Secondary leukemia appeared linked with antecedent chemotherapy, whereas radiotherapy was associated with cancers of connective tissue, bladder, and possibly pancreas. Genetic and reproductive factors predisposing to ovarian cancer may have contributed to the elevated risk of breast and colorectal neoplasms and possibly ocular melanoma. Thus, excess malignancies following ovarian cancer represent complications of curative therapies and/or underlying susceptibility states that have etiological and clinical ramifications.","['Travis, L B', 'Curtis, R E', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Platz, C E', 'Hankey, B F', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Travis LB', 'Curtis RE', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Platz CE', 'Hankey BF', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*complications', 'Risk', 'Survivors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/etiology']",1996/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Apr 1;56(7):1564-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid treatment of NB4 and NTERA-2 cells, and hexamethylene bisacetamide treatment of NTERA-2 cells caused a decline in telomerase activity in differentiation-sensitive but not in resistant clones of these cell lines. Changes in telomerase activity as measured by the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay were noted by 24-72 h of exposure to the inducer, suggesting that its regulation may precede terminal differentiation. The degree of telomerase activity decline was greater in NB4 cells than in NTERA-2 cells, probably reflecting in part a more mature state of NB4 cells after 5 days of exposure to the inducer. Mixing of protein extracts from treated and untreated cells did not suggest the presence of diffusible telomerase inhibitors. Expression of the RNA component of telomerase was also examined in NB4 cells, and its decline correlated with the reduced telomerase activity measured by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay during induced differentiation of these tumor cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that telomerase is a regulated enzyme system during induced human tumor cell differentiation, showing an inverse relationship between the degree of differentiation and telomerase activity. These models will be be useful to study the regulation and role of telomerase during induced differentiation of human tumor cells.","['Albanell, J', 'Han, W', 'Mellado, B', 'Gunawardane, R', 'Scher, H I', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Moore, M A']","['Albanell J', 'Han W', 'Mellado B', 'Gunawardane R', 'Scher HI', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Moore MA']","['Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Apr 1;56(7):1503-8.,,,,"['R01-CA54494-04A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA62275-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA67842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized the karyotypic changes in two sublines of HL-60 cells which differ in the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. The parental sublines, designated HL-60A/S and HL-60Y/S, were selected in increasing concentrations of 0.025-0.1 micrograms/mL DOX. Monosomy 8 in HL-60Y/S was the only karyotypic difference prior to DOX exposure. Both sublines acquired 7q+ markers upon exposure to DOX. In HL-60Y/S, and add(7)(q21) replaced one homologue at 0.025 micrograms/mL DOX, and an add(7)(q32) appeared which replaced the other normal 7 at 0.05 micrograms/mL DOX. The HL-60A/S cells acquired an add(7)(q21) at 0.025 micrograms/mL DOX. The 7q+ abnormalities involved breakpoints in the midregion of 7q. The overexpression of phosphorylated PGP in immunoprecipitates with C-219 antibody was identified in both sublines of DOX-resistant HL-60 cells with 7q+ abnormalities, and this is consistent with the location of mdr-1 sequences to 7q21-21.1. Also, analysis of RNA from parental-sensitive and DOX-resistant sublines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed: a) comparable expression of multidrug resistance related protein (MPR) in sensitive and resistant sublines; and b) overexpression of mdr-1 only in the DOX-resistant sublines. Thus, the selection of DOX resistance in two sublines of HL-60 cells which differ in their response to retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation is reproducibly associated with overexpression of mdr-1 versus MRP.","['Ganapathi, R', 'Hoeltge, G', 'Casey, G', 'Grabowski, D', 'Neelon, R', 'Ford, J']","['Ganapathi R', 'Hoeltge G', 'Casey G', 'Grabowski D', 'Neelon R', 'Ford J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(95)00207-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00207-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Feb;86(2):116-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00207-3.,,,,['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is located at chromosome 9p21 and encodes an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases. In contrast with the observations in some other malignancies, no inactivation of MTS1 by intragenic mutation was demonstrated in leukaemias. A contribution of MTS1 alterations to leukaemogenesis therefore remains questionable. In order to test for the implication of MTS1 as a tumour suppressor gene in paediatric ALLs we have explored the 9p21 chromosomal region of 46 children with this disease. The copy number of the MTS1 gene in blasts from the patients was determined using a quantitative PCR assay enabling us to precisely detect mono- and bi-allelic deletions. Rearrangements of the gene were sought by Southern blot analysis. The extent of the deletions was studied using microsatellite markers spanning the 9p21 chromosomal region. Point mutations were sought in exon 1 and exon 2 of the MTS1 gene in patients with a mono-allelic deletion in addition, exon 2 of MTS1, which contains two-thirds of the coding region, was sequenced in all patients who had no deletion of the gene. Altogether, our data are consistent with the view that MTS1 is the target of 9p21 deletions. Either one or two alleles of the gene were deleted in 36% of non-selected children with B-lineage ALL and both alleles were deleted in all seven patients we studied with T-lineage ALL. The absence of any point mutation implies that the major mechanism of inactivation of MTS1 in ALLs is deletional.","['Guidal-Giroux, C', 'Gerard, B', 'Cave, H', 'Duval, M', 'Rohrlich, P', 'Elion, J', 'Vilmer, E', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Guidal-Giroux C', 'Gerard B', 'Cave H', 'Duval M', 'Rohrlich P', 'Elion J', 'Vilmer E', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Genetique, Faculte de Medecine Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/genetics']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1497.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Feb;92(2):410-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1497.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The histogram for CD45RO fluorescence intensity (FI) revealed two patterns: pattern A consisted of CD45RO+ cells with high FI (CD45ROhigh) and intermediate FI (CD45ROint). Pattern B consisted exclusively of CD45ROhigh. Pattern A was evident in all volunteers. The percentage of subjects showing pattern B was increased in an order that reflected disease progression. In the patients with pattern A, the CD45ROint cells were CD4+ and CD8-, and the FI of CD2, CD3, and Fas within the CD45ROint cells appeared to be lower than that within the CD45ROhigh cells.

Five chromosome groups were defined: (1) trisomy 12 (18%), detected as the sole abnormality or associated with other changes; (2) del(13)(q12-14) (7%); (3) other abnormal karyotypes (20%); (4) normal karyotype (41%); and (5) no divisions (14%).

Atypical morphology and CLL/PL were even more frequent when trisomy 12 was associated with other chromosomal abnormalities (70% v 46%). The incidence of cases with CLL/PL and other atypical morphology was significantly lower in the other chromosome groups (P < 0.001). There were no differences in immunophenotype among the various groups except for a higher frequency of stronger Smlg and FMC7 expression in cases with trisomy 12, particularly those with CLL/PL and other atypical morphology.

After 4 years following diagnosis, a rapid deterioration of the clinical picture occurred, concomitant with the appearance of large lymphoid blasts in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and ascites samples. A diagnosis of RS was made and cytogenetic analysis revealed karyotype evolution with trisomy 7 and del(17p) in addition to t(11;14). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed 78% lymphoid blast cells obtained from ascites sample to be trisomic using a chromosome-7-specific pericentromeric probe. Whereas no rearrangement of the c-myc proto-oncogene was detected at disease progression, direct sequencing of p53 gene exon 5-9 revealed an exon 7 missense point mutation. This abnormality was not present in the CLL phase. Immunological staining with the monoclonal antibody PAb-1801, detecting the p53 protein product, revealed a negative pattern in the CLL phase, whereas 24% positivity was documented in representative samples obtained at RS. It is concluded that RS was cytogenetically related with B-CLL in this patient, suggesting the occurrence of a bona fide transformation and that the mutation of p53 exon 7, in association with the development of 17p deletion, possibly played a role in the development of RS.","['Cuneo, A', 'de Angeli, C', 'Roberti, M G', 'Piva, N', 'Bigoni, R', 'Gandini, D', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Moretti, S', 'Cavazzini, P', 'del Senno, L', 'Castoldi, G']","['Cuneo A', 'de Angeli C', 'Roberti MG', 'Piva N', 'Bigoni R', 'Gandini D', 'Rigolin GM', 'Moretti S', 'Cavazzini P', 'del Senno L', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1505.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Feb;92(2):375-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1505.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finnish Leukaemia Group.,370-4,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a major growth factor for the clonal malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma (MM). The effect of IL-6 may be enhanced by soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). As there is a clinical need for improved stratification of MM patients at diagnosis, we have studied the role of sIL-6R as a prognostic marker in 207 newly diagnosed MM patients. Serum sIL-6R concentration was above the upper reference limit in 47% of the patients at diagnosis. The concentrations of sIL-6R and two other prognostic factors, IL-6 and beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2M), were all significantly higher in the patients who died within 3 years compared with those who survived. However, serum sIL-6R did not show linear correlation with IL-6 or beta 2M levels. In univariate logistic regression analysis sIL-6R was a significant predictor of 3-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that raised levels of sIL-6r were associated with shorter survival. When the patients were stratified into four groups according to their serum IL-6 and sIL-6R levels the patients with normal serum levels of both parameters had clear survival benefit. As beta 2M was the most powerful prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis, the patients were also stratified according to their serum beta 2M and sIL-6R levels. The patients with raised levels of both beta 2M and sIL-6R had shorter survival than the patients in the other three groups. Thus, measurement of these parameters at diagnosis would help to stratify MM patients.","['Pulkki, K', 'Pelliniemi, T T', 'Rajamaki, A', 'Tienhaara, A', 'Laakso, M', 'Lahtinen, R']","['Pulkki K', 'Pelliniemi TT', 'Rajamaki A', 'Tienhaara A', 'Laakso M', 'Lahtinen R']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1470.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Feb;92(2):370-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1470.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most of the cases no fewer than 1000 metaphases were analysed. Six patients (24%) showed residual Ph+ cells during the first 6 months and two others by the end of the first year after BMT. Three patients relapsed during the study and in two of them residual Ph+ cells were detected during the first 6 months after BMT. In 17 patients no Ph+ cells were detected at any stage of follow-up and 16 (94.1%) of them continue in complete clinical and haematological remission. Our results indicate that metaphase-FISH is a reliable tool in the quantitation of proliferating residual leukaemic cells.

Three children had received prior cytotoxic treatment (group 1); all of these had cytogenetic abnormalities and died shortly after diagnosis. 22 children had constitutional anomalies (group 2). The remaining 24 MDS were considered as 'primary' (group 3). Hypoplastic marrow was found in nine cases, and only 53% of the MDS fitted the adult FAB classification. Transformation to AML occurred in 11 cases, development of aplastic anaemia in three cases, and spontaneous remission in one case each of RA and RAEB. Differences were observed between groups 2 and 3 in terms of mean age at diagnosis (11.1 months v 5 years), rate of cytogenetic anomalies (15% v 38%) and rate of progression towards acute leukaemia (13% v 29%). In group 2, all the fur girls studied exhibited a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation, which suggests that MDS may be only the haematological expression of an embryological defect with different target tissues.

Since thrombin has putative effects on the growth and differentiation of megakaryocytes, we hypothesized that the phenotypic abnormalities in megakaryocytopoiesis observed in the 5q- syndrome may be partially explained by involvement of the TR gene in the interstitial deletion. We have utilized molecular and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to study potential cytogenetic abnormalities of the thrombin receptor gene in patients demonstrating this abnormality. Dual-label FISH with a q12-specific genomic fragment and the TR gene was completed using interphase and metaphase cells from seven patients with a del(5)(q13q33). Our data demonstrate that the TR gene is located on the centromeric side of the common proximal breakpoint, and is grossly present in all patients with the affected 5q- chromosome. In addition, one of the seven patients demonstrated a small proximal rearrangement, most likely representing a paracentric inversion, which was not apparent by conventional cytogenetic techniques. The significance of these alterations is discussed.","['Demetrick, D J', 'Dewald, G W', 'Lanman, J', 'Bahou, W F']","['Demetrick DJ', 'Dewald GW', 'Lanman J', 'Bahou WF']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/*genetics', 'Centromere', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombin/*genetics']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1504.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Feb;92(2):339-43. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1504.x.,,,,"['HL-02431/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49141/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal donor bone marrow the assay enables simultaneous identification of immature (CD13+, CD14-, CD66-), intermediate (CD13+, myelopoietic differentiation stages through the exclusion of CD14+ monocytic cells. In the diagnosis and longitudinal follow-up of AML patients the assay was of value in the fast determination of remission state. In MDS, the immature myeloid component could be distinguished in patients defined according to the FAB classification with the possibility of identifying aberrant phenotypes, the assay should also be of interest in other myeloproliferative disorders.

Subsequent stimulation of heme and globin synthesis led to a differential quantitative expression of hemoglobins. Gower 1 (epsilon2, zeta2) was the major type for ACLA and X (epsilon2, gamma2) for DOX. Although ACLA and DOX increased both the expression of gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase mRNAs, striking differences were observed in the expression of erythropoietin receptor mRNAs and in erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2, known to play a key role in erythroid gene regulation. Indeed, ACLA induces an increase either in the binding capacity of GATA-1 and NF-E2 or in the accumulation of erythropoietin receptor, GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcripts. In contrast, their expression with DOX was not significantly modified compared to uninduced cells, except for a slight decrease in NF-E2 expression on day 3. In conclusion, these data show that: 1. increased expression of erythroid transcription factors and erythroid genes are associated only with ACLA treatment, and 2. although cytotoxicity of both ACLA and DOX is certainly dependent on DNA intercalation, regulation of differentiation processes by these two drugs involves distinct mechanisms.","['Morceau, F', 'Aries, A', 'Lahlil, R', 'Devy, L', 'Jardillier, J C', 'Jeannesson, P', 'Trentesaux, C']","['Morceau F', 'Aries A', 'Lahlil R', 'Devy L', 'Jardillier JC', 'Jeannesson P', 'Trentesaux C']","['Laboratoire De Biochimie, GIBSA, UFR De Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/22 00:00,1996/03/22 00:01,['1996/03/22 00:00'],"['1996/03/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/22 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)02240-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)02240-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Mar 22;51(6):839-45. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)02240-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, commitment to cell differentiation has been shown to be preceded by down regulation of deltaPKC, a process significantly accelerated and induced to almost completion by the differentiation enhancing factor (DEF) in a dose dependent manner. The present results provide a better understanding of the role of deltaPKC in characterizing the undifferentiated MEL cell phenotype and suggest a relationship between the acceleration in the rate of differentiation induced by DEF and the down regulation of this kinase form.","['Patrone, M', 'Pessino, A', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Sparatore, B', 'Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S']","['Patrone M', 'Pessino A', 'Passalacqua M', 'Sparatore B', 'Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Prkcd protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', '*HMGB1 Protein', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/07 00:00,1996/03/07 00:01,['1996/03/07 00:00'],"['1996/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)90350-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0350 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Mar 7;220(1):26-30. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this period, the phenotype of the tumor cells in the blood changed from that of hairy cell leukemia (HCL)/chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL) to HCL/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), to PLL. The lymphoid population in the blood showed a mixture of hairy cells, villous lymphocytes, small lymphocytes, and prolymphocytes, corresponding to the phenotypes at various stages. Although relatively specific markers for CLL, HCL, and PLL, such as CD5, CD11c, CD22, CD25, and FMC-7, were positive at various stages, all these markers have also been demonstrated in a large study series of splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL). In addition, the histologic pattern of the bone marrow biopsy and splenectomy specimen were not typical for HCL. This case can therefore be classified either as HCL variant or as SLVL. As SLVL assumes various cytologic and histologic patterns, which overlap with different lymphoproliferative disorders, especially HCL variants, this entity appears to represent a heterogeneous group of lymphomas/leukemias that may evolve into each other. The absence of activation of c-myc and bc1-2 oncogenes as well as mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene, together with the presence of only one single rearranged band for both heavy chain and kappa light chain genes in our case suggest that these morphologically different lymphoid tumors may belong to the same family.","['Sun, T', 'Dittmar, K', 'Koduru, P', 'Susin, M', 'Teichberg, S', 'Brody, J']","['Sun T', 'Dittmar K', 'Koduru P', 'Susin M', 'Teichberg S', 'Brody J']","['Departments of Laboratories, Medicine and Pediatrics, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*classification/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Oncogenes', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/surgery']",1996/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199604)51:4<282::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199604)51:4<282::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-S [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Apr;51(4):282-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199604)51:4<282::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, two patients who received G-CSF with 30 mg/kg of VP-16 developed hyperbilirubinemia and veno-occlusive disease, which terminated this phase I study. VP-16 can be safely combined with BU/CY < or = 30 mg/kg in three divided doses, and its effect on survival should be evaluated.

Samples from 542 individual patients either attending medical practitioners or during hospitalization were examined and then subdivided for the purposes of this study into 106 samples from newborn infants (< days), 145 samples from older children (15 days to 14 years) with non-oncologic disorders, 100 samples from normal adults, and 191 samples from oncology patient (97 adults and 94 children). The leukocyte differentials provided by both the Abbott CD3500 and the Coulter STKS were compared with those obtained from conventional morphology (two observers, total of 400 leukocytes). The sensitivities and specificities of the blast, immature granulocyte (IG) and NRBC ""flags"" were also determined. For the non-oncology adult (n=100) and pediatric (n=145) cohorts, automated differentials were given in all samples with the CD3500, whereas the STKS did not provide a differential analysis for 20 of the 145 (14%) pediatric samples, 11 of these were absent for no obvious reason. However, for the evaluable cases, the performances of the CD3500 and the STKS were broadly similar and generally correlated well with the manual reference procedure. The results for the newborn samples were less consistent with wider 95% confidence intervals (CI) noted. For example, the CD3500 (which reported a differential for all 106 samples studied) gave CI values of +/-14.4% for neutrophils, +/-14.6% for lymphocytes and +/-8.1% for monocytes. For comparison, the STKS (which did not provide a differential in 15% of 79 samples analyzed; insufficient material being available from the remaining 27 of 106 newborn samples) gave CI values of +/-21.9% for neutrophils, +/-23.5% for lymphocytes and +/-8.2% for monocytes. For all samples, the sensitivity of the blast flag on the CD3500 was 85% with a specificity of 91% (STKS: sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 85%); the sensitivity of the CD3500 IG flag was 72% with a specificity of 76% (STKS: sensitivity, 75%: specificity, 73%); and the sensitivity of the NRBC flag was 43% with a specificity of 94%(STKS sensitivity, 37%; specificity, 88%).

In a prospective controlled study, patients with fever who were receiving empiric gentamicin for confirmed or suspected infections were separated into three groups: 29 with cancer who were receiving a continuing chemotherapy protocol with nonnephrotoxic antineoplastic agents; 23 with cancer who were receiving a continuing chemotherapy protocol with nephrotoxic antineoplastic agents; and 25 control patients who did not have cancer. Three blood samples (one predose, two postdose concentrations), collected between the third and sixth gentamicin doses from each patient, were analyzed by the Emit assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and gentamicin dosages recommended based on the Sawchuk-Zaske method of serum level interpretation. When normalized by body weight, there was no significant difference in clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life between the control group and either group of patients with cancer. However, when normalized by body surface area, patients receiving prior nephrotoxic chemotherapy appeared to have a lower mean clearance (98.2 ml/min/1.73 m2) than those exposed to nonnephrotoxic chemotherapy (117.4 ml/min/1.73 m2) and controls (113.3 ml/min/1.73 m2; ANCOVA p = 0.033). When kinetic parameters were normalized by body weight, the effect of advancing age yielded a decrease in both clearance (p < 0.001) and volume of distribution (p = 0.02), and an increase in gentamicin half-life (p < 0.001). When normalized by body surface area, age had no significant effect on clearance (p = 0.579). There was no significant difference in gentamicin daily dose requirements (mg/kg) between the chemotherapy groups, which may be due to the lack of significant effects of chemotherapy on gentamicin's volume of distribution and clearance normalized by body weight. The final maintenance doses (mg/kg/day, mean +/- SD) for patients with cancer were 10.8 +/- 1.8 for those age 1-5 years, 8.9 +/- 1.1 for those age 6-12 years, and 7.9 +/- 1.9 for those age 13-18 years. However, when normalized by body surface area, the age-dependent doses became remarkably similar for children in all three age groups (ANOVA p = 0.932), approximately 250 mg/m2/day. We recommend that pediatric patients with cancer who require treatment for fever and neutropenia be given higher than standard gentamicin dosages to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations promptly. In particular, initial empiric doses of 10 mg/kg/day are appropriate for those age 1-5 years.","['Ho, K K', 'Bryson, S M', 'Thiessen, J J', 'Greenberg, M L', 'Einarson, T R', 'Leson, C L']","['Ho KK', 'Bryson SM', 'Thiessen JJ', 'Greenberg ML', 'Einarson TR', 'Leson CL']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Services, Toronto East General Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/metabolism', 'Gentamicins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/drug therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Prospective Studies']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 1995 Nov-Dec;15(6):754-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we present the preparation and structure--functional analysis of recombinant human CNTF. The human CNTF gene was expressed under the control of the PL promoter in Escherichia coli, and the mutants were constructed by insertion, deletion and site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant proteins were purified from bacteria via DEAE A-50 and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography, and their survival promoting activities were determined using cultures of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Insertion at position 23 with APGL, or at position 79 with PRGA, or substitution of 162L163Q for PIDG resulted in proteins with no neurotrophic activity. However, insertion at position 186 with PRGI did not alter human CNTF activity. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal amino acid 186-200 did not reduce the biological activity, but elimination of the amino acid 162-186 abolished the activity. The mutant substituting of 17 Cys for Ser was found to display a biological activity equivalent to that of the wild type. Our data provided experimental confirmation for the structural prediction of CNTF.","['He, C', 'Chen, J', 'Ao, S', 'Lu, C']","['He C', 'Chen J', 'Ao S', 'Lu C']","['Department of Neurobiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Neurosci Res,Neuroscience research,8500749,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Ganglia, Spinal/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/pharmacology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-0102(95)00958-V [pii]', '10.1016/0168-0102(95)00958-V [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Res. 1995 Nov;23(4):327-33. doi: 10.1016/0168-0102(95)00958-V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the murine adenocarcinoma MAC16, cachexia is mediated by circulatory catabolic factors, which we have now isolated using an antibody cloned from splenocytes of mice transplanted with the MAC16 tumour, with a delayed cachexia. The material is a proteoglycan of relative molecular mass 24K which produces cachexia in vivo by inducing catabolism of skeletal muscle. The 24K material was also present in urine of cachectic cancer patients, but was absent from normal subjects, patients with weight loss due to trauma, and cancer patients with little or no weight loss.

Analysis of known viral integration loci revealed only a small number of insertions at bmi-1, pim-1 and ahi-1. Further cloning and hybridization analysis revealed a new common integration locus, designated til-1, which was occupied in 25 out of 77 lymphomas examined, with evidence of multiple clonal insertions in some cases. Mapping relative to established chromosomal markers in interspecific backcross mice located til-1 to mouse chromosome 17, distal to pim-1 and tic-1.

It was found that synthesis of the TCR cDNAs increases in a roughly linear fashion at primer concentrations between 0.005-0.05 muM. Evaluation of the use of low concentration (0.005 muM) of primers showed these conditions to be adequate for the analysis of TCR Vbeta subfamilies in the spleen of BALB/c mice, but not in the peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), the latter requiring ten-fold higher concentrations of the variable region primers to compensate for the overall low frequency of T lymphocytes in the PECs in comparison to the spleen. Use of these optimal conditions to detect L1210 tumor specific T lymphocyte responses showed that, in the immunized mice, L1210 specific T lymphocyte responses are detectable in the PECs, but not in the spleen cells from these mice. Thus, upon i.p. immunization of DBA/2 mice with irradiated L1210 lymphoma cells, followed by analysis of the PECs by RT/PCR, three TCR Vbeta subfamilies, including Vbeta8.2, Vbeta15 and Vbeta16 were found to contain specific major TCR cDNA bands. The approach described here is very efficient, as it uses a small amount of the 32P isotope (0.5 muCi) followed by direct analysis of the PCR products on a denaturing acrylamide/urea gel. Furthermore, data is also presented that shows that quantitative differences in the levels of individual TCR cDNAs in a particular Vbeta subfamily are preserved during PCR amplification.","['Abu-hadid, M M', 'Fuji, H', 'Hsu, S', 'Sood, A K']","['Abu-hadid MM', 'Fuji H', 'Hsu S', 'Sood AK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Spleen/cytology']",1996/03/28 00:00,1996/03/28 00:01,['1996/03/28 00:00'],"['1996/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022175995002685 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(95)00268-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1996 Mar 28;190(1):91-105. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(95)00268-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a rapid, simple, reproducible, and sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens by flow cytometry. This technique involves the treatment of cell suspensions with 60 s of microwave oven heating after fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Following this treatment a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens were detected on the human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (CD68, PCNA and Ki-67), peripheral blood leukocytes from both normal donors and leukemia patients (CD68, lipocortin-1 and PCNA) and a rat mesangial cell line 1097 (desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin) using a standard indirect immunofluorescent staining with mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). There are several advantages of this technique over the routinely used methods currently available. Firstly, microwave treatment is a rapid, simple, and reproducible method, which largely reduces both time and cost expenditure, and makes this technique widely available for flow cytometric analysis in many areas of diagnostic and research purposes. Secondly, microwave treatment produces optimal results for simultaneous detection of both cytoplasmic (CD68, lipocortin-1, desmin, alpha-smooth actin) and nuclear (PCNA, Ki67) antigens. Thirdly, microwave treatment also produces a discrete profile for DNA content analysis. Finally, microwaving retains a clear discrimination between cells and debris as measured by light scatter. This study demonstrates that microwave treatment is a powerful technique which will be particularly applicable to flow cytometric analysis in the detection of many cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens.","['Lan, H Y', 'Hutchinson, P', 'Tesch, G H', 'Mu, W', 'Atkins, R C']","['Lan HY', 'Hutchinson P', 'Tesch GH', 'Mu W', 'Atkins RC']","['Department of Nephrology, Monash Medical Centre, Vic, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Desmin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A1/analysis', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'Desmin/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Microwaves', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Rats']",1996/03/28 00:00,1996/03/28 00:01,['1996/03/28 00:00'],"['1996/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022175995002332 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(95)00233-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1996 Mar 28;190(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(95)00233-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3 are microbicidal and cytotoxic defensins, initially synthesized as 94-amino acid preproHNP(1-94), cotranslationally proteolyzed to proHNP(20-94), then converted by removal of the anionic propiece to mature HNP(65-94)(HNP-1 and -3) and HNP(66-94) (HNP-2). We hypothesized that during synthesis and subcellular sorting the anionic propiece inhibits the cytotoxicity of the cationic defensin. We expressed preproHNP-1 cDNA in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells that secreted the normally transient proHNP-1(20-94) into the medium. Cyanogen bromide cleaved proHNP-1(20-94) at the fortuitously located Met64 to yield mature recombinant HNP-1(65-94) and unlinked propiece. Recombinant and native HNP-1 purified from PMN were identical as judged by mass spectrometry, retention time in reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, migration on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels, and reaction with a conformation-specific antibody. Recombinant and native HNP-1 had comparable microbicidal activity towards Listeria monocytogenes and were similarly potent in permeabilizing K562 leukemia cells, but proHNP-1(20-94) was virtually inactive in both assays. Addition of unlinked propiece (proHNP-1(20-64) with Met64-->homoserine) inhibited the bactericidal and cell-permeabilizing activity of mature HNP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Linked, and to a lesser extent unlinked, propiece interfered with the binding of HNP-1 to target cells.

Specifically, are activated receptors simply trapped on encountering preexisting coated pits, subsequently being rapidly internalized? Or do the receptors themselves, by active recruitment, gather soluble coat and cytosolic components and initiate the rapid assembly of new coated pits that then mediate their internalization? To explore this question, we studied the relationship between activation of IgE-bound high affinity Fc receptors (FCepsilonRI) and coated pit formation. Because these receptors are rapidly internalized via clathrin-coated pits only when cross-linked by the binding of multivalent antigens, we were able to separate activation from internalization by using an immobilized antigen. The FCepsilonRIs, initially uniformly distributed over the cell surface. relocalized and aggregated on the antigen-exposed membrane. The process was specific for the antigen, and temperature- and time-dependent. This stimulation initiated a cascade of cellular responses typical of FCepsilonRI signaling including membrane ruffling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and, in the presence of Ca2+, exocytosis. Despite these responses, no change in coated pit disposition or in the distribution of clathrin and assembly protein AP2 was detected, as monitored by immunoblotting and by quantitative (vertical sectioning) confocal microscopy analysis of immunofluorescently stained cells. Specifically, there was no decrease in the density of clathrin-coated pits in regions of the cell membrane not in contact with the antigen, and there was no apparent increase in clathrin-coated pits in proximity to stimulated FCepsilonRI receptors as would have been expected if the receptors were inducing formation of new pits by active recruitment. These results indicate that de novo formation of clathrin-coated pits is not a prerequisite for rapid internalization or a direct response to stimulation of FCepsilonRI receptors. Therefore, increases in coated pits reported to occur in response to activation of some signaling receptors must be consequences of the signal transduction processes, rather than strictly serving the purpose of the internalization of the receptors.","['Santini, F', 'Keen, J H']","['Santini F', 'Keen JH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 2', 'Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/*metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.132.6.1025 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Mar;132(6):1025-36. doi: 10.1083/jcb.132.6.1025.,,,,"['5-T32-CA09678/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM28526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2120763,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase is due to a broadening of the indications for transplantation and an increase in the donor pool. There has been a progressive improvement in outcome particularly due to a fall in transplant-related mortality. Methotrexate and cyclosporin are the mainstay of graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but acute GVHD remains a major problem in the unrelated donor recipient. Infections remain an important cause of death and emphasise the crucial role of antimicrobial prophylaxis; death from Gram-negative sepsis has been significantly reduced by the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Fungal infections carry a high mortality, especially in allogenic transplant recipients. Fluconazole is used to protect patients in the neutropenic period and beyond in higher risk individuals. Viral infections, which may occur late, are emerging as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the allogeneic, particularly unrelated transplantation setting. A long term susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria suggests delayed immune reconstitution; revaccination policies are standard in most units. The longer term effects of transplantation are increasingly important with improving survival and include chronic GVHD, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other systemic abnormalities. The increased risk of secondary malignancies is also of concern.","['Hunter, A E', 'Haynes, A P', 'Russell, N H']","['Hunter AE', 'Haynes AP', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/prevention & control', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Mycoses/etiology/prevention & control', 'Pneumocystis Infections/etiology/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Virus Diseases/etiology/prevention & control']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/36.suppl_b.119 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1995 Oct;36 Suppl B:119-33. doi: 10.1093/jac/36.suppl_b.119.,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have investigated the effect of the Pall LG6 and control AV6 filters during simulated in vitro cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Various parameters were evaluated including neutrophils, total leucocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets, expression of antigens on neutrophils using a panel of leucocyte-associated monoclonal antibodies CD13, 14, 15, 45Ro, 67, 11a, 11b and L selectin. The effects of leucocyte stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and a leucocyte bolus from a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were also investigated. We have demonstrated that the LG6 significantly reduces leucocytes, in particular neutrophils, with a modest reduction of lymphocytes, platelets and haematocrit, whereas the AV6 had no effect on leukocytes or neutrophils in the test system. In addition the LG6 was associated with a reduction in expression of all leucocyte antigens by approximately 20%; however there was no appreciable alteration of any of the antigens with AV6. Leucocyte stimulation with PMA resulted in a dramatic decrease of all cellular elements and an extra leucocyte load (using CML leucocytes) was not effectively filtered by the LG6 filter.

Varying amounts of ACPI-positive cells were present in the mixed B- and T-cell-type and also in the T-cell-type lesions. The labeled cell population was distinct from the factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes, S-100-positive histiocytes, and HAM 56-positive histiocytes. Malignant lymphomas contained a few haphazardly arranged ACPI-positive cells with short dendrites and granular cytoplasm. It was concluded that follicular dendritic cells can be reliably labeled with ACPI antiserum in cutaneous pseudolymphomas. The structure and distribution of ACPI-containing cells in malignant cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is altered when compared with pseudolymphomas.","['Aho, H J', 'Ping, W', 'Soderstrom, K O', 'Rinne, A', 'Rinne, R', 'Hopsu-Havu, V K']","['Aho HJ', 'Ping W', 'Soderstrom KO', 'Rinne A', 'Rinne R', 'Hopsu-Havu VK']","['Department of Pathology, University of Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cystatins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (HAM-56 antibody)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/analysis', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Cystatins/*analysis/genetics', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*analysis/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histiocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'S100 Proteins/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transglutaminases/analysis']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-199504000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 1995 Apr;17(2):115-25. doi: 10.1097/00000372-199504000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first group was melanomas inadvertently transmitted from donors. Brain metastases from melanoma were often misdiagnosed in the donors as primary brain tumors or cerebral hemorrhage. Eleven donors provided organs to 20 recipients of whom 3 never manifested evidence of melanoma, 1 showed local spread of tumor beyond the allograft, and 16 had metastases. Of the last group 11 died from melanoma, but 4 patients had complete remissions following transplant nephrectomy and discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. The second group was Melanomas treated pretransplantation. Thirty patients had cutaneous melanomas and one an ocular melanoma. Six patients (19%) had recurrences posttransplantation. Three were treated < 2 years pretransplantation, 2 between 2-5 years pretransplantation, and one 120 months pretransplantation. The third group was De novo melanomas. Cutaneous melanomas occurred in 164 patients, melanomas of unknown origin in 8, and ocular melanomas in 5. Melanomas constituted 5.2% of posttransplant skin cancers compared with 2.7% in the general population. Unusual features of cutaneous melanomas were that 6 (4%) occurred in children, and 9 (5%) occurred in bone marrow recipients who were treated for leukemia. Forty-four patients (27%) who had cutaneous melanomas also had other skin cancers. Forty-seven of 68 patients (69%) had thick skin lesions (Clark's level III or greater or > 0.76 mm by Breslow's technique). Lymph node metastases occurred in 32 patients (20%) with cutaneous melanomas. Fifty patients (30%) with cutaneous melanomas died of their malignancies, as did 5 with melanomas of unknown origin, and 1 with ocular melanoma. The risks of melanoma may be reduced by stringent selection of donors; by waiting at least 5 years between treatment of melanoma and undertaking transplantation; and, perhaps, by reducing sunlight exposure and by early excision of suspicious dysplastic lesions.","['Penn, I']",['Penn I'],"['Department of Surgery University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Melanoma/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/01/27 00:00,1996/01/27 00:01,['1996/01/27 00:00'],"['1996/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199601270-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1996 Jan 27;61(2):274-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199601270-00019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All eight proteins (Hoxb-1-Hoxb-8) bind to a target oligonucleotide in the presence of Pbx1a under conditions where minimal or no binding is detected for the Hox or Pbx1a proteins alone. The stabilities of the Hox-Pbx1a-DNA complexes vary >100-fold, with the proteins from the middle of the locus (Hoxb-5 and Hoxb-6) forming very stable complexes, while Hoxb-4, Hoxb-7 and Hoxb-8 form complexes of intermediate stability and proteins at the 3'-side of the locus (Hoxb-1-Hoxb-3) form complexes which are very unstable. Although Hox-b proteins containing longer linker sequences between the hexapeptide and homeodomains formed unstable complexes, shortening the linker did not confer complex stability. Homeodomain swapping experiments revealed that this motif does not independently determine complex stability. Naturally occurring variations within the hexapeptides of specific Hox proteins also do not explain complex stability differences. However, two core amino acids (tryptophan and methionine) which are absolutely conserved within the hexapeptide domains appear to be required for complex formation. Removal of N- and C-terminal flanking regions did not influence complex stability and the members of paralog group 4 (Hoxa-4, b-4, c-4 and d-4), which share highly conserved hexapeptides, linkers and homeodomains but different flanking regions, form complexes of similar stability. These data suggest that the structural features of Hox proteins which determine Hox-Pbx1a-DNA complex stability reside within the precise structural relationships between the homeodomain, hexapeptide and linker regions.","['Shen, W F', 'Chang, C P', 'Rozenfeld, S', 'Sauvageau, G', 'Humphries, R K', 'Lu, M', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Cleary, M L', 'Largman, C']","['Shen WF', 'Chang CP', 'Rozenfeld S', 'Sauvageau G', 'Humphries RK', 'Lu M', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Cleary ML', 'Largman C']","['Department of Medicine San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['5e0669 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/24.5.898 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Mar 1;24(5):898-906. doi: 10.1093/nar/24.5.898.,,,,"['CA42971,MLC/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N44DK-3-2219,CL/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC145726,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incense burning is possibly associated with elevated risks of leukemia and brain tumor in children from the epidemiological studies. Thus, evaluation of the genotoxicity of smoke condensates from incense burning is needed. We examined the genotoxicity of incense smoke condensates (ISC) using the Ames test in S. typhimurium strains with different mutagenic specificity and level of metabolic enzyme, the SOS chromotest in E. coli PQ37, and sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells (SCE/CHO). The genotoxicity of environmental tobacco smoke condensates (TSC) was also evaluated by the three assays to compare with the genotoxicity of ISC. ISC showed a positive response in TA98, but not in TA100. It suggested that ISC only contained frame shift mutagens. The mutagenicity of ISC in both strains of TA98NR with deficient nitroreductase and TA98/1,8-DNP6 with deficient O-acetyltransferase was markedly decreased compared to that in TA98 strain. However, the mutagenicity was enhanced in YG1024 with overexpression of O-acetyltransferase activity. Thus, nitroarenes seemed to be responsible in part for the mutagenicity of ISC. Interestingly, all of the four ISC and two TSC samples showed a dose-dependent genotoxic response in the SOS chromotest with E. coli PQ37 but a low SCE induction of those samples were observed in CHO cells. When the genotoxicity was analyzed based on the condensates per one gram of original samples, the genotoxicity of two TSC condensates in prokaryotic cells was higher than that of four ISC samples except for the genotoxicity of TSC-2 in TA98 strain. However, the genotoxicity of certain ISC in eukaryotic cells based on the SCE/CHO assay was higher than that of TSC. To compare the covalent binding of DNA reactive intermediates of ISC and TSC to S. typhimurium TA98, the DNA adducts were evaluated by the 32P-postlabeling method with butanol extraction version. Similar diagonal radioactive zone (DRZ) was observed between ISC and CSC. However, DNA adduct levels induced by TSC were much greater than that of ISC.","['Chen, C C', 'Lee, H']","['Chen CC', 'Lee H']","['Environmental Toxicological Center, Chung Shan Medical & Dental College, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Smoke)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', 'EC 1.7.- (Nitroreductases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/toxicity', '*Mutation', 'Nitroreductases/metabolism', 'Plants, Toxic', 'SOS Response, Genetics', 'Salmonella typhimurium/genetics/metabolism', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(95)00067-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(95)00067-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1996 Mar 1;367(3):105-14. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(95)00067-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach to this question is through twin concordance studies, but only the most common malignancy, acute leukemia, has been studied to date, owing to the rarity of other forms of childhood cancer. The aim of the study was to determine the concordance rates for childhood cancer in twins, in order to clarify the importance of constitutional predisposition for a range of tumor types. Twins with cancer were ascertained through three cooperative clinical trials groups, a cancer-twin registry, and a large pediatric hospital. Subjects were sent a postal questionnaire requesting information on cancer concordance and zygosity. Data were obtained on 556 twins with cancer. Three twin pairs, out of 197 twin pairs (76 monozygous, MZ, twin pairs), were concordant for leukemia, giving an MZ case-wise concordance rate (5%) that is substantially lower than previously reported. The case-wise concordance for non-retinoblastoma solid tumors was 2.2%: Two twin pairs were concordant for CNS tumors, one was concordant for neuroblastoma, and two twin pairs were concordant for cancer but not for the type of cancer. The results of the present study, together with previous data from population studies of siblings and offspring, suggest that there is not in general a strong constitutional genetic component for childhood cancers other than retinoblastoma.","['Buckley, J D', 'Buckley, C M', 'Breslow, N E', 'Draper, G J', 'Roberson, P K', 'Mack, T M']","['Buckley JD', 'Buckley CM', 'Breslow NE', 'Draper GJ', 'Roberson PK', 'Mack TM']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Diseases in Twins', 'Environmental Health', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', 'Registries', 'Retinoblastoma/genetics', 'Risk Factors', '*Twins', 'Twins, Dizygotic', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",1996/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199604)26:4<223::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199604)26:4<223::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Apr;26(4):223-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199604)26:4<223::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-L.,,,,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04CA01152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why only certain HTLV-I infections lead to acute ATLL, which is characterized by leukemic infiltration of multiple organs and immune suppression, remains unknown. A readily accessible animal model in which the spectrum of consequences resulting from HTLV-I infection can be observed would greatly aid studies of this retrovirus. New Zealand White rabbits inoculated with either HTLV-1-infected CD25+ T cells or cell-free virus, were serially necropsied at different intervals after death or humane sacrifice. Tissues were preserved at necropsy or cultured in vitro and subsequently prepared for morphologic or molecular examination. Rabbits inoculated with RH/K34, a productively infected rabbit T cell line that contains a monoclonally integrated full-length HTLV-I provirus, developed acute ATLL-like biologically malignant lymphoproliferative disease with lymphocyte infiltration of viscera; lymphomas consisting primarily of monoclonal expansions of RH/K34 manifested a variety of diffuse pleomorphic histologic types. Concurrently, lymphoproliferative disease was associated with onset of thymic atrophy in the presence of rapidly increasing thymic proviral load. In contrast, rabbits given two other HTLV-1 inocula, originally derived (as was RH/K34) using the human T cell line MT-2 as virus source, also became infected but did not develop thymic atrophy or the ATLL-like disease. HTLV-1 infection, thymic atrophy, and leukemic infiltration similar to acute ATLL occurred reproducibly in a New Zealand White rabbit model independent of RH/K34 inoculum and host histocompatibility. Thymic atrophy in RH/K34-inoculated rabbits, but not in rabbits given other similar HTLV-1, was consistent with immunosuppression sufficient to prevent rejection of the inoculum. Although the short, 8-day course of the experimental ATLL precludes its having a molecular pathogenesis identical to the human condition, the systemic consequences of acute ATLL, including its association with thymic atrophy, are closely modeled.","['Simpson, R M', 'Zhao, T M', 'Hubbard, B S', 'Sawasdikosol, S', 'Kindt, T J']","['Simpson RM', 'Zhao TM', 'Hubbard BS', 'Sawasdikosol S', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Rabbits', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/*pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1996 Mar;74(3):696-710.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the oral and histopathologic findings in these patients. Such a study would aid in understanding the early development of subsequent progression of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with hematologic malignancies who developed invasive oral aspergillosis were studied. The condition was divided into three stages according to the oral findings at the time biopsy procedures were performed. Tissue sections from biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic study and the findings were evaluated in relation to the oral findings. Fungal cultures of biopsy specimens were also performed to confirm the causative organisms. RESULTS: The diagnosis of oral aspergillosis was established in terms of both histologic and microbiologic evidence in all 12 patients. In the early stage (three patients), isolated areas of violaceous marginal gingiva consisted of degenerated epithelium and connective tissue infiltrated by fungal hyphae. In the advanced stage (four patients), the violaceous marginal gingiva had become transformed into gray necrotic lesions that extended to the attached gingiva. The necrotic lesions showed ulceration and were covered by a pseudomembrane containing fungal hyphae. At the base of the ulcers, connective tissue was occupied by proliferating fungal hyphae, with vascular invasion being observed. In the late stage (five patients), the ulcerated lesions had progressed, showing destruction of the alveolar bone and surrounding facial muscles, with infiltration of fungal hyphae unto the tissues. No inflammatory cellular reaction was observed until the hematologic status of the patients improved. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that invasive oral aspergillosis has three distinctive clinicopathological stages. Recognition of the different stages of invasive Aspergillus infections is helpful for correct diagnosis of the disease.","['Myoken, Y', 'Sugata, T', 'Kyo, T I', 'Fujihara, M']","['Myoken Y', 'Sugata T', 'Kyo TI', 'Fujihara M']","['Hiroshima Red Corss-Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Oral Maxillofac Surg,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,8206428,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*microbiology/*pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0278239196000547 [pii]', '10.1016/s0278-2391(96)90737-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 1996 Mar;54(3):263-70. doi: 10.1016/s0278-2391(96)90737-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heterogeneity is evident in both the shape and latency of the responses. Mast cells within a single microscopic field of view, which have experienced identical culture conditions and experimental preparation, display a wide variety of responses upon antigen stimulation. We have subcloned the RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cell line to test the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity within the population is the cause of the Ca2+ response heterogeneity. We found that cell-to-cell variability was significantly reduced in four of five clonal lines. The response heterogeneity remaining within the clones was not an experimental artifact caused by differences in the amount of fura-2 loaded by individual cells. Factors other than genetic heterogeneity must partly account for Ca2+ response heterogeneity. It is possible that the complex shapes and variability of the Ca2+ responses are reflections of the fact that there are multiple factors underlying the Ca2-response to antigen stimulation. Small differences from cell to cell in one or more of these factors could be a cause of the remaining Ca2+ response heterogeneity.","['Kuchtey, J', 'Fewtrell, C']","['Kuchtey J', 'Fewtrell C']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (dinitrophenyl gamma globulin)', '0 (gamma-Globulins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Globulins']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<643::AID-JCP20>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<643::AID-JCP20>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):643-52. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<643::AID-JCP20>3.0.CO;2-6.,,,,['GM08210/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of extracellular ATP (50-500 microM) to both normal and leukemic lymphocytes caused loss of binding of monoclonal antibodies to L-selectin (CD62L) on the cell surface. UTP, ADP, and adenosine (all at 500 microM) had no effect on L-selectin expression. Several features of the ATP-induced loss of L selectin indicate that this effect is mediated by lymphocyte P2Z purinoceptors. First the loss was attenuated in isotonic NaCl medium compared to 150 mM KCl medium. Second the loss of L-selectin was immediately halted by addition of Mg2+ ions in molar excess of ATP. The most potent nucleotide causing L-selectin loss was benzoylbenzoic ATP (> 10 microM) which is also the most potent agonist for the P2Z purinoceptor. Finally preincubation of lymphocytes with oxidized ATP, an irreversible inhibitor of P2Z purinoceptors, also inhibited ATP induced loss of L-selectin. Extracellular ATP is known to open an ion channel associated with the P2Z purinoceptor on B-lymphocytes which allows influx of Ca2+. However, ATP-induced loss of L-selectin did not require extracellular Ca2+. Moreover addition of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, had minimal effect on L-selectin expression. Staurosporine (500 nM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibited only 10% of ATP induced loss of L-selectin but completely inhibited the loss of L-selectin caused by 50 nM PMA. Thus extracellular ATP interacts with lymphocyte P2Z purinoceptors which leads to shedding of L-selectin via a pathway which requires neither Ca2+ influx nor activation of protein kinase C. ATP may have a physiological role in the loss of L-selectin which occurs during the interactions of lymphocytes with other cells.","['Jamieson, G P', 'Snook, M B', 'Thurlow, P J', 'Wiley, J S']","['Jamieson GP', 'Snook MB', 'Thurlow PJ', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Haematology, Austin Campus, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', ""4P5DXU1F8Q (3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate)"", ""54970-91-1 (2',3'-dialdehyde ATP)"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<637::AID-JCP19>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<637::AID-JCP19>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):637-42. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<637::AID-JCP19>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years hematopoietic growth factors have been used to recruit myeloid leukemia blasts into the proliferative phase of the cell cycle and as supportive agents, both with cytotoxic regimens and in the setting of bone marrow transplantation. This approach prompted us to investigate whether myeloid growth factors have a role in Ph1 positive ALL. To do this, we utilized two newly established Ph1-positive cell lines, Z-119 and Z-181. Both lines have L2 morphology, ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts and typical B-lineage surface markers identical to those observed in the two Ph1-positive ALL patients from whom they were derived. In addition, a single rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH) band was found in both cell lines by Southern blot analysis, confirming B-cell clonality. Cytogenetic analysis of the two lines revealed t(9;22). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified cDNA from both Z-119 and Z-181 cells revealed an e1--a2 BCR-ABL junction, and p190BCR-ABL protein was detected in them by the immune complex kinase assay. Both cell lines produce interleukin (IL)-1 beta, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but neither IL-1 beta, G-CSF, their corresponding antibodies and inhibitory molecules, nor GM-CSF, affected the cell lines' growth. However, GM-CSF neutralizing antibodies inhibited Z-181 but not Z-119 colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion by up to 77% and addition of GM-SCF reversed this inhibitory effect. Receptor studies with radiolabeled GM-CSF demonstrated specific binding to Z-181 but not to Z-119 cells, and Scatchard analysis revealed that Z-181 cells express high-affinity GM-CSF receptors. Furthermore, PCR analysis showed that Z-181 but not Z-119 bears the transcript for the GM-CSF receptor. Finally, studies using PH1-positive ALL patients' marrow cells revealed similar data. In 3 of 8 samples we detected significant concentrations of GM-CSF (7.5-13 pg/2 x 10(7) cells) and in 2 of 3 cases GM-CSF significantly stimulated Ph1-positive ALL colony proliferation. These data suggest that Ph1-positive ALL cells may produce GM-CSF, express GM-CSF receptors and thus show a proliferative response to this cytokine.","['Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Zipf, T F', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Ku, S', 'Ouspenskaia, M V', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Huh, Y', 'Yee, G', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Zipf TF', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ku S', 'Ouspenskaia MV', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Huh Y', 'Yee G', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Division of Medicine, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<618::AID-JCP17>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<618::AID-JCP17>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):618-30. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<618::AID-JCP17>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,['P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize nucleoside transport in acute promyelocytic NB4 cells, nucleoside transport was resolved into different components by selective elimination of transport processes with NBMPR and with Na+-deficient media. Initial transport rates were estimated from time course experiments. For adenosine, uridine, and formycin B, equilibrative transport accounted for approximately 60% of their uptake, with ei and es transport contributing almost equally, and Na+-dependent transport accounting for the remaining 40% of the total uptake. Thymidine uptake was mediated exclusively by equilibrative systems with ei and es systems each contributing 50% to total uptake. Adenosine accumulated above equilibrative concentrations, suggesting that a concentrative transport process was active and/or that metabolism led to adenosine's accumulation. Formycin B, a nonmetabolizable analog, also accumulated in the cells, supporting the concentrative potential of the Na+-dependent transporter. Kinetic analyses also provided evidence for three distinct high affinity transport mechanisms. NBMPR binding assays indicated the presence of two high affinity (Km 0.10 and 0.35 nM) binding sites. In conclusion, NB4 cells express ei and es transport, as well as a large ci transport component, which appears to correspond to cif (f=formycin B or purine selective) nucleoside transport, not previously described in human cells.","['Roovers, K I', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Roovers KI', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*physiology', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<593::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<593::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):593-600. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<593::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA damaging agents such as ionizing or UV radiation, and some chemical agents induce WAF1 in wild-type p53 containing cells, thereby halting cell cycle progression. WAF1 expression is also induced through a p53-independent pathway. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a cytotoxic/cytostatic compound for some human cancer cells. We examined a series of myeloid leukemic cell lines that expressed either no p53 (HL-60, K562) or mutant inactive p53 (KG-1, KCL22,THP-1, U937). The KG-1, HL-60, K562, and KCL22 myeloid leukemic cells increased their levels of WAF1 mRNA in the presence of TNF alpha. We focused on KG-1 cells to determine how TNF alpha modulated WAF1 expression. WAF1 mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cells after exposure to increasing concentrations of TNF alpha, and this increase occurred in the absence of new protein synthesis. An increase of WAF1 protein and a concominant decrease of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity also was found in KG-1 cells. Flow cytometry using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine showed an increase in the proportion of TNF alpha- treated KG-1 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. TNF alpha enhanced the rate of WAF1 transcription only 1.4 fold in TNF alpha-treated KG-1 cells as compared to untreated cells. Notably, however, the half-life (t 1/2) of WAF1 mRNA in TNF alpha-treated cells was 2.5 hours as compared to 0.5 hours in untreated cells. These results indicate that TNF alpha increases WAF1 levels at least in part via a postttranscriptional stabilization of the mRNA; and TNF alpha may mediate its cytostatic effects through WAF1 in some cell types.","['Shiohara, M', 'Akashi, M', 'Gombart, A F', 'Yang, R', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Shiohara M', 'Akashi M', 'Gombart AF', 'Yang R', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<568::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<568::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):568-76. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<568::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mcl-1 gene product proved to be a member of the bcl-2 gene family and, like bcl-2, to have the capacity to promote cell viability. The pattern of expression of mcl-1 has now been characterized, the aim being to determine whether increased expression is consistently associated with differentiation-induction and whether expression is also associated with other changes in proliferative state or cell viability. Expression of the mcl-1 mRNA was found to increase rapidly in ML-1 cells exposed to inducers of monocyte/macrophage differentiation (phorbol esters or lymphocyte conditioned medium), but not cells exposed to an inducer of granulocyte differentiation (retinoic acid). Expression also increased rapidly in response to certain cytotoxic agents (colchicine and vinblastine), but did not increase during serum stimulation or growth-arrest in reduced serum. Increased expression of mcl-1 occurred during the initiation of cell differentiation or death and was not inhibited by cycloheximide, in agreement with the designation of mcl-1 as an early-induction gene. Increased transcription contributed to the increase in expression, and turnover of the mcl-1 mRNA was rapid. These findings suggest that mcl-1 may serve as a modulator of cell viability that can undergo rapid upregulation as well as downregulation, with upregulation harbingering the initiation of cell differentiation or death.","['Yang, T', 'Buchan, H L', 'Townsend, K J', 'Craig, R W']","['Yang T', 'Buchan HL', 'Townsend KJ', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood', 'Cell Death', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<523::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<523::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Mar;166(3):523-36. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199603)166:3<523::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sites of involvement included lower extremity (seven), upper extremity (six), chest wall (three), gluteal region (two), and frontal subgaleal region (one). Histological and immunophenotypic studies revealed 12 large cell lymphomas (11 B cell and one T cell), two small noncleaved cell lymphomas (B-cell phenotype), and five low grade B-cell lymphomas (two small lymphocytic and three follicular mixed lymphomas). Patients with large cell lymphoma, including seven patients with stages I and II and five patients with stage IV, were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy. One half of these patients are dead of disease, including four of seven with low stage disease. The two patients with small noncleaved cell lymphoma had stage IE disease and were treated with chemotherapy; one died at 11 months, and the other is alive and disease free at 65 months. Patients with low grade B-cell lymphoma included four stage IE patients who were treated with radiation and one stage IV patient treated with chemotherapy. Two patients are alive and disease free, and three are dead of unrelated causes. The authors conclude that malignant lymphomas initially diagnosed in soft tissues are most commonly large cell lymphomas with a B-cell phenotype.","['Salamao, D R', 'Nascimento, A G', 'Lloyd, R V', 'Chen, M G', 'Habermann, T M', 'Strickler, J G']","['Salamao DR', 'Nascimento AG', 'Lloyd RV', 'Chen MG', 'Habermann TM', 'Strickler JG']","['Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(96)90065-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90065-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1996 Mar;27(3):253-7. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90065-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis revealed a 25% decrease by AZT in GATA-1 mRNA steady-state levels at 24 h and this inhibitory effect was maintained until 72 h after drug addition. A similar decrease in NFE-2 mRNA steady-state levels was observed at 72 h after AZT treatment. This study suggests that AZT inhibition of erythroid differentiation is subsequent to a decrease of nuclear factors gene expression which affect their DNA binding.","['Bridges, E G', 'Trentesaux, C', 'Lahlil, R', 'Spiga, M G', 'Jeannesson, P', 'Sommadossi, J P']","['Bridges EG', 'Trentesaux C', 'Lahlil R', 'Spiga MG', 'Jeannesson P', 'Sommadossi JP']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for AIDS Research and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zalcitabine/pharmacology', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00296.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jan-Feb;56(1-2):62-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00296.x.,,,,['AI-33239/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate possible reasons for this diversity a starvation experiment, based upon prolongation of medium exchange, was set up in the multidrug resistant cell line CEM/VBL100. DNR accumulation (1 microgram/ml) was measured flow cytometrically in the presence or absence of Verapamil (10 micromol/l). In cells permanently kept under ideal growth conditions, addition of Verapamil resulted in an average 90% increase in DNR enhancement in five successive experiments. In contrast, DNR accumulation increased by only 26% when the medium exchange was prolonged by 30 h to 42 h. This effect was not accompanied by changes in the MDR1 gene expression at the RNA or protein level. Consequently, 53 leukaemic blast samples of 30 newly diagnosed and 18 relapsed or refractory patients with acute leukaemia (ALL-18, AML-37) were processed without any delay and under the most stringent conditions possible. Evidence of the classical MDR phenotype was arbitrarily defined by a greater than 20% enhancement in DNR accumulation in response to Verapamil (10 micromol/l) or Cyclosporin A (3 micromol/l). Using this cutoff point for analysis of newly diagnosed leukaemia we found DNR uptake better correlated to response to treatment (p = 0.002) than P-gp detection by means of immunocytochemistry, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (p = 0.03). We conclude that DNR accumulation studies are a sensitive method for predicting therapy outcome in acute leukaemia when performed with necessary precautions.","['Hegewisch-Becker, S', 'Faltz, C', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Hegewisch-Becker S', 'Faltz C', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Medical University Clinic of Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0S726V972K (Nimustine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV protocol']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nimustine/administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00287.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jan-Feb;56(1-2):12-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00287.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the effect of cytostatic drugs we have tried, prior to treatment in vitro, to recruit tumor cells from G0 with growth factors. Leukemic cells from the bone marrows of 26 patients with AML and CML in blast crisis were incubated with G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3 for 24 h prior to incubation with cytostatic drugs. The cells were incubated with mitoxantrone, etoposide or daunorubicin for 1 h, or with Ara-C continuously. Prior to treatment, 4 patients with AML received GM-CSF for 24 h, after which blast cells from bone marrow were incubated with cytostatic drugs. After incubation with the cytostatic drugs, cells were cultured in a suspension culture for 4 d. The drug effect was determined with a bioluminescence ATP method. Leukemic cells were significantly stimulated by all three cytokines compared to an untreated control. GM-CSF and IL-3 increased the amount of cells 3- to 4-fold and G-CSF increased the amount 3 times compared to untreated cells. G-CSF significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide and Ara-C by 20-40%, which GM-CSF and IL-3 showed a significantly increased toxicity for Ara-C only. Although the cytokines induced a higher percentage of cells killed with the cytostatic drugs, proliferation of the remaining cells resulted in an increased total number of cells from 1.5 to 3 times compared to the unstimulated incubations. We conclude that cytokines induce a higher level of toxicity of cytostatic drugs on leukemic cells, but the increased proliferation of the remaining cells may offset the clinical benefit.","['Sundman-Engberg, B', 'Tidefelt, U', 'Paul, C']","['Sundman-Engberg B', 'Tidefelt U', 'Paul C']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Insitutet, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/toxicity']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00285.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jan-Feb;56(1-2):1-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00285.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied AP-1/NF-E2 motifs from three different erythroid control elements (5'HS2 of the human beta-globin locus control region [LCR], the porphobilinogen deaminase [PBGD] promoter, and the mouse Band 3 promoter). We find that these AP-1/NF-E2 elements differ both in their ability to bind NF-E2 and their activity in transient assays. Each of the elements is bound by AP-1, but only the 5'HS2 and PBGD sites are bound by NF-E2. We examined the activity of these sites in minimal promoter constructs in transient assays. In erythroid cells, activity of duplicated NF-E2 motifs is positively correlated with binding by NF-E2; however, the Band 3 element not bound by NF-E2 is also active in some contexts. In HeLa cells, all sites were active and duplicated sites were most active. In F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells, which express neither NF-E2 nor AP-1, the elements' activity parallels that in erythroid cells. While these finding are consistent with other evidence that NF-E2 is an important regulator of erythroid transcription, they suggest that some sites that resemble NF-E2 elements are actually regulated by other factors; we speculate that other tissue-specific and/or generally expressed factors may act on these sites.","['Walters, M', 'Andrews, N C', 'Magis, W', 'Martin, D I']","['Walters M', 'Andrews NC', 'Magis W', 'Martin DI']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rabbits', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(3):445-52.,,,,['R01 HL48790/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythroblasts from the spleens of mice infected with the anemia strain of Friend virus (FVA cells) were studied. Erythropoietin stimulated phosphorylation of eIF-4E in FVA cells within 30 minutes, and this effect was maximal at 60 minutes. Phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic phosphopeptide map analysis of eIF-4E isolated from both control and erythropoietin-treated cells identified a predominant phosphopeptide containing phosphoserine. However, when cells were incubated with 1 muM okadaic acid, eIF-4E was phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues and three additional tryptic phosphopeptides were detected. We also identified a 37-kD phosphoprotein (pp37) that bound specifically to the m7GTP cap structure and coimmunoprecipitated with eIF-kD protein was phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues. These results indicate that phosphorylation of eIF-4E is a target in erythropoietin-initiated signal transduction events and that this phosphorylation precedes observable effects of erythropoietin on macromolecular biosynthesis.

The neoplastic LGL of this patient mediated natural killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and exhibited proliferative responses similar to normal CD16+CD56dim natural killer (NK) cells. The Morphology of NKL cells resembles that of normal activated NK cells. The karyotype of NKL is 47, XY, add (1) (q42), +6 del (6) (q15 q23), del (17) (p11). NKL cells express CD2, CD6, CD11a, CD26, CD27, CD29, CD38, CD43, CD58, CD81, CD94, CD95, class II MHC, and the C1.7.1 antigen, but do not express detectable levels of CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD28, alpha/beta or gamma/delta T cell receptors on the cell surface. The density of the CD16, CD56, and CD57 antigens declined markedly on NKL cells during prolonged im vitro culture. Nevertheless, NKL cells can mediate ADCC as well as natural killing. NKL cells are strictly dependent on interleukin-2 (IL-2) for sustained growth and die if deprived of IL-2 for more than 7 days. NKL cells proliferate in response to concentrations of IL-2 as low as 1 pM, but an optimal proliferative response requires approximately 100 pM IL-2. NKL cells growing in the presence of IL-2 express abundant IL-2R alpha with little or no detectable IL-2 beta or gamma chain on the cell surface; NKL cells deprived of IL-2 express high levels of both IL-2R alpha and beta. IL-4, IL-7, and IL-12, unlike IL-2, do not maintain the viability of NKL cells. Furthermore, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma do not support the growth of NKL cells.

Maintenance of high levels of GSH in normal tissues is believed to be important in the prevention of drug-induced toxicity. Previous studies have indicated that exposure of cells to some toxic electrophiles both in vitro and in vivo can cause a temporary decrease in intracellular levels of GSH. In this paper we report that in a series of 22 children and young adults treated with high dose melphalan (ten courses studied, all 200 mg/m2), cisplatin (eight courses, 80-104 mg/m2) or carboplatin (seven courses, 507-750 mg/m2) there was no significant alteration in the level of plasma, erythrocyte or urine GSH in the period immediately following drug administration. Fluctuations in the level of GSH in mononuclear cells were observed in some patients but did not follow any consistent pattern and were similar to those observed in a series of nine normal adult controls over the same time course. These results suggest that for melphalan, cisplatin and carboplatin, drug-GSH adduct formation is insufficient to cause a measurable decrease in intracellular GSH levels in normal peripheral haematopoietic cells during the course of treatment.","['Hogarth, L', 'English, M', 'Price, L', 'Wyllie, R', 'Pearson, A D', 'Hall, A G']","['Hogarth L', 'English M', 'Price L', 'Wyllie R', 'Pearson AD', 'Hall AG']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Laboratory, Medical School, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Glutathione/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050415 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;37(5):479-85. doi: 10.1007/s002800050415.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) after a 2-h exposure to the drug are: CH1, 2.5 microM; CH1cisR, 7.5 microM; and SKOV-3, 33 microM. Despite the variation in sensitivity, the amount of Pt bound to DNA and the rate of removal of Pt was similar for the three lines. There were significant differences in the rates of formation of DNA cross-links but these were not large enough to account for the high resistance of the SKOV-3 line. We have reported that in the L1210 murine leukaemia cell line there are two mechanisms of cisplatin-induced cell death - one of which involves apoptosis. In this paper, we report on an investigation into whether sensitivity to apoptosis played a role in the resistance of these ovarian lines toward cisplatin. After a 2-h incubation with the drug, cells from the three lines showed evidence of death through apoptosis. The cells detached from the culture dish in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. These cells morphologically were quite distinctive from the attached cells and showed changes in their chromatin structure indicative of apoptosis. Their DNA had not been degraded into oligonucleosomal fragments (200 bp and multiples thereof) but had been cut into larger fragments (30 kilobase pairs, kbp) of a size associated with chromatin domains (chromatin loops). At equitoxic doses of drug, the quantity of cells undergoing apoptosis was similar for the three cell lines. The most prominent effect on cell-cycle kinetics was a slowdown in S-phase transit during which the cells underwent apoptosis. Cells that successfully completed the S phase subsequently suffered a temporary G2 block. We propose that the sensitivity of these cell lines to cisplatin was governed by their ability to handle damage caused by platination of the DNA and that the major mechanism of cisplatin-induced cell death in all three cell lines was the induction of apoptosis.","['Ormerod, M G', ""O'Neill, C"", 'Robertson, D', 'Kelland, L R', 'Harrap, K R']","['Ormerod MG', ""O'Neill C"", 'Robertson D', 'Kelland LR', 'Harrap KR']","['Cancer Research Campaign Centre For Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050413 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;37(5):463-71. doi: 10.1007/s002800050413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the effect of FaraAMP on NK cells in CLL, we analyzed NKa toward K562 targets after in vitro incubation with FaraAMP and after in vivo exposure to fludarabine. Pretreatment analysis of peripheral blood from 12 CLL patients (9 untreated) revealed: median number of NK cells 500/microliter (range 290-1160); median NKa lytic unit30/10(6) cells (range 5-80). These results were similar to those from healthy adult donors. After exposure to 3, 30 or 300 microM FaraAMP, the median maximum stimulation index (NKa FaraAMP/NKa) was 1.2 (range 0.9-1.5), within the range observed in normal adults. FaraA also stimulated NKa in vitro toward autologous CLL cells in two of five patients as measured by a dye-exclusion assay. In three patients following three or more treatment courses of fludarabine (30 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) the NK cell number and NKa were maintained near pretreatment values. Phenotypic analysis of the peripheral mononuclear cells in 34 consecutive CLL patients revealed a marked reduction in CD5/CD20 and CD4 cell numbers after three courses of fludarabine with less effect on CD8 and CD56 cells.

YT2C2 cells express CD28 antigen and kill B7-expressing targets by a CD28-mediated mechanism which is inhibited by anti-CD28 mAb (CD28.2). The lysis of B7-negative targets, which are also killed by YT2C2, is insensitive to CD28.2, but can be inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). CsA reduces degranulation in YT2C2 as measured by BLT-esterase release assays. A total suppression of B7-negative cell lysis was observed in the presence of EGTA, which blocks both degranulation and perforin polymerization, confirming that lysis of this type of target depends solely upon granule exocytosis. In contrast, an additional extracellular EGTA-resistant component in B7-positive target killing was evidenced. These results were consistently obtained with a panel of B7-positive and B7-negative targets, including a Jurkat subclone transfected to express B7 and its parental cell line. Ca2+-independent killing was completed during the first hour of the cytotoxicity assay, whereas EGTA-sensitive lysis increased throughout the whole incubation time. These two lytic mechanisms used by YT2C2 were found to induce two different modes of cell death. Extracellular Ca2+-dependent killing caused apoptotic death in both B7-positive and B7-negative targets, whereas the EGTA-resistant cytolytic pathway, observed exclusively with B7-positive targets, led to necrosis. CD28 triggering in YT2C2 induces, therefore, an additional mechanism of cell killing, independent of granule exocytosis, the nature of which remains to be identified.","['Roger, R', 'Breard, J', 'Comisso, M', 'Bohuon, C', 'Pallardy, M', 'Bertoglio, J']","['Roger R', 'Breard J', 'Comisso M', 'Bohuon C', 'Pallardy M', 'Bertoglio J']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunotoxicologie et de Cancerogenese, INSERM CJF 93-01, Faculte de Pharmacie Paris XI, Chatenay-Malabry, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/*toxicity', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Exocytosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Necrosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Thymoma/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/25 00:00,1996/02/25 00:01,['1996/02/25 00:00'],"['1996/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(96)90045-3 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0045 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Feb 25;168(1):24-32. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine type I and II interferons (mIFNs) strongly inhibited proliferation of IL-6-dependent B9 and 7TD1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF-alpha) and human transforming growth factor-beta (hTGF-beta) potently inhibited B9 and to a lesser extent 7TD1 cells, while hIL-11, human oncostatin M (hOSM), and human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) had no inhibitory effects on IL-6-dependent growth. Conversely, IL-11 and OSM but not LIF stimulated B9 and 7TD1 cell growth. However, compared with IL-6, up to 1000-fold higher IL-11 and OSM concentrations were required to induce maximal cell proliferation. Increasing concentrations of IL-6 (up to 100 ng/ml) could not overcome the antiproliferative effects of mIFNs, hTNF-alpha and hTGF-beta. Supernatants from mIFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse macrophages (ANA-1 cell line) were tested in B9 cell assays to identify cytokines among stimulatory and inhibitory biological activities that can inhibit IL-6-dependent proliferation.

However, diluted samples contained considerable amounts of detectable IL-6 bioactivity (nanogram levels).

The objective of the presented work is the analysis of 40 allogenic bone marrow transplantations in children made in 1989-1994. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow transplantation was made in 40 children (26 boys and 14 girls), mean age 10.5 years (range 1.5-17.5 years). Indications were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 11, acute myeloid leukaemia in 10, chronic myeloid leukaemia in 6, myelodysplastic syndrome in 2, aplastic anaemia and Fanconi's anaemia in 7, non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2 and inborn errors in 2 children. The donor was in 33 patients in HLA identical sibling and in seven instances a monozygotic twin, HLA non-identical sibling or relative or unrelated matched donor. Bone marrow engraftment was achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients, in one instance the bone marrow was rejected (2.5%) and in four patients (10%) early death occurred before the bone marrow engraftment. On Aug. 15, 1995 20 patients (50%) survived, a relapse developed in 7 (17.5%) and 13 patients died in conjunction with the transplantation (32.5%). The most frequent cause of death were infectious complications (9 children) either in conjunction with the development of graft versus host reaction (6x) or without signs of this reaction (3x). As a prophylaxis of graft versus host disease 24x Cyclosporine A with corticosteroids was used, 16x with methotrexate. A chronic graft versus host disease developed in 6 of 28 children surviving 100 days after transplantation. The greatest problem are infectious (bacterial and mycotic) complications in the phase of bone marrow aplasia before engraftment of the transplanted bone marrow or in conjunction with a graft versus host reaction which cannot be completely avoided by preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplantation is also in children an effective therapeutic method of some forms of malignant haematopoietic diseases, malignant tumours and immunodeficiency states. The correct indication, suitable donor, preventive measures against the graft versus host reaction and protection against infectious complications are essential for the success of this pretentious treatment.","['Stary, J', 'Kobylka, P', 'Kavan, P', 'Komrska, V', 'Syruckova, Z', 'Vavra, V', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Hruba, A', 'Frydl, J', 'Mracek, J']","['Stary J', 'Kobylka P', 'Kavan P', 'Komrska V', 'Syruckova Z', 'Vavra V', 'Sedlacek P', 'Hruba A', 'Frydl J', 'Mracek J', 'et al.']","['II.

The observed enhancement was shown to be in good quantitative agreement with a theoretical model of elastic equilibrium describing stabilization of 100-nm vesicles in response to phospholipid redistribution. Very rapid dynamic vesiculation and direct re-fusion of the vesicles, both dependent on the phospholipid translocation activity, were found on a time scale of seconds.

Because numerous parallels exist between tissues of neural crest origin and the immune system in the regulation of postmitotic cell survival, ICAM-1 expression was studied in MM and compared with that of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 protein (bcl-2 oncoprotein), an important regulator in prolonging lymphoid cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. Frozen sections from 33 cases were studied by immunoperoxidase techniques: 14 primary MM (five in situ), nine metastatic MM (one epidermotropic), four melanocytic nevi, and six normal skin controls. The percentages of the cells that stained and their intensities (0-4+) were graded. Both ICAM-1 (90%, 3-4+) and bcl-2 (95%, 2-4+) were strongly expressed in all nine metastases, including the epidermotropic disease extension. Bcl-2 strongly decorated the tumor cells in all 14 cases of primary MM (80%, 2-4+); in the five in situ MM, bcl-2 stained the atypical melanocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and throughout the epidermis (75%, 1-2+). In contrast, ICAM-1 was negative in the in situ MM. ICAM-1 expression became strong (85%, 2-4+) in the dermal component of early invasive disease. Both ICAM-1 and bcl-2 were expressed in melanocytic nevi, decreasing in intensity deep within the dermis as the nevus cells senesced (""matured""). Only bcl-2 was expressed in the normal melanocytes of the six skin controls. These data show that bcl-2 is constitutively expressed in normal melanocytes and melanocytic nevi and persists in the transformed cells of early and late MM. ICAM-1 is expressed only after dermal involvement occurs, both in melanocytic nevi and in invasive MM; it persists in metastatic disease. The coexpression of bcl-2 and ICAM-1 demonstrates another similarity between the immune and neural crest systems, but it does not define or necessarily imply any functional interaction between the two proteins.

The intracellular acidity has been known to greatly affect apoptosis probably by affecting the activity of the endonucleases. In this study, the implication of pH in the apoptosis was investigated through the use of human HL-60 leukemia cells. The cells were incubated in media with different pH ranging from 3.5 to 7.5 for 4 hrs and the mode of cell death was investigated. The trypan blue exclusion assay showed that close to 25% and 90% of the cells were dead when incubated in pH 6.4 and pH 5.0 media, respectively. The agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA demonstrated that significant DNA fragmentation occurred in the HL-60 cells incubated in the pH 6.2-6.4 media for 4 hr indicating cell death by apoptosis. The electron microscopy study also demonstrated that many of the cells incubated in the pH 6.4 medium were in the process of apoptosis while the cells maintained in the pH 5.0 medium were dying by necrosis. The intracellular pH (pHi) of HL-60 cells was 6.6-6.9 when the extracellular pH (pHe) was 6.2-6.4. These results demonstrated that DNase I which has a maximal endonuclease activity near pH 7.0 may be responsible for the apoptosis accompanied by DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells in the pH 6.4 medium. This observation is at variance with the previous reports that DNase II mediate the DNA fragmentation in apoptosis. The cell death at extremely low pH (pH 5.0) appeared to be due mainly to necrosis.","['Park, H J']",['Park HJ'],"['Department of Microbiology, Inha University College of Medicine, Inchon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3349/ymj.1995.36.6.473 [doi]'],ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 1995 Dec;36(6):473-9. doi: 10.3349/ymj.1995.36.6.473.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that during infection, the HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP0 dispersed proteins associated with ND10, nuclear sites that contain high concentrations of PML and other potentially regulatory proteins and correspond to the ultrastructurally defined nuclear bodies. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques, we found that ICP0 mutants of HSV-1 replicate in the close proximity with ND10, but increasing replication sites develop away from these nuclear structures. Input wild-type HSV-1 DNA was found preferentially adjacent to ND10 before ICP0 modified these nuclear structures and did not colocalize with ICP8 containing so-called prereplication sites. The sites where HSV-1 can begin replication then need to be redefined as preexisting potential replication sites. Viral RNA was also found associated with ND10 before early protein synthesis (ICP8), suggesting that input virus genomes are deposited at ND10 before they start replication. The deposition of input viral DNA at ND10 is virus gene expression independent, probably indicating cell regulation of this process. Taken together, these data demonstrate that some very early processes of the nuclear viral replication cycle happen in close proximity or at the periphery of ND10. The localization of input HSV-1 to ND10 represents a new host-virus interaction and provides an unexpected functional property for this large nuclear site.","['Maul, G G', 'Ishov, A M', 'Everett, R D']","['Maul GG', 'Ishov AM', 'Everett RD']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*virology', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Virus Replication']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90094-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0094 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Mar 1;217(1):67-75. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0094.,,,,['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We asked whether synthesis of BLV capsid (CA) protein and production of infectious virus would increase when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infected sheep were stimulated in short-term culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a polyclonal activator of B-cells, and compared its effects with those of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a lymphocyte activator known to increase BLV expression. LPS treatment of PBMCs from asymptomatic sheep that had been infected for 1-4 years increased the number of cells synthesizing CA protein, the amount of CA protein per cell, and the number of PBMCs acting as infectious centers. LPS derived from several different microbes was effective. During the ensuing 4 years of asymptomatic infection, the number of PBMCs expressing virus under minimal stimulation increased for each animal. The ability of LPS to recruit additional cells to express CA protein remained constant or decreased in magnitude, yet at the same time, lower concentrations of LPS were required to elicit a maximal effect. This suggests that the cellular pathways affected by LPS are endogenously more activated as infection progresses. PHA initially stimulated fewer cells to synthesize BLV CA protein than LPS did although the amount of CA protein synthesized per cell was greater with PHA. As infection progressed, PHA surpassed LPS in the numbers of PBMCs induced to express CA protein. This suggests that the cellular pathways affected by PHA become more responsive to its effects as infection progresses. LPS increased CA expression early and transiently during culture whereas the PHA-mediated increase continued to develop for several days. Thus, LPS increases BLV expression but does so differently than PHA. Moreover, these longitudinal results show that the activation state of BLV-infected cells changes as asymptomatic infection progresses.","['Kidd, L C', 'Radke, K']","['Kidd LC', 'Radke K']","['Department of Avian Sciences and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Graduate Group, University of California, Davis 95616-8532, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/biosynthesis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/*virology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/immunology/*virology', '*Virus Replication']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90104-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0104 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Mar 1;217(1):167-77. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0104.,,,,"['CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Haemopoietic recovery was most rapid for group 1 where, in comparison with the BM group transplanted for similar disease (group 2), highly significant reductions were observed for median days to 1) neutrophil s >/= 0.5 x 10(9)L (12 v 22; p 0.0001); 2) neutrophils >/= 1.0 x 10(9)/L (14 v 27 ; p = 0.0001); platelets >/= 20 x 10(9) /L (11 v 20; p = 0.0005); and 4) platelets >/= 50 x 10(9)/L (15 v 27; p = 0.001). Similar significant reductions for the BC group over group 2 were also observed for median, (1) inpatient days (22 v 30; p = 0.0001); (2) red cell transfusions (2 v 5; p = 0.01) ; (3) platelet transfusions (2 v 6; p = 0.0001); (4) days of fever (2 v 8; p = 0.001); and (5) days on IV antibiotics (8 v 14; p = 0.02). Group 3 patients yielded data either similar to or less advantageous to that in group 2 and group 4 patients yielded data intermediate between groups 1 and 2. Data from BC harvests suggested that yields of CD34+ cells of > 2.0 x 10(6)/kg and/or of colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) of > 6.0 x 10(4)/kg were predictive of rapid haemopoietic recovery. CONCLUSION: For haemopoietic rescue following single HDT for solid tumours BC has considerable advantages over BM.","['Hill, G R', 'Inder, A', 'Patton, W N', 'Hart, D N']","['Hill GR', 'Inder A', 'Patton WN', 'Hart DN']","['Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods']",1996/02/23 00:00,1996/02/23 00:01,['1996/02/23 00:00'],"['1996/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Z Med J. 1996 Feb 23;109(1016):45-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the effects of stimulating fibroblast cultures derived from human synovium and from normal lung with OM alone or in combination with IL-1, IL-1 alpha (or IL-1 beta) at 1 or 5 ng/ml, stimulated production of high levels of granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), IL-8, and IL-6 protein. At various concentrations (0.1-50 ng/ml), OM alone failed to significantly enhance protein or mRNA levels of GM-CSF, IL-8, IL-6, or G-CSF after 18 h of stimulation. When combined with IL-1 alpha or -beta, OM caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the IL-1-induced level of IL-8 and GM-CSF protein and mRNA expression, whereas IL-6 production was simultaneously enhanced. In contrast, when IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor (two other cytokines that share gp130 receptor components with OM) were used in a similar fashion in combination with IL-1 alpha, neither cytokine consistently altered the IL-1-induced levels of IL-8, GM-CSF, or IL-6. In addition, only OM and not IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor was able to induce STAT-1 nuclear factor binding to DNA in stimulated fibroblast extracts as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results suggest that OM can significantly alter cytokine profiles of stimulated fibroblasts and may play a unique role in modulating cytokine production by these cells at sites of inflammation.","['Richards, C D', 'Langdon, C', 'Botelho, F', 'Brown, T J', 'Agro, A']","['Richards CD', 'Langdon C', 'Botelho F', 'Brown TJ', 'Agro A']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Lung/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Synovial Membrane/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 1;156(1):343-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of ceramide in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, the effects of a cell-permeable analogue, N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), on Ag-mediated cellular responses were examined. C2-Ceramide inhibited Ag- or PMA-induced activation of phospholipase D (PLD), whereas Ca2+ ionophore A23187-induced PLD activation was not affected. C2-Ceramide failed to inhibit PLD activity in two different in vitro assay systems. Since PLD activity is known to be regulated by several factors, the effects of C2-ceramide on these factors were examined. We have previously reported the possible involvement of protein tyrosine kinase in Ag-mediated PLD activation. However, C2-ceramide had no effect on Ag-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. In fura-2-loaded RBL-2H3 cells, C2-ceramide suppressed Ag-induced Ca2+ influx, leaving initial Ca2+ increase and inositol phosphate production unaffected. Western blot analysis revealed that Ag caused translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha, beta 1, beta 2, delta and epsilon isozymes from cytosol to membrane fraction. Translocation of alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 isozymes was specifically prevented by C2-ceramide. Moreover, C2-ceramide suppressed Ag-induced serotonin release. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, Ag-induced PLD activation and release reaction were greatly reduced. The inhibitory profile was nearly the same as that obtained in C2-ceramide-treated cells. These results suggest that C2-ceramide inhibits Ag-induced PLD activation and serotonin release, probably through the blockage of Ca2+ influx and translocation of Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isozymes in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Nakamura, Y', 'Nakashima, S', 'Ojio, K', 'Banno, Y', 'Miyata, H', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nakamura Y', 'Nakashima S', 'Ojio K', 'Banno Y', 'Miyata H', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/immunology', 'Extracellular Space/enzymology', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 1;156(1):256-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe an in vitro model with which it is possible to examine alloreactivity against a single HLA class I allotype. The HLA class I- and class II-negative myelocytic leukemia cell line K562 was transfected with a genomic DNA clone carrying B*4403 to express a single allotype. CTL lines were generated from normal individuals carrying B*4402, B*4403, or unrelated HLA-B alleles by stimulation with B*4403- transfected K562. The bulk CTL lines generated from B*4402+ T cells against B*4403 that carry a single amino acid disparity at position 156 were specific for B*4403+ targets and did not react with targets carrying any other HLA allotype. However, the CTL lines generated from B44-negative individuals exhibited killing of the targets bearing not only B44, but also B44 CREG and a few other B alleles. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of TCRs, expressed in the CTL clones uniquely specific for B*4403, showed that TCR V beta usage of alloreactive T cells directed against B*4403 was diverse but nonrandom and was affected by the HLA background of the responder. Thus, the K562-HLA transfectant system provides a useful in vitro tool to analyze alloreactivity against a single class I allele and to aid in the prediction of alloreactivity in unrelated marrow transplantation.","['Cereb, N', 'Yang, S Y']","['Cereb N', 'Yang SY']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*immunology', 'Genetic Variation/*immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Multigene Family/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 1;156(1):18-26.,,,,"['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL47141/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At UCSF, 15 children with immunodeficiency disorders and 58 children with leukemia received chemoradiotherapy between July 1982 and November 1993 and were evaluated for toxicity. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID) received 7 Gy TBI while leukemia patients received 12 Gy TBI. RESULTS: Eight immunodeficient patients (53%) are alive at 4 months to 11 years posttransplant. Acute toxicity was limited and treatment well tolerated. Most patients developed mild nausea and vomiting, skin rash, or erythema. Transient fever/chills, oral mucositis, and alopecia were noted in approximately 50% of patients. Seventy-three percent of all patients demonstrated acute liver dysfunction, but only four (27%) developed veno-occlusive disease. All children had decreased growth velocity but normal growth hormone levels. Other endocrinologic evaluations including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and thyroid hormones were normal. Only one evaluable girl had delayed puberty with late onset of secondary sexual characteristics. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated an intelligence quotient (IQ) reduction between the baseline and 1 year post-BMT, with some recovery at 3 years. Only one patient developed a clinically significant cataract. Thirteen percent of patients had chronic interstitial lung disease. Four children developed exostosis. Only 1 of the 15 children developed a second malignancy (acute myelogenous leukemia) at age 5, 51 months posttransplant for SCID. For patients with leukemia, similar toxicities were observed. Twenty-nine percent disease-free survival was noted with a mean follow-up of 4.7 years. Twenty-two percent had chronic interstitial lung disease and two patients were diagnosed with cataracts. Graft-vs.-host-disease (GVHD), pubertal development arrest, and delayed puberty were seen. One child developed papillary thyroid carcinoma, 49 months post-BMT. Similar neuropsychological testing decrements were also observed. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that intensive chemoradiotherapy, even at a young age, does not cause severe, acute, or late toxicities but does result in a small IQ decrement and the risk of secondary malignancy in children with long-term follow-up.","['Chou, R H', 'Wong, G B', 'Kramer, J H', 'Wara, D W', 'Matthay, K K', 'Crittenden, M R', 'Swift, P S', 'Cowan, M J', 'Wara, W M']","['Chou RH', 'Wong GB', 'Kramer JH', 'Wara DW', 'Matthay KK', 'Crittenden MR', 'Swift PS', 'Cowan MJ', 'Wara WM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francsico, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chediak-Higashi Syndrome/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Endocrine System Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Male', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/therapy']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360301695021787 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)02178-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Mar 1;34(4):843-51. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)02178-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-tumor potential of a panel of 13 cytokines against murine PmT-transformed endothelial cells. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) substantially decreased in a dose-dependent manner the proliferation of a panel of 6 PmT-transformed cell lines. IFNalpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNFalpha) had marginal anti-proliferative activity, whereas other molecules (interleukins-1, -2, -4, -6 and -13, IFNbeta, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) caused no growth inhibition. IFNgamma and TGFbeta1 were therefore selected for further analysis of their mechanism of action and in vivo relevance. IFNgamma and TGFbeta1 reduced the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate, without modifying the tyrosine kinase(s) activity associated with PmT. IFNgamma and TGFbeta1 were also tested for their ability to modify the in vivo growth of the PmT-transformed endothelial cells H5V in syngeneic C57B1/6 mice. Treatment with IFNnu and TGFbeta1 significantly delayed tumor growth and increased survival time. In contrast, treatment with IFNalpha and TNFalpha failed to prolong survival. In nude mice, IFNgamma and TGFbeta1 had a transient effect on tumor growth but no effect on survival, suggesting a contribution of T cells to the in vivo anti-tumor activity of these cytokines.","['Dong, Q G', 'Graziani, A', 'Garlanda, C', 'De Calmanovici, R W', 'Arese, M', 'Soldi, R', 'Vecchi, A', 'Mantovani, A', 'Bussolino, F']","['Dong QG', 'Graziani A', 'Garlanda C', 'De Calmanovici RW', 'Arese M', 'Soldi R', 'Vecchi A', 'Mantovani A', 'Bussolino F']","['Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytokines/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemangioendothelioma', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<700::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<700::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Mar 1;65(5):700-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<700::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because alkyl-lysophospholipids target the cell membrane as their site of action, our aim was to analyse the immunological effects of a nonlethal ALP treatment on leukemic K562 cells. In this in vitro study we used ET-18-OCH3, one of the most potent ALP derivatives, at different concentrations ranging from 25 up to 100 microgram/ml. By measurement of cell viability and of apoptosis, we determined a concentration of 25 microgram/ml ET-18-OCH3 and an incubation period of 2 hr as nonlethal for K562 cells; higher concentrations markedly reduced cell viability and led to induction of apoptosis. Similar to the effects induced by nonlethal heat shock, a nontoxic ET-18-OCH3 treatment led to a significant increase in the sensitivity of K562 cells to lysis by interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated natural killer (NK) cells. With respect to these results, we investigated the influence of nonlethal ALP treatment on the cell surface expression patterns and compared it to the results obtained with nonlethal heat shock. ALP treatment does not induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression; however, a significant increase in the cell surface expression of HSP72 was shown by immunoblot analysis of membrane lysates of either untreated or ET-18-OCH3 treated K562 cells. The increased sensitivity of ET-18-OCH3 treated K562 cells to lysis by NK cells could be correlated with the elevated cell surface expression of HSP72.","['Botzler, C', 'Kolb, H J', 'Issels, R D', 'Multhoff, G']","['Botzler C', 'Kolb HJ', 'Issels RD', 'Multhoff G']","['GSF-Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit GmbH, Institut fur Klinische Hamatologie, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<633::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<633::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Mar 1;65(5):633-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<633::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-8.,,,,,,['Int J Cancer 1996 May 29;66(5):713'],,,,,,,,,,,

A series of human leukemic CCRF-CEM sublines, isolated by multi-step selection for very high resistance to MTX, exhibit multiple mechanisms of MTX resistance, including decreased carrier-mediated uptake of MTX and DHFR gene amplification. These sublines show cross-resistance to drugs of the multi-drug resistance (MDR) family, which is correlated with relative resistance to MTX. The MTX-selected sublines show increased expression and function of the MDR1 gene, based on the measurement of MDR1 mRNA, Pgp and rhodamine 123 accumulation. Sequence analysis of the MDR1 cDNA from MTX-selected CCRF-CEM cells revealed no mutations in the protein coding region. MTX resistance in these cell lines is partially reversible by a Pgp-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) UIC2 and a monovalent FaB fragment of UIC2. Our results indicate that Pgp can contribute to multifactorial resistance to MTX.","['Norris, M D', 'De Graaf, D', 'Haber, M', 'Kavallaris, M', 'Madafiglio, J', 'Gilbert, J', 'Kwan, E', 'Stewart, B W', 'Mechetner, E B', 'Gudkov, A V', 'Roninson, I B']","['Norris MD', 'De Graaf D', 'Haber M', 'Kavallaris M', 'Madafiglio J', 'Gilbert J', 'Kwan E', 'Stewart BW', 'Mechetner EB', 'Gudkov AV', 'Roninson IB']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/toxicity', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division', 'Chick Embryo', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<613::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<613::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Mar 1;65(5):613-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<613::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-8.,,,,['R37 CA40333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to address this issue we determined, in a case-control study, the prevalence of antibodies to viruses infecting blood or bone-marrow cells [Epstein-Barr virsus (EBV), human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), parvovirus B19] as well as to the human virus known for its tumour-suppressive properties, the adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2), in the sera of 121 children with leukaemia in Germany, and in 197 control individuals, hospitalized for other reasons, and matched for age and gender to the cases. In addition, we developed a questionnaire to be answered by the children's parents, in order to gain information on previous infections of the children as well as to calculate for factors which may influence serological findings. Comparative determination of the prevalence of antibodies against AAV-2, B-19 or HHV-6 revealed no significant differences in cases and controls. However, antibodies to EBV were more frequently found in children with leukaemia younger than 6 years of age (age at the time of diagnosis of leukaemia) than in controls. Apparently, infection with AAV-2 has no protective effect in childhood leukaemia, in contrast to results observed for other malignancies. Similarly, and in accordance with results on leukaemia in adults, we found no indication of a protective effect of infection with the parvovirus B-19. The data suggest that EBV, which is known to be involved in various lymphomas, may play a role in the development of childhood leukaemia in young children.","['Schlehofer, B', 'Blettner, M', 'Geletneky, K', 'Haaf, H G', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Michaelis, J', 'Mueller-Lantzsch, N', 'Niehoff, D', 'Winkelspecht, B', 'Wahrendorf, J', 'Schlehofer, J R']","['Schlehofer B', 'Blettner M', 'Geletneky K', 'Haaf HG', 'Kaatsch P', 'Michaelis J', 'Mueller-Lantzsch N', 'Niehoff D', 'Winkelspecht B', 'Wahrendorf J', 'Schlehofer JR']","['Division of Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dependovirus', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*complications', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*complications', 'Parvovirus B19, Human', 'Paternal Age', 'Risk', 'Virus Diseases/complications']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<584::AID-IJC5>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<584::AID-IJC5>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Mar 1;65(5):584-90. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<584::AID-IJC5>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 68% of residents of Kin-Hu township in Kinmen over 30 years of age participated in this study. Eight of 1,425 males and 14 of 1,595 females had HTLV-I infection. Antibody reactivities were further tested by Western blot assays with HTLV-I or HTLV-II type-specific recombinant envelope glycoproteins, and it was determined that all of those infected had HTLV-I and none had HTLV-II. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. The final model indicated that the significant factors associated with HTLV-I infection in Kinmen were age and coastal residency. Age was positively correlated with HTLV-I infection. The eastern coastal area had a rate of HTLV-I infection 3.1 times higher than other areas in Kin-Hu.

Expression of CD18 was closely correlated to that of CD11a or CD11b when comparing the fluorescence intensity observed in different experiments.

This binding was increased when platelets were activated by thrombin and was decreased by an anti CD11a, CD18 and anti CD54 mAb.

CD34 is usually analyzed by flow cytometry (FC), but may also be analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IH). The present study was undertaken to compare these 2 methods. Bone marrow from 16 patients with MDS and 12 with AML and from 12 healthy young volunteers was studied. The expression of CD34 was analyzed with FC on fresh bone marrow cells and with IH on sections of paraffin-embedded bone marrow. The correlation between FC and IH was good both for patients with MDS (p<0.0001) and AML (p<0.01). However, in patients with a high number of CD34-positive cells, the FC method seemed to result in a higher percentage of positive cells compared to the IH method. In normal bone marrow, the ratio between the percentage of CD34-positive cells and the percentage of bone marrow blasts was approximately 0.8. In the whole group of MDS patients, this ratio was 1:1, while in patients with refractory anemia (RA) and ring sideroblastic anemia (RAS) it was 1.6. Patients with MDS differed significantly from patients with de novo AML, who showed a ratio of only 0.23 (p<0.01). We conclude that the FC and IH methods for measuring expression of CD34 are well-correlated in MDS and reasonably well correlated in AML. A stem cell phenotype is more commonly expressed on precursor cells from patients with MDS than from patients with AML.","['Kanter-Lewensohn, L', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Kock, Y', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg, A', 'Ost, A']","['Kanter-Lewensohn L', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Kock Y', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg A', 'Ost A']","['Department of Pathology, Karolinska Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Biotin', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Prognosis', 'Streptavidin']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01330.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Mar;56(3):124-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01330.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2 other children had clinical signs of auto-GVHD (grade I and grade II); they both are in complete remission but after a first normal haematological recovery they had a prolonged period of aplasia until month 9 for 1 patient and still persistent at month 7 in the other case. We studied lymphocyte subsets reconstitution after transplantation in these patients. All patients had an important decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio related both to a strong decrease in the CD4+ cells and a strong increase in the CD8+ cells. Most of the CD8+ cells were of the CD8bright+ CD28- phenotype. These CD8bright+ CD28- T-cells represented from 33% to 68% of the total lymphocytes. We discuss the role of these cells after autologous transplantation with CsA, and wonder if these cells could mediate cytotoxicity. In conclusion, among 4 children who received autologous BM or PBC transplantation with low dose of CsA, we observed a complete remission after an auto-GVHD and a prolonged period of aplasia in 2 patients and a relapse of leukaemia in 2 other patients.

The C-terminal heparin-binding domain of FN (Hep II) has recently been demonstrated to support adhesion of alpha 4 beta 1-dependent melanoma cells [A. P. Mould and M. J. Humphries (1991) EMBO J. 10, 4089-4095]. Previously we demonstrated that this region of FN mediated binding of FN to HL-60 cells (acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line) by direct interaction independently of RGD and CS1 [H. Fujita et al., (1995) Exp. Cell Res. 217, 484-488]. In this study we have characterized a novel site in the Hep II region for binding to HL-60 cells. alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 were expressed on HL-60 cells, while alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 were not present, as shown by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies specific for the different integrins. Anti-alpha 4 beta 1 (P4C2) and anti-beta 1 (JB1a) antibodies inhibited binding of a 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment of FN to HL-60 cells. This fragment contains the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of FN but lacks CS1 and CS5. Only the peptide representing the sequence from Val1866 to Arg1880, designated E1, inhibited the binding of the 29-kDa fragment to HL-60 cells. The active region of this peptide was a sequence of Thr-Asp-Ile-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ser (TAI-DAPS), which is homologous to Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ser (LDVPS) derived from the active site of CS1. Furthermore, labeled E1 peptide directly bound to HL-60 cells. The anti-alpha 4 beta 1 antibody (P4C2) inhibited this interaction. These results indicate that the site of binding to hematopoietic cells is present in the Hep II region of FN and the definition of the chemical structure of FN clarifies a fundamental mechanism of cell invasion of the extracellular matrix.","['Mohri, H', 'Katoh, K', 'Iwamatsu, A', 'Okubo, T']","['Mohri H', 'Katoh K', 'Iwamatsu A', 'Okubo T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Heparin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90042-7 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0042 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Feb 1;222(2):326-32. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro growth of FA fibroblasts is impaired, due to a defective G2 phase traverse of the cell cycle. Analyzing the cell cycle of lymphoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained from peripheral blood of FA patients by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus, we found a similar G2 phase defect, which was dependent upon the oxygen concentration. In addition, FA cells exhibited hypersensitivity toward cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum and mitomycin C, and moderate sensitivity toward trans-dichlorodiammineplatinum. FA cells, however, showed no elevated sensitivity toward paraquat, an intracellular generator of superoxide radicals, or cumene hydroperoxide, a model organic peroxide. Chelating iron with low concentrations of o-phenanthrolin improved cell proliferation and G2 phase transit of FA cells at 20% oxygen, but little at 5% oxygen. LCL cultures from healthy subjects were inhibited in their proliferation rate at all concentrations of o-phenanthrolin. Exposure to excess iron, on the other hand, was very toxic to FA cells at 20%, but less toxic at 5% oxygen. In conclusion, the FA mutation leads to a cell cycle defect, which is expressed in cultures of lymphoid cells from FA patients, and involves hypersensitivity toward bifunctional alkylating agents, oxygen, and iron.","['Poot, M', 'Gross, O', 'Epe, B', 'Pflaum, M', 'Hoehn, H']","['Poot M', 'Gross O', 'Epe B', 'Pflaum M', 'Hoehn H']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Ethidium', 'Fanconi Anemia/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'G1 Phase/immunology', 'G2 Phase/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metaphase/immunology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/pharmacology', 'S Phase/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90033-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0033 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Feb 1;222(2):262-8. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathways leading to 6-methylmercapto-8-hydroxypurine in vivo are not yet fully understood. In a group of 17 patients treated with four courses of high-dose 6-mercaptopurine infusions according to the ALL-8 treatment protocol of the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group, the steady-state concentrations of 6-methylmercapto-8-hydroxypurine in plasma were one-fifth of the parent drug concentrations, with wide interindividual variation. The formation of high concentrations of 6-methylmercapto-8-hydroxypurine in plasma, especially during the infusion, probably indicates another catabolic pathway of high-dose 6-mercaptopurine, apart from its conversion into thiouric acid.","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen, C W', 'van Baal, J M', 'De Abreu, R A', 'de Jong, J G', 'Zuiderent, R', 'Trijbels, J M']","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen CW', 'van Baal JM', 'De Abreu RA', 'de Jong JG', 'Zuiderent R', 'Trijbels JM']","['Center for Pediatric Oncology SE Netherlands, St. Radboud University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (6-methylmercapto-8-hydroxypurine)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 1996 Mar;42(3):380-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera from arthritic rats (14 d post-adjuvant treatment) in the presence of Zn (50 mumol/L)+dexamethasone (Dex; 1 mumol/L) increased metallothionein (MT) accumulation by 34% above that obtained with control rat serum with Zn+Dex. Endogenous IL-6 activity in serum from arthritic rats was 93 +/- 49 U/mL and was undetectable in control rat serum. The activities of TNF, IL-1 and corticosterone concentrations were the same in control and arthritic rats. The accumulation of MT in hepatocytes in the presence of Zn (10 mumol/L)+Dex (1 mumol/L) was enhanced 29% and 49% by media from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophage (PMM) and Kupffer cell cultures (KCM), respectively. The response with PMM and KCM was quantitatively the same as that with interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analysis of PMM and KCM showed activities of 1,000-10,000 U/mL for IL-6, 100-1000 U/mL for TNF and < 10,000 U/mL for IL-1, the latter detected only in PMM. LPS alone enhanced the accumulation of MT above Zn+Dex in a dose dependent manner. A significant LPS response was obtained at 5 mg/L with a maximal stimulation above Zn+Dex of 38% at 10 mg/L. This direct stimulation of MT by LPS was not part of the response observed with PMM and KCM where the final LPS concentration in culture was only 0.1 mg/L. Other cytokines capable of synergy with Zn+Dex on MT synthesis were investigated. Interleukin-11 (IL-11) increased the Zn+Dex induction in a dose dependent manner with maximal stimulation at 100 U/mL of 40%. A small stimulation of 12% above Zn+Dex was obtained with leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) at concentrations greater than 100 U/mL. No enhancement of the Zn+Dex response was obtained with interleukin-3 (1000 U/mL), interleukin-4 (10 micrograms/L), platelet activating factor (5 nmol/L) or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (5 micrograms/L). Neither IL-11 nor LIF enhanced the response obtained with Zn+Dex+IL-6. The results demonstrate that mediators present in arthritic rat serum and in LPS-stimulated PMM and KCM cause a quantitatively similar response on MT accumulation as IL-6. IL-11 and to a lesser extent LIF, are also potential mediators of MT synthesis in inflammation.","['Coyle, P', 'Philcox, J C', 'Rofe, A M']","['Coyle P', 'Philcox JC', 'Rofe AM']","['Division of Clinical Biochemistry, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

We have examined the mechanism of superantigen-induced activation of the TNF gene promoter in primary human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and in the leukemic T cell line Jurkat. Like stimulation of the T cell receptor complex through CD3 ligation, SEB induces binding of nuclear proteins to Egr- and Jun/ATF-related consensus sequences present between nucleotides -170 and -100 of the TNF promoter 5' flanking region. By cotransfection of Jurkat T cells with constructs containing TNF promoter deletion mutants linked to a CAT reporter gene, it is shown that superantigens can activate transcription from these two adjacent ETs and Jun/ATF binding elements. Superantigen-induced binding of Egr-1 and Jun/ATF is markedly reduced by okadaic acid, suggesting that phosphatases are involved in the signaling of SE. When compared to CD3 ligation, superantigens activate the TNF promoter more potently, which is likely due to costimulatory signals provided by superantigen presenting cells.","['Kramer, B', 'Machleidt, T', 'Wiegmann, K', 'Kronke, M']","['Kramer B', 'Machleidt T', 'Wiegmann K', 'Kronke M']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inflamm,Journal of inflammation,9511967,"['0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Superantigens/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Inflamm. 1995;45(3):183-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to adults, in children mediastinal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are usually synonymous with lymphoblastic lymphoma, and nonlymphoblastic lymphomas are rare. We describe nine children with primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma who were treated with the Children's Cancer Group protocol CCG-503, a randomized phase III protocol for disseminated nonlymphoblastic lymphoma. Histologic subclassification revealed three immunoblastic lymphomas, three multilobated large cell lymphomas, one with clear cell features, and two large noncleaved cell lymphomas. Sclerosis, of variable degrees, was seen in all tumors. Immunophenotyping revealed all tumors to be of B cell lineage. Thymic epithelial cells could be demonstrated, utilizing antibody to keratin, in two of nine patients, suggesting that some of the tumors are of thymic origin. None of the patients had central nervous system or bone marrow involvement. It appears that primary mediastinal nonlymphoblastic lymphomas in children, although much less common, are similar to those seen in adults. These tumors must be differentiated from lymphoblastic lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease, as the therapeutic approach may depend on histologic subtype. Primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma in children appears curable with aggressive treatment in the majority of patients.","['Piira, T', 'Perkins, S L', 'Anderson, J R', 'Meadows, A T', 'Chilcote, R R', 'Kadin, M', 'Kjeldsberg, C R']","['Piira T', 'Perkins SL', 'Anderson JR', 'Meadows AT', 'Chilcote RR', 'Kadin M', 'Kjeldsberg CR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences, Salt Lake City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Pathol Lab Med,"Pediatric pathology & laboratory medicine : journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology, affiliated with the International Paediatric Pathology Association",9518033,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Random Allocation']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/15513819509026992 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Pathol Lab Med. 1995 Jul-Aug;15(4):561-70. doi: 10.3109/15513819509026992.,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BMT preparative regimen consisted of busulfan (16 mg/kg body wt.), followed by cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Cyclosporin A and short methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. The post-transplant period was complicated by staphylococcal septicemia, CMV infection, renal insufficiency, and acute GvHD grade III. Hematological recovery was delayed (post-transplant day +55). The patient was discharged at day +68 in complete remission without any evidence of MDS. RFLP fingerprint analysis showed complete engraftment of the donor's hematopoiesis. The patient's leukemia relapsed 9 months post-transplant, and death followed due to CMV infection and multiorgan failure. Despite the fatal course in this patient, allogeneic BMT could be an option for curative treatment of the hematopoietic failure in SDS.

Although MSI has been found to be associated with a wide variety of solid cancers, its involvement in lymphoid malignancies is virtually unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the presence of MSI in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders by comparing the pattern of nine microsatellite repeats (two tetranucleotides, two trinucleotides, and five dinucleotides) on autologous germline and tumor DNA of 23 patients, including 17 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (B-CLL/SLL), four with hairy cell leukemia, one with lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and one with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All samples at diagnosis displayed a germline pattern of the microsatellites examined, thus suggesting that MSI is not involved in the pathogenesis of these lymphoproliferations. Also, no microsatellite alterations were observed in consecutive samples of B-CLL/SLL obtained from the same patient at various stages of the disease both before and after chemotherapy. Conversely, alterations in 3/9 microsatellite repeats were detected in one case of Richter's syndrome which had evolved from a pre-existent B-CLL/SLL phase. Overall, the low frequency of MSI among chronic lymphoproliferative disorders adds further weight to the common view that the mechanisms and patterns of genomic instability in lymphoid neoplasia differ markedly from those commonly observed in solid cancers.","['Volpe, G', 'Gamberi, B', 'Pastore, C', 'Roetto, A', 'Pautasso, M', 'Parvis, G', 'Camaschella, C', 'Mazza, U', 'Saglio, G', 'Gaidano, G']","['Volpe G', 'Gamberi B', 'Pastore C', 'Roetto A', 'Pautasso M', 'Parvis G', 'Camaschella C', 'Mazza U', 'Saglio G', 'Gaidano G']","['Laboratory of Medicine and Molecular Oncology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Turin, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Syndrome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00641310 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Feb;72(2):67-71. doi: 10.1007/BF00641310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of April 1995, probability of leukemia-free survival projected at 10 years after BMT was 60% for patients transplanted in first CR compared with 10% for patients transplanted beyond first CR. Transplant-related mortality was 11% after BMT in first CR and 39% after BMT beyond first CR. Probability of relapse projected at 10 years after BMT is 32% for patients who received transplants in first CR and 81% for patients who received transplants beyond first CR.

In addition, ultrastructural studies contribute to the identification of rare forms of acute myeloid leukemias (minimally differentiated, megakaryoblastic).

METHODS: E-11 cells were transfected with tax expression vector using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. IL-6 production and gene expression were investigated by ELISA and Northern blot analysis, respectively. To clarify how tax induces IL-6 gene expression, we used deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: Transfection of the tax gene induced markedly high levels of IL-6 mRNA. Furthermore, the tax gene strongly transactivated IL-6 gene promoter activity assayed by CAT assay. By using deletion and site specific mutations, we have identified a nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B sequence (positions -73 to -63) which is essential for tax transaction. EMSA demonstrated the induction of specific binding of nuclear extracts to the NF-kappa B sequence by HTLV-I tax. CONCLUSION: The HTLV-1 tax gene may transactivate IL-6 gene in the synovial cells through NF-kappa B and may contribute in the pathophysiology of HTLV-I associated arthritis.","['Mori, N', 'Shirakawa, F', 'Abe, M', 'Kamo, Y', 'Koyama, Y', 'Murakami, S', 'Shimizu, H', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Oda, S', 'Eto, S']","['Mori N', 'Shirakawa F', 'Abe M', 'Kamo Y', 'Koyama Y', 'Murakami S', 'Shimizu H', 'Yamamoto K', 'Oda S', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Genes, pX/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Synovial Membrane/pathology/*virology', 'Tissue Extracts/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Rheumatol. 1995 Nov;22(11):2049-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to clarify the physiologic role of FN in the regulation of biologic behavior of terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells, we have examined the change of VLA-5 expression during myeloid cell differentiation and its effects on monocytes and granulocytes. VLA-5 alpha mRNA was up-regulated during monocytic differentiation, but not during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Flow cytometric and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that surface expression of VLA-5 was selectively increased upon monocytic differentiation and that it was strongly positive on peripheral blood monocytes. Susceptibility to FN-induced apoptosis was greatly increased upon monocytic differentiation, and it was almost completely abrogated by anti-VLA-5 Ab or RGD peptide. Similarly, FN could significantly enhance apoptosis of normal monocytes but not of granulocytes. Finally, we have shown that anti-FN Ab could suppress spontaneous apoptosis of normal monocytes in culture and prolong their survival. These results suggest that FN might play an important role in negative regulation of the survival of monocytes through its interaction with VLA-5, which is selectively up-regulated during monocytic differentiation.","['Terui, Y', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Sakai, T', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Sugahara, H', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Kitagawa, S', 'Miura, Y']","['Terui Y', 'Furukawa Y', 'Sakai T', 'Kikuchi J', 'Sugahara H', 'Kanakura Y', 'Kitagawa S', 'Miura Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Fibronectins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/*immunology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Mar 1;156(5):1981-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the first characterization of this enzyme in a human myeloid cell line using an ELISA-based assay, which was subsequently used to measure alpha 1,4GalT activity in the human leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines. In general, there is a positive correlation between the levels of endogenous Gb3Cer and the level of the alpha 1,4 GalT activity.

The first was the hydroxyl radical adduct, 5,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxypyrrolidine-1-oxyl (DMPO-OH), which formed immediately upon PbO2 oxidation. The second had a 6-line EPR spectrum typical of a carbon-centered radical (AN = 15.9 G; AH = 22.4 G) and formed more slowly. No radical signals were detected in the absence of either cells or PbO2 treatment. The 6-line spectrum could be duplicated in model systems that contained ascorbate, DMPO and DMPO-OH, where the latter was formed from hydroxyl radicals generated by sonolysis or the cleavage of hydrogen peroxide with Fe2+ (Fenton reaction). In addition, enrichment of MC-1010 cells with ascorbate prior to spin trapping yielded the 6-line EPR spectrum as the principal adduct following PbO2 oxidation and filtration. These results suggest that ascorbate reacted with DMPO-OH to form a carbon-centered ascorbyl radical that was subsequently trapped by DMPO. The requirement for mild oxidation to detect the hydroxyl radical adduct suggests that DMPO-OH formed in the cells was reduced to an EPR-silent form (i.e., the hydroxylamine derivative). Alternatively, the hydroxylamine derivative was the species initially formed. The evidence for endogenous hydroxyl radical formation in unstimulated leukocytes may be relevant to the leukemic nature of the MC-1010 cell line. The spin trapping of the ascorbyl radical is the first report of formation of the carbon-centered ascorbyl radical by means other than pulse radiolysis. Unless it is spin trapped, the carbon-centered ascorbyl radical immediately rearranges to the more stable oxygen-centered species that is passive to spin trapping and characterized by the well-known EPR doublet of AH4 = 1.8 G.","['Bernofsky, C', 'Bandara, B M']","['Bernofsky C', 'Bandara BM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '39R4TAN1VT (ferrous sulfate)', '7170JZ1QF3 (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/*analysis', 'Carbon', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Ferrous Compounds/pharmacology', 'Free Radicals/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hydroxyl Radical/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Sonication', 'Spin Labels', '*Spin Trapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/19 00:00,1995/07/19 00:01,['1995/07/19 00:00'],"['1995/07/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00928153 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1995 Jul 19;148(2):155-64. doi: 10.1007/BF00928153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-incubation with testosterone or androstenedione significantly (p<0.05) increased the maximum number of TXA2 binding sites (Bmax) in HEL cells compared to controls. There was no significant change in Kd values. In a separate series of experiments, HEL cells were incubated with the androgen receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide (2.5mM). Treatment with androstenedione (500nM) significantly (p<0.05) increased the Bmax value by 35% compared to control and hydroxyflutamide completely antagonized this effect of androstenedione. Incubation with hydroxyflutamide alone had no effect on the Bmax values compared to control. RASM cells also showed an increase in Bmax values by 25% and 23% over control (95+/-6.6, 118+/-7.2 and 117+/-5.1 fmoles/mg protein, control, testosterone and androstenedione, n=3).

The problem of assessing the adequacy of model fit when the expectations are small is addressed by analytical calculations and by simulation. The method is illustrated with data from the national register of childhood tumours. DESIGN: The tumour data are recorded in a national register. SETTING: England, Scotland, and Wales. SUBJECTS: The cases considered are all children registered with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma under the age of 15 years between 1966-87. MAIN RESULTS: The methods show a significant variation of leukaemia incidence in relation to the Register General's standard region and a negative association with socioeconomic deprivation, as measured by the Townsend index. After allowing for these variables, the incidence seems to be reasonably homogeneous throughout the population, in the sense that the residual deviance does not seem to be much larger than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: The methods described have major advantages over standardisation in controlling for confounding, both in terms of flexibility of factor selection and assessment and also in the ability to determine whether there is residual variability of incidence after allowing for these factors.","['Bithell, J F', 'Dutton, S J', 'Neary, N M', 'Vincent, T J']","['Bithell JF', 'Dutton SJ', 'Neary NM', 'Vincent TJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Models, Statistical', 'Regression Analysis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.49.suppl_2.s15 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1995 Dec;49 Suppl 2:S15-9. doi: 10.1136/jech.49.suppl_2.s15.,['J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996 Dec;50(6):689-90.

The solid tumour has various properties which tend to minimize the effects of a cytotoxic agent; the low vascular density of tumours, in particular, limits the diffusion of many anti-tumour drugs. 2. This applies particularly to two general classes of anti-cancer drugs which already play an important role in chemotherapy: mitotic poisons and topoisomerase poisons. Such compounds bind strongly to proteins and/or DNA, and their diffusion from the bloodstream into solid tumours is slow, as is their clearance from tumour tissue. 3. The specific questions posed here is whether anti-cancer compounds of these types are more cytotoxic when administered at a low concentration for a long time (mimicking conditions in solid tumours) than at a correspondingly high concentration for a short time (mimicking conditions in host tissue). Two possible principles may be involved, the first based on cytokinetic considerations and then second on self-inhibition of drug cytotoxicity. 4. Using cultured human cancer cells we have shown that taxol, which acts on mitotic cells and camptothecin, which acts on S-phase cells, are examples of the first principle. Exposures to high drug concentrations for short times are much less cytotoxic than exposure to correspondingly lower drug concentrations for a longer time (with the same concentration x time of exposure). We also show that the drug DACA (N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide) developed in this laboratory and currently undergoing clinical trial, achieves the same result through the principle of self-inhibition of cytotoxicity. 5. Matching of the cytokinetic or self-inhibitory profile of a drugs' action with the pharmacokinetics of drug in tumours may provide new drugs with increased anti-tumour effects.","['Baguley, B C', 'Finlay, G J']","['Baguley BC', 'Finlay GJ']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', ""89459-25-6 (N-(2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide)"", 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Camptothecin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01943.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 1995 Nov;22(11):825-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01943.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recognition specificity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be genetically modified by stable introduction of chimeric T cell receptor genes and thus be directed towards tumor cells. We designed a recombinant T cell receptor (TCR) component consisting of a single chain Fv derivative of a monoclonal antibody (scFv) serving as the extracellular antigen-binding domain and the zeta-chain of the TCR/CD3 complex serving as a signal transducing domain. Three chimeric receptor constructs differing in their molecular structure were derived and their functions in transduced T cells compared. A construct in which the scFv domain, specific for the ErbB-2 receptor, was fused directly to the zeta-chain, and two constructs containing different hinge regions between the functional domains, were made. The hinge regions serve as spacers which increase the distance of the scFv moiety from the plasma membrane. Only the two scFv-zeta chimeras containing a hinge region showed ErbB-2 binding activity, when expressed in T cells. The scFv-zeta construct which lacks a spacer segment did not. Consistently, only the spacer-containing chimeras transduced T cell receptor signals following ErbB-2 mediated crosslinking. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and cytokine secretion was observed. ErbB-2 expressing tumor cells were efficiently lysed by CTLs which expressed the spacer-containing scFv-zeta chimeras.

Another method involves the grafting of fibroblasts genetically engineered to produce a foreign gene product of interest. It is not clear to what extent retrovirus production in vivo provides an advantage over the grafting of genetically engineered cells for the purpose of achieving transgene expression. These two methods of gene delivery were compared in vivo by using the following cell lines: CRIP-MFG-LacZ cells, which express the lacZ gene and produce retrovirus vectors that bear this gene, and CRIP-LacZ cells, which express the lacZ gene, but do not produce retrovirus. Gene delivery was assessed in C6 gliomas established in the righ frontal lobe of athymic mice. CRIP-MFG-LacZ or CRIP-LacZ cells were inoculated stereotactically into these tumors. When CRIP-MFG-LacZ cells were used, a relatively elevated level of lacZ gene expression was present in cells scattered throughout the tumor. Using a computerized imaging system, this expression occurred in approximately 10% of the tumor area at 1 week, 42% at 2 weeks, and 32% at 3 weeks. In contrast, with CRIP-LacZ cells, lacZ gene expression was much weaker and occurred in a more focal area within the tumor. This expression occupied approximately 5% of the tumor area at 1 and 2 weeks and had almost disappeared at 3 weeks. In both cases there was no notable expression of the transgene in normal brain cells. In conclusion, transgene expression in brain tumors was achieved in more cells, at higher levels, and for longer time periods with retroviral vector-producing cells than with genetically engineered fibroblasts. This efficiency of gene delivery likely results from direct in situ delivery of the transgene to tumor cells with subsequent inheritance of the reporter gene to progeny tumor cells.","['Tamiya, T', 'Wei, M X', 'Chase, M', 'Ono, Y', 'Lee, F', 'Breakefield, X O', 'Chiocca, E A']","['Tamiya T', 'Wei MX', 'Chase M', 'Ono Y', 'Lee F', 'Breakefield XO', 'Chiocca EA']","['Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Frontal Lobe', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1995 Oct;2(8):531-8.,,,,['NS 24279-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the concentration of CH used (1 microgram/ml) the cytotoxicity of DOX was reduced in cultured P388 leukemia cells. An analysis of the DNA histogram obtained by flow cytometry showed that DOX exerts its growth-inhibitory effect by blocking the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in P388 cells. Treatment with CH diminished this blocking effect. When CH was added to the growth medium before DOX exposure, no change in intracellular DOX accumulation was observed. Treatment with CH (15 mg/kg) significantly diminished the lethality of DOX (20 mg/kg) in mice and it also reduced the antitumor activity of mice with P388 leukemia. Thus, CH inhibited cell death induced by DOX in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that CH has an antagonistic effect on the pharmacological actions of DOX in cells and mice. The cytoprotective effect of CH may be due to protein synthesis inhibition.","['Furusawa, S', 'Nakano, S', 'Kosaka, K', 'Takayanagi, M', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Furusawa S', 'Nakano S', 'Kosaka K', 'Takayanagi M', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/toxicity', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.18.1367 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1995 Oct;18(10):1367-72. doi: 10.1248/bpb.18.1367.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One step in this pathway is mediated by a family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, the Janus kinases or JAK kinases, which become phosphorylated upon ligand-receptor binding and receptor phosphorylation. This in turn is followed by phosphorylation of certain members of a family of latent transcription factors, called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which subsequently enter the nucleus, bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion, and modulate transcription. In view of the apparent role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in bone remodeling, we sought to determine which, if any, of the JAK/STAT family members are involved in mediating the actions of LIF using the MC3T3-E1 cell line (a spontaneously immortalized osteoblast) and normal murine calvarial osteoblasts. We report here rapid and transient phosphorylation of the LIF receptor, and similarly, we detect phosphorylation of predominantly JAK1 and to a minor extent JAK2 in response to LIF treatment in MC3T3-E1 cells. In these experiments we also detect phosphorylation of STAT1 and to a much lesser degree STAT3 upon addition of LIF. Phosphorylation of the STAT1 proteins correlates directly with their ability to bind DNA in a gel mobility shift assay in MC3T3-E1 and in normal calvarial osteoblasts. These studies suggest that LIF action in these cells, as in other cell types, is mediated in part via specific members of the JAK/STAT pathway.","['Lowe, C', 'Gillespie, G A', 'Pike, J W']","['Lowe C', 'Gillespie GA', 'Pike JW']","['Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650101106 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1995 Nov;10(11):1644-50. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650101106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, research is being carried out to develop protective vaccines against BLV that have gp51 as their main component. Taking both of these factors into account, it is clear that there will be an increasing requirement for the virus antigen gp51 for some time to come. The permanently BLV-infected foetal lamb kidney cell line FLK/BLV (and its sublines) has been proved to be the most useful culture for the mass production of the virus antigen. Stable cell lines producing higher quantities of BLV antigen have not been established, either by subcloning of the FLK/BLV or by infection of other permanent cells with BLV. Here, a report is made on efforts to increase the expression of gp51 in BLV-infected cells via the additional expression of homologous transactivating virus protein tax.

The method of silver staining was used to determine the number of AgNORs per nucleus of cells. The activity of 5'nucleotidase, acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase was assessed. The AgNOR proteins quantity varied with immunophenotype and cytochemical profile of leukemic cells. The enzyme 5'nucleotidase is known to be the marker enzyme in beta-precursors ALL and acid phosphatase in T-ALL blast cells. Activity of beta-glucuronidase emerged in lymphoblasts of some cases of ALL in close relation to increased number of AgNOR proteins per nucleus of leukemic cells. Our study indicates the possible importance of beta-glucuronidase involvement and increase AgNOR quantity in the proliferative activity of leukemic cells and thus they are of value in monitoring the risk groups of leukemic patients.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O', 'Mesarosova, A', 'Cap, J']","['Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O', 'Mesarosova A', 'Cap J']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (nucleolar organizer region associated proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1995;42(6):299-305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As survival times increase, solid tumors are emerging as a serious long-term complication. METHODS: The Late Effects Study Group followed a cohort of 1380 children with Hodgkin's disease to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and the risk factors associated with them. RESULTS: In this cohort, there were 88 second neoplasms as compared with 4.4 expected in the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 18.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 14.3 to 22.3). The estimated actuarial incidence of any second neoplasm 15 years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was 7.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 8.8 percent); the incidence of solid tumors was 3.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 5.5 percent). Breast cancer was the most common solid tumor (standardized incidence ratio 75.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 118.4), with an estimated actuarial incidence in women that approached 35 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 52.6 percent) by 40 years of age. Older age (10 to 16 vs. <10 years) at the time of radiation treatment (relative risk, 1.9) and a higher dose (2000 to 4000 vs. <2000 cGy) of radiation (relative risk, 5.9) were associated with significantly increased risk of breast cancer. The estimated actuarial incidence of leukemia reached a plateau of 2.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 4.8 percent) 14 years after diagnosis. Treatment with alkylating agents, older age at the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, recurrence of Hodgkin's disease, and a late stage of disease at diagnosis were risk factors for leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of solid tumors, especially breast cancer, is high among women who were treated with radiation for childhood Hodgkin's disease. Systematic screening for breast cancer could be important in the health care of such women.","['Bhatia, S', 'Robison, L L', 'Oberlin, O', 'Greenberg, M', 'Bunin, G', 'Fossati-Bellani, F', 'Meadows, A T']","['Bhatia S', 'Robison LL', 'Oberlin O', 'Greenberg M', 'Bunin G', 'Fossati-Bellani F', 'Meadows AT']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",1996/03/21 00:00,1996/03/21 00:01,['1996/03/21 00:00'],"['1996/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199603213341201 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1996 Mar 21;334(12):745-51. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199603213341201.,"['N Engl J Med. 1996 Mar 21;334(12):791-2.

TNF-alpha dose-dependently induces SP, an induction that is secondary to an increase in the SP precursor, preprotachykinin (PPT), mRNA. Since TNF-alpha conditioned medium (CM) mimics the effect of TNF-alpha by raising SP, actions that are not antagonized by a neutralizing TNF-alpha antibody, TNF-alpha induction of SP is mediated by a soluble intermediate or intermediates. The blockade of TNF-alpha action by a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist and the induction of IL-1 mRNA by TNF-alpha suggest that IL-1 is one of the intermediates. Moreover, because immunoprecipitation with LIF antibodies decreases SP-inducing activity of TNF-alpha CM, and because LIF mRNA is also induced by TNF-alpha, LIF is a second intermediate. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-induced LIF mRNA is blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist, whereas IL-1-induced LIF mRNA is not affected by TNF-alpha antibodies, suggesting that TNF-alpha first induces IL-1, and IL-1 subsequently induces LIF. These data suggest that TNF-alpha induces SP in sympathetic ganglia through the sequential inductions of IL-1 and LIF.","['Ding, M', 'Hart, R P', 'Jonakait, G M']","['Ding M', 'Hart RP', 'Jonakait GM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Substance P/*biosynthesis', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.480280405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1995 Dec;28(4):445-54. doi: 10.1002/neu.480280405.,,,,"['MH 00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 30560/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular ATP depletion caused a significant decrease in the translational mobility of cell surface transferrin receptors and a significant increase in the number of receptors on the cell surface. ATP repletion restored receptor translational mobility and cell surface expression to control values. Inhibition of ATP hydrolases by orthovanadate also immobilized cell surface transferrin receptors and altered cell surface receptor expression, in a concentration-dependent manner. Vanadate-induced changes in receptor mobility and cell surface expression were reversible upon washing out the drug. Cellular ATP depletion did not affect the translational mobility of plasma membrane glycophorins or a fluorescent phospholipid analogue. We conclude that the translational movement of cell surface transferrin receptors specifically requires metabolic energy and ATP hydrolysis.","['Thatte, H S', 'Bridges, K R', 'Golan, D E']","['Thatte HS', 'Bridges KR', 'Golan DE']","[""Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199602)166:2<446::AID-JCP23>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199602)166:2<446::AID-JCP23>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Feb;166(2):446-52. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199602)166:2<446::AID-JCP23>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,"['HL-15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,
