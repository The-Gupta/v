Jurkat cells treated with DPCPX underwent apoptosis as demonstrated by flow cytometry, by DNA fragmentation and by accumulation of histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, in the nucleoplasm of cells. Cell cycle and cell sorting analyses indicated an arrest of cells in G(2)/M followed by the appearance of apoptotic cells in G(1) and G(2)/M phases. The mechanism of programmed cell death does not seem to be mediated by signal transduction events at the plasma membrane since it did not involve activation of cell membrane receptors and modification of the intracellular levels of Ca(2+) or cAMP. Apoptosis by incorporation into DNA of a derivative of DPCPX is suggested in basis of the presence of radioactivity label in the DNA obtained from cells preincubated with [(3)H]DPCPX.","['Mirabet, M', 'Mallol, J', 'Lluis, C', 'Franco, R']","['Mirabet M', 'Mallol J', 'Lluis C', 'Franco R']","['Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular, Facultat de Quimica, Universitat de Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/10/14 05:01,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [received]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/14 05:01 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400291 [doi]', '4400291 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1997 Oct;4(7):639-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400291.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show for the first time that photodynamic therapy (PDT), using benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD-MA, verteporfin) as the photosensitizer, induces the complete cleavage and subsequent activation of caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/Apopain) but not caspase-1 (ICE) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the catalytic subunit of DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA PK(CS)) were cleaved within 60 min of light activation of BPD-MA. The general caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-2,6 dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (Z-Asp-DCB) blocked PARP cleavage while the serine protease inhibitors 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) and N-tosyl-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) blocked the cleavage of caspase-3 suggesting that they act upstream of caspase-3 activation. All three inhibitors were able to block DNA fragmentation that was induced by treatment with BPD-MA followed by light application.

Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that these two properties of Bcr - Abl are derived from cooperative but distinct signaling pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which has been suggested to associate with and become activated by Bcr - Abl, has been shown to be required for Bcr - Abl-mediated cell growth. Also, PI3K has been implicated in resistance to apoptosis induced by some growth factors. We therefore examined the role of PI 3-kinase in the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcr - Abl. First, we confirmed that expression of p185(bcr - abl) in HL-60 cells, which renders these cells resistant to apoptosis, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. Consistent with this result, we observed a 20-fold increase in PI3K activity upon immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cells expressing Bcr - Abl versus control cells. Nevertheless, treatment of HL-60.p185(bcr - abl) cells with wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, eliminated PI3K activity but did not interfere with the resistance of these cells to apoptosis. Similar results were obtained with the CML line K562 and with the BaF3.p185 (bcr - abl) line. We conclude that while PI3K participates in the anti-apoptotic response mediated by some growth factors and also seems to be important for the growth of Bcr-Abl-positive cells, it does not play any role in Bcr - Abl-mediated resistance to apoptosis.","['Amarante-Mendes, G P', 'Jascur, T', 'Nishioka, W K', 'Mustelin, T', 'Green, D R']","['Amarante-Mendes GP', 'Jascur T', 'Nishioka WK', 'Mustelin T', 'Green DR']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, 10355 Science Center Dr, San Diego, California 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/10/14 05:01,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [received]', '1999/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '1999/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/14 05:01 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400276 [doi]', '4400276 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1997 Oct;4(7):548-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400276.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amifostine protects from apoptosis in some models and has been used as hematopoiesis stimulator in myeloid malignancies. As the apoptosis induced by many antitumoral agents is mediated by p53, we studied the effect of amifostine on p53-mediated apoptosis. We used human myeloid leukemia K562 and NB4 cells expressing the temperature-conditional p53-Val(135) mutant. Both cell lines undergo apoptosis at 32 degrees C due to the presence of p53 in wild-type conformation. We found that amifostine dramatically reduced apoptosis by p53 in both cell lines, as assessed by cell morphology, annexin V binding, fraction of sub-G(1) cells, and DNA laddering. To explore the mechanism responsible for this apoptosis protection, we tested the effect of amifostine on p53 transcriptional activity. We found that amifostine reduced p53-mediated transactivation of target promoters in NB4 and K562. Macroarray analysis confirmed that several p53 target genes as p21(Waf1), mdm2, gadd45, pig8, and pig3 were down-regulated at the mRNA level by amifostine in NB4 and K562. Also, c-myc was up-regulated by amifostine in K562 in the presence of p53, consistently with the impairment of p53-mediated apoptosis exerted by c-Myc in these cells. We conclude that amifostine impairs p53-dependent apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells by reducing the activation of apoptosis-related genes. Our results open the possibility that amifostine could reduce the effectiveness of antitumoral treatments when it is dependent on active p53.","['Acosta, Juan C', 'Richard, Carlos', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Horita, Machiko', 'Rizzo, M Giulia', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose L', 'Leon, Javier']","['Acosta JC', 'Richard C', 'Delgado MD', 'Horita M', 'Rizzo MG', 'Fernandez-Luna JL', 'Leon J']","['Grupo de Biologia Molecular del Cancer, Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Unidad de Biomedicina-CSIC, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Sep;2(9):893-900.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that EVI1 activates the E2F1 promoter in NIH3T3 cells but not in BRG1-negative SW13 cells. Ectopic expression of BRG1 is able to repress the E2F1 promoter in vector-transfected SW13 cells but not in EVI1-transfected SW13 cells. Finally, we show that EVI1 up-regulates cell proliferation in BRG1-positive 32Dcl3 cells but not in BRG1-negative SW13 cells.

The compound is being evaluated currently in Phase II and III clinical trials. Here we characterized the effects and mechanisms of action of bortezomib in cells obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We exposed isolated CLL lymphocytes from >100 patients to various concentrations of bortezomib or other proapoptotic stimuli, and measured DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. We characterized the effects of bortezomib on release of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial factors and measured downstream effects on caspase activation using a fluorogenic substrate cleavage assay. We assessed potential effects of the drug on inhibitor of apoptosis protein family apoptosis inhibitors by immunoblotting. Finally, we quantified the effects of bortezomib on apoptosis in 5 patients on a Phase II clinical trial. RESULTS: Bortezomib stimulated apoptosis more rapidly than positive controls (glucocorticoid and fludarabine), although substantial heterogeneity was noted with respect to the concentration of drug required to induce cell death. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis was associated with release of SMAC, apoptosis-inducing factor, and cytochrome c from mitochondria, but the drug did not affect levels of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family cell death inhibitors. Levels of apoptosis were marginally elevated in CLL cells obtained from 2 of 5 fludarabine-refractory patients treated with bortezomib in vivo.

POH also selectively induces G(1) arrest and apoptosis in Bcr/Abl-transformed hematopoietic cells. Because signaling through Ras is necessary for Bcr/Abl transformation, we examined whether POH induces its anti-leukemia effect by inhibiting Ras signaling. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The ability of POH to inhibit posttranslational farnesylation and signaling from Ras as well as signaling through the Raf-Mek-Erk cascade was examined in Bcr/Abl-transformed and mock-transformed cells and related to the anti-leukemia effect of POH. RESULTS: POH does not affect Ras prenylation or Ras activity, but it blocks signaling downstream of Ras by reversing the state of activation of the Erk kinase, Mek. POH affects Mek activity only when it is added to intact cells. Treatment of either cell lysates or of purified Mek with POH has no effect on Mek activity. Inhibition of the Mek-Erk pathway seems to be related to the POH anti-leukemia effect for the following reasons: (a) the concentration of POH needed to block the Erk pathway, as well the kinetics with which POH inhibits this signaling cascade, both correlate with the anti-leukemia effect of POH; (b) both U0126 (a specific Mek inhibitor) and POH induce similar anti-leukemia effects; and (c) mock-transformed hematopoietic cells are simultaneously resistant to POH anti-leukemia effects and inhibition of the Mek-Erk pathway.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of the Hsp90-inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) on cell growth, expression of signal transduction kinases, apoptosis, FLT3 phosphorylation and interaction with Hsp90 was determined in FLT3(+) human leukemias. RESULTS: We found that FLT3 is included in a multiprotein complex that includes Hsp90 and p23. 17-AAG inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation and interaction with Hsp90. FLT3(+) leukemias were significantly more sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG and Herbimycin A in cell growth assays than FLT3-negative leukemias. Cells transfected with FLT3 became sensitive to 17-AAG. Cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis were induced by 17-AAG. Cells with constitutive expression of FLT3, as a result of internal tandem duplication, were the most sensitive; cells with wild-type FLT3 were intermediate in sensitivity, and FLT3-negative cells were the least sensitive. 17-AAG resulted in reduced cellular mass of FLT3, RAF, and AKT. The mass of another Hsp, Hsp70, was increased. The expression level of MLL-AF4 fusion protein was not reduced by 17-AAG in human leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3(+) leukemias are sensitive to 17-AAG and Herbimycin A. 17-AAG inhibits leukemia cells with either FLT3-internal tandem duplication or wild-type FLT3, in part through destabilization of client kinases including FLT3, RAF, and AKT. 17-AAG is potentially useful for therapy of FLT3-expressing leukemias, including the mixed lineage leukemia fusion gene leukemias.","['Yao, Qing', 'Nishiuchi, Ritsuo', 'Li, Quanzhi', 'Kumar, Ashish R', 'Hudson, Wendy A', 'Kersey, John H']","['Yao Q', 'Nishiuchi R', 'Li Q', 'Kumar AR', 'Hudson WA', 'Kersey JH']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/10/14 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 1;9(12):4483-93.,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.3 (Prostaglandin-E Synthases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Stability/*drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prostaglandin-E Synthases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",['CA87053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the availability of sensitive methods, naturally occurring T cells directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be frequently detected in cancer patients. In this review, we summarize the current data on T cell responses to TAAs in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer. T cell responses against various antigens, including melanoma differentiation antigens, carcinoembryonic antigen, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, her-2/neu, Wilms' tumor protein, proteinase 3, NY-ESO-1, and surviving, have been reported in a substantial number of patients. In contrast, other TAAs, including most antigens of the MAGE family, do not usually elicit spontaneous T cell responses. A distinction between direct ex vivo T cell responses and in vitro-generated T cell responses is provided because in vitro stimulation results in quantitative and functional changes of T cell responses. The possible role of TAA-specific T cells in immunosurveillance and tumor escape and the implications for immunological treatment strategies are discussed. Naturally occurring T cells against TAAs are a common phenomenon in tumor patients. Understanding the mechanisms and behavior of natural TAA-specific T cells could provide crucial information for rational development of more efficient T cell-directed immunotherapy.","['Nagorsen, Dirk', 'Scheibenbogen, Carmen', 'Marincola, Francesco M', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Keilholz, Ulrich']","['Nagorsen D', 'Scheibenbogen C', 'Marincola FM', 'Letsch A', 'Keilholz U']","['Immunogenetics Section, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/10/14 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 1;9(12):4296-303.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,

EMA is also expressed in plasma cells, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1 antigen), malignant histiocytosis and erythroleukaemia. In 1996, Cheong et al. (Hematology 1996; 1: 223) demonstrated the positive expression of EMA in monoblasts. Since there were very few useful markers for differentiating subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia with a monocytic component from the those without, a study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of EMA expression and its relationship with known markers for monocytic-macrophage lineage (CD11c, CD14 and intracellular CD68) in monocytes and monoblasts. METHODS: EMA detection was performed by flow cytometry in monocytes and monoblasts. EMA expression was compared with other known markers of monocytic-macrophage lineage (CD11c, CD14 and intracellular CD68). Samples of purified monocytes were obtained from 20 healthy volunteers. Twenty-two cases of monocytic AML (M4 and M5) were studied and controls were selected from 20 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 18 cases of non-monocytic AML (M0, M1, M2, M3, and M7). RESULTS: EMA was shown to be expressed strongly on the surface of all purified monocytes. EMA expression was observed on blast cells in 18/22 (81.8%) cases of AML M4 and M5, but not in that of non-monocytic AML or ALL. In this study EMA monoclonal antibody has demonstrated a strong association (P<0.001) with all the other known markers of monocytic-macrophage lineage in acute leukaemia subtypes. EMA had also shown 100% specificity and 81.8% sensitivity in the diagnosis of AML M4 and M5. CONCLUSIONS: The monoclonal antibody EMA (clone E29) is a useful marker in the classification of acute myeloid leukaemia and can be used as a supplementary analysis for the diagnosis of acute leukemia with monocytic involvement.","['Leong, Chooi-Fun', 'Raudhawati, Osman', 'Cheong, Soon-Keng', 'Sivagengei, Kulaveerasingam', 'Noor Hamidah, Hussin']","['Leong CF', 'Raudhawati O', 'Cheong SK', 'Sivagengei K', 'Noor Hamidah H']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,2003/10/14 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['N2B2VP3K46WE6QM2 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020310001602576 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2003 Oct;35(5):422-7. doi: 10.1080/00313020310001602576.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Mucin-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mucin-1/analysis/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expressions of c-Myc protein and c-myc mRNA after X-irradiation were analysed by Western blotting and RT-PCR between radiosensitive MOLT-4 and radioresistant variant Rh-1a cells with less JNK activation than the parental cells. Apoptotic cell death was determined by a dye exclusion test, the appearance of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. The effect of a JNK activator anisomycin or c-Myc inhibitor peptides (Int-H1-S6A, F8A) on the amount of c-Myc protein and on the induction of apoptosis was investigated, respectively. RESULTS: In X-irradiated MOLT-4 cells, amounts of both c-myc mRNA and c-Myc protein rapidly decreased, which was followed by apoptotic cell death, while little change or limited reduction of c-Myc protein was observed in X-irradiated Rh-1a cells with accompanying higher cell viability. Exposure of MOLT-4 and Rh-1a cells to c-Myc inhibitor peptides similarly induced apoptotic cell death with decreases of c-Myc protein. Anisomycin rapidly induced JNK activation and a subsequent decrease of c-Myc protein, causing cell death in MOLT-4 cells. On the other hand, Rh-1a cells were more resistant to anisomycin than parental MOLT-4 cells, showing less JNK activation and a delayed decrease of c-Myc protein. CONCLUSION: A decrease of c-Myc protein was considered important in X-ray-induced apoptotic cell death of MOLT-4 cells; activation of the JNK pathway caused reduction in the amounts of c-myc mRNA and c-Myc protein, and finally induced apoptotic cell death.","['Enomoto, A', 'Suzuki, N', 'Kang, Y', 'Hirano, K', 'Matsumoto, Y', 'Zhu, J', 'Morita, A', 'Hosoi, Y', 'Sakai, K', 'Koyama, H']","['Enomoto A', 'Suzuki N', 'Kang Y', 'Hirano K', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Zhu J', 'Morita A', 'Hosoi Y', 'Sakai K', 'Koyama H']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['N4NL742395588HBE [pii]', '10.1080/09553000310001597273 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2003 Aug;79(8):589-600. doi: 10.1080/09553000310001597273.,"['0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Anisomycin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'X-Rays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repeated exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength range 340-400 nm (so-called ultraviolet A1) was recently reported to have a strong local (intracutaneous) immunomodulatory activity. This study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy and safety of this phototherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine patients with cutaneous (4 lichenoid and 5 sclerodermoid) GVHD and mild or no other organ involvement were enrolled. All patients had developed serious drug toxicity and/or opportunistic infections. Phototherapy was administered three times a week. RESULTS: Complete remission was seen in 5 (2 lichenoid and 3 sclerodermoid) cases and a partial improvement in 4 (2 lichenoid and 2 sclerodermoid) after having received 15.8+/-3.8 (lichenoid GVHD) or 21.6+/-8.0 (sclerodermoid GVHD) sessions of phototherapy. Adverse effects were not registered. At follow-up (range: 6-25 months), two patients with sclerodermoid lesions relapsed after 5 months but responded to another treatment cycle. Patients with lichenoid GVHD showed relapses within one month and prolonged maintenance phototherapy was needed. Problems of drug toxicity and opportunistic infections improved as phototherapy allowed the reduction or interruption of systemic drug therapies. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Ultraviolet A1 phototherapy may be considered as an appropriate therapeutic approach for sclerodermoid GVHD with no or mild involvement of internal organs. Patients with lichenoid GVHD should be treated only if they develop serious adverse effects to immunosuppressive therapies and opportunistic infections because of the carcinogenic hazard of high cumulative doses of ultraviolet A1 radiation.","['Calzavara Pinton, Piergiacomo', 'Porta, Fulvio', 'Izzi, Teodosio', 'Venturini, Marina', 'Capezzera, Rossana', 'Zane, Cristina', 'Notarangelo, Luigi Daniele']","['Calzavara Pinton P', 'Porta F', 'Izzi T', 'Venturini M', 'Capezzera R', 'Zane C', 'Notarangelo LD']","['Department of Dermatology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. calzavar@bshosp.osp.unibs.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2003/10/14 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Oct;88(10):1169-75.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lichenoid Eruptions/*etiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'PUVA Therapy/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Scleroderma, Localized/*etiology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tried to evaluate the incidence of genital tract involvement and whether there are specific risk factors. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in order to describe genital manifestations of GVHD and evaluate its incidence, severity and remission among 213 females who underwent BMT. The risk factors studied were previous pregnancies, vaginal cultures just before BMT and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). RESULTS: Genital lesions considered as expression of GVHD were found in 53 patients (24.9%). They appeared in the first 100 days after BMT in 12 women and beyond in 41 cases. Seventy-three percent of patients with such lesions showed some evidence of chronic GVHD elsewhere. The proposed grading, the first attempt of its kind, showed that genital chronic GVHD was minimal in 66%, moderate in 22% and severe in 12% of patients. Vaginal fibrosis, sometimes with complete obstruction, was seen in this last form. This occurred in 86.8% of patients after 2-157 months (median 22) while persistent GVHD was observed in 7 of them. In our sample no significant association was found between genital GVHD and previous pregnancies or vaginal infections at BMT, while HRT seems poorly associated with gynecological manifestations of GVHD (p=0.049). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Genital GVHD is not unusual after BMT. It can seriously affect female sexuality and the overall quality of life.

The aim of the study was to determine the origin of platelet FV. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated a FV Leiden heterozygous patient who had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a normal donor. The patient had been referred to our laboratory for his marked activated protein C (APC) resistance in the apparent absence of FV Leiden. Analysis of the DNA from a buccal swab showed that the patient was indeed a heterozygous carrier of FV Leiden. The difference in FV genotype between the hepatocytes (heterozygous FV Leiden) and the blood cells (homozygous normal) of the patient provided a good model to investigate the origin of platelet FV. Platelets were isolated from the patient and the bone marrow donor and activated with thrombin and ionomycin to release and activate FV. APC was then added and the inactivation of platelet FVa was followed over time with a highly sensitive prothrombinase-based assay. RESULTS: While the donor's platelet FVa showed a normal inactivation time course, the patient's platelet FVa was considerably resistant to APC. The kinetic pattern of APC-catalyzed inactivation of the patient's platelet FVa was indistinguishable from that of plasma FVa from a FV Leiden heterozygote. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that platelet FV is derived from plasma and that endogenous FV synthesis by megakaryocytes contributes negligibly to the platelet FV pool.","['Thomassen, M Christella L G D', 'Castoldi, Elisabetta', 'Tans, Guido', 'Magdeleyns, Elke J P', 'Delaunoit, Christian', 'Debusscher, Louisette', 'Van Assche, Kris J A J', 'Rosing, Jan']","['Thomassen MC', 'Castoldi E', 'Tans G', 'Magdeleyns EJ', 'Delaunoit C', 'Debusscher L', 'Van Assche KJ', 'Rosing J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2003/10/14 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Oct;88(10):1150-6.,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (factor V Leiden)', '0 (platelet factor V)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)']",IM,"['Activated Protein C Resistance/blood', 'Adult', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Factor V/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Point Mutation/genetics/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/pathology', 'Protein C/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of imatinib treatment in chronic-phase CML patients resistant or intolerant to interferon (IFN) and the factors predicting therapeutic response and progression-free survival were analyzed. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients with chronic-phase CML resistant (n=111) or intolerant (n=39) to IFN were treated with imatinib. Prognostic factors for response and disease progression were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median time from diagnosis was 43 months (0.5-188), median IFN therapy 21.5 months (0.5-140) and median follow-up from starting imatinib 13.6 months (range: 3-23). Complete hematologic response was achieved in 96 of 97 patients. Complete, partial and minor cytogenetic responses were present in 44%, 22%, and 8% of patients at 12 months. Grade III-IV neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia developed in 33%, 16%, and 6% of patients, respectively. Sixty-five patients discontinued treatment for a median of 4 weeks (1-36) due to toxicity. The rate of progression-free survival (lack of accelerated/blastic phase with persistent response) was 89.2% (95% CI: 84-94.4) at 12 months and 80.2% (95% CI: 72.2-88.2) at 18 months. Platelets > 450x10(9)/L and treatment discontinuation > 4 weeks were associated with a lower rate of major (complete plus partial) cytogenetic response. Patients in Sokal's high-risk group and those who did not achieve a major cytogenetic response had significantly shorter progression-free survival.

The distribution of cytoskeletal proteins was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Actin was also studied by confocal microscopy and at the ultrastructural level. Changes in the distribution of cytoskeletal proteins were found to be dose-dependent and appeared to be more intense in HL-60 cells. Etoposide- and doxorubicin-treated cells showed similar changes in the distribution of F-actin, vimentin and tubulin. The reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins seemed to be consistent with features of apoptosis. An increase in bright staining of F-actin, vimentin and tubulin at the site of apoptotic bodies formation was observed. Immunogold labeling of actin in HL-60 cells was associated with features typical for apoptosis, i.e. compaction and margination of nuclear chromatin. K-562 cells showed cytoplasmic actin-positivity in the cytoplasm. Significant changes in morphology of HL-60 cells were found in the following concentrations: etoposide 20, 200 microM; doxorubicin 5, 10 microM and taxol 2-10 microM. The investigated proteins seemed to be involved in the above-reported apoptotic changes. Bright staining of F-actin, vimentin and tubulin, concentrated at the site of apoptotic bodies formation might suggested importance of these proteins for this process. Moreover, the increase in actin labeling in areas of chromatin compaction and margination of nuclear chromatin especially in HL-60 cells, which are more susceptible to apoptosis might implicate that actin might be involved in the chromatin remodeling during apoptosis.","['Grzanka, A', 'Grzanka, D', 'Orlikowska, M']","['Grzanka A', 'Grzanka D', 'Orlikowska M']","['Institute of Biology and Environment Protection, Bydgoszcz University of Kazimierz Wielki, Chodkiewicza 51, 85-667 Bydgoszcz, Poland. grzanka@ab-byd.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520300532X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00532-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Oct 15;66(8):1611-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00532-x.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Actins/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cytoskeleton/*pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Tubulin/*physiology']",,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from Curcuma longa, has shown strong antioxidant and anticancer properties and also the ability to regulate a wide variety of genes that require activating protein 1 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effect of curcumin on the expression of GSTP1-1 mRNA as well as protein, and we correlated this inhibition with the apoptotic effect of curcumin on K562 leukemia cells. Curcumin efficiently inhibited the tumour necrosis factor alpha- and phorbol ester-induced binding of AP-1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors to sites located on the GSTP1-1 gene promoter. TNFalpha-induced GSTP1-1 promoter activity was also inhibited by curcumin as shown by reporter gene assay. In parallel, curcumin induced pro-caspases 8 and 9 as well as poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage and thus leading to apoptosis in K562 cells. Our results overall add a novel role for curcumin as this chemoprotective compound could contribute to induce apoptosis by its ability to inhibit the GSTP1-1 expression at the level of transcription.","['Duvoix, Annelyse', 'Morceau, Franck', 'Delhalle, Sylvie', 'Schmitz, Martine', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Galteau, Marie-Madeleine', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Duvoix A', 'Morceau F', 'Delhalle S', 'Schmitz M', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Galteau MM', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Cancer et les Maladies du Sang, Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg, 162A Avenue de la Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520300501X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00501-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Oct 15;66(8):1475-83. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00501-x.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In yeast two-hybrid screens of a human lymph node derived cDNA expression library, we identified the human nucleoporin Nup98 as a highly specific and potent interactor of the Rev NES. Using an extensive panel of nuclear export positive and negative mutants of the functionally homologous NESs of the HIV-1 Rev, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Rex, and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Rev proteins, physiologically significant interaction of hNup98 with the various NESs was demonstrated. Missense mutations in the yeast nuclear export factor Crm1p that abrogated Rev NES interaction with the XXFG repeat-containing nucleoporin, Rab/hRIP, had minimal effects on the interaction of GLFG repeat-containing hNup98. Functional analysis of Nup98 domains required for nuclear localization demonstrated that the entire ORF was required for efficient incorporation into the nuclear envelope. A putative nuclear localization signal was identified downstream of the GLFG repeat region. Whereas overexpression of both full-length Nup98 and the amino-terminal GLFG repeat region, but not the unique carboxy-terminal region, induced significant suppression of HIV unspliced RNA export, lower levels of exogenous Nup98 expression resulted in a relatively modest increase in unspliced RNA export. These results suggest a physiological role for hNup98 in modulating Rev-dependent RNA export during HIV infection.","['Kiss, A', 'Li, L', 'Gettemeier, T', 'Venkatesh, L K']","['Kiss A', 'Li L', 'Gettemeier T', 'Venkatesh LK']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, 3681 Park Avenue, Saint Louis, MO 63108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682203005312 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00531-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Sep 30;314(2):591-600. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00531-2.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rev/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",['CA-73474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of p180(Gag-Pol), facilitated normally in mammalian cells by readthrough of the p65(Gag) termination codon, also occurs efficiently in insect cells to provide a source of the MLV protease and a pattern of p65(Gag) processing similar to that observed in mammalian cells. VLP release from p180(Gag-Pol)-expressing cells however remains essentially immature with disproportionate levels of the uncleaved p65(Gag) precursor when compared to the intracellular Gag profile. Changing the p65(Gag) termination codon altered the level of p65(Gag) and p180(Gag-Pol) within expressing cells but did not alter the pattern of released VLP, which remained immature. Coexpression of p65(Gag) with a fixed readthrough p180(Gag-Pol) also led to only immature VLP release despite high intracellular protease levels. Our data suggest a mechanism that preferentially selects uncleaved p65(Gag) for the assembly of MLV in this heterologous expression system and implies that, in addition to their relative levels, active sorting of the correct p65(Gag) and p180(Gag-Pol) ratios may occur in producer cells.","['Adamson, Catherine S', 'Davies, Adam', 'Soneoka, Yuko', 'Nermut, Milan', 'Mitrophanous, Kyriacos', 'Jones, Ian M']","['Adamson CS', 'Davies A', 'Soneoka Y', 'Nermut M', 'Mitrophanous K', 'Jones IM']","['School of Animal and Microbial Sciences, The University of Reading, Reading, RD6 6AJ, UK. c.s.adamson@rdg.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682203004859 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00485-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Sep 30;314(2):488-96. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00485-9.,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nucleopolyhedroviruses/genetics/metabolism', 'Spodoptera/virology', 'Virion/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Virus Assembly']",,,,['Virology. 2003 Dec 20;317(2):384-6'],,,,,,,,,,,

In these new isolates, the orf50/orf51 alleles of the respective subgroup segregate with the stp and/or tip oncogene alleles, which are essential for transformation.","['Ensser, Armin', 'Thurau, Mathias', 'Wittmann, Sabine', 'Fickenscher, Helmut']","['Ensser A', 'Thurau M', 'Wittmann S', 'Fickenscher H']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682203004495 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00449-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Sep 30;314(2):471-87. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00449-5.,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 2, Saimiriine/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Saimiri/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ410475', 'GENBANK/AJ410476', 'GENBANK/AJ410477', 'GENBANK/AJ410478', 'GENBANK/AJ410479', 'GENBANK/AJ410480', 'GENBANK/AJ410481', 'GENBANK/AJ410482', 'GENBANK/AJ410483', 'GENBANK/AJ410484', 'GENBANK/AJ410485', 'GENBANK/AJ410486', 'GENBANK/AJ410487', 'GENBANK/AJ410488', 'GENBANK/AJ410489', 'GENBANK/AJ410490', 'GENBANK/AJ410491', 'GENBANK/AJ410492']",,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed 46.3% of patients with clonal chromosomal alterations by conventional cytogenetics and 80.7% by FISH. Trisomy 12 was found in 21.9% of patients by G-banding analysis and in 35% by FISH studies. Allelic loss of 13q14 was observed in 63.2% patients, most of them showing D13S319 and D13S25 deletion; 11% of patients showed TP53 monosomy. Coexistence of trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion was found in 17.5% of patients. In this group, deletion 13q14 was the prevalent clone, with percentages 25-35% higher than those observed for trisomy 12, suggesting clonal evolution. The coexistence of trisomy 12 with deletion 13q14 was observed in a higher frequency than reported in the literature.

Tumor suppressor genes TP53 and CDKN2A were downregulated and protooncogenes JUN and GRB10 were upregulated. Furthermore, several cellular signaling pathways acting either in cell cycle regulation or in apoptosis were altered. Deregulation was found in pathways that contribute to genomic stability (by downregulation of either TP53 or CSE1L and by upregulation of GADD45A) and regulate cell cycle progression (by downregulation of CDKN2A and upregulation of RBBP4, CDC37, and NEDD5). Alterations at the transcriptional level were identified, namely, upregulation of JUN and E2F5. Abnormalities were observed in the regulation of the caspases through upregulation of CASP8 and by altered expression of BCL2-related pathway. Extrinsic apoptotic signals mediated by IGFs were deregulated and the glutathione detoxification pathway was downregulated. These findings provide insight into the regulation of balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation signals, and suggest that these genes and pathways may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Casas, Silvia', 'Ollila, Juha', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Vihinen, Mauno', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Knuutila, Sakari']","['Casas S', 'Ollila J', 'Aventin A', 'Vihinen M', 'Sierra J', 'Knuutila S']","['Departments of Pathology and Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute and Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,2003/10/14 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/10/14 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S016546080300102X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00102-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Oct 15;146(2):89-101. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00102-x.,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is desirable to develop new types of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors that may overcome this drug resistance problem. Here we present the discovery of novel inhibitors targeted at the catalytic domain of ABL tyrosine kinase by using three-dimensional database searching techniques. From a database containing 200,000 commercially available compounds, the top 1000 compounds with the best DOCK energy score were selected and subjected to structural diversity and drug likeness analysis, 15 compounds were submitted for biological assay. Eight out of the 15 showed inhibitory activity against K562 cells with IC(50) value ranging from 10 to 200 microM. Two promising compounds showed inhibition in further ABL tyrosine phosphorylation assay. It is anticipated that those two compounds can serve as lead compounds for further drug design and optimization.","['Peng, Hui', 'Huang, Niu', 'Qi, Jing', 'Xie, Ping', 'Xu, Chen', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Yang, Chunzheng']","['Peng H', 'Huang N', 'Qi J', 'Xie P', 'Xu C', 'Wang J', 'Yang C']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, P.R.

METHODS: The primary ectomesenchymal cells of E 50 human fetal facial processes were isolated by 2.5 g/L trypsin and cultured with DMEM/F 12 with 10(-6) U/L leukemia inhibitor factor(LIF). The morphology and growth rate were observed by inverted microscop. After being withdrawn LIF, the characteristic of cells were identified by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The cultured cells displayed monolayer growth and were fibroblast-like with 2-4 processes. The cells were stainely positived for anti-human natural killer cell marker-1, Vimentin, S-100, neuron specific enolase, myoglobin and VIII factor, but negatively for glial fibrillary acidic protein, neural fiblament, alpha-SMA and cytokeratin in immunohistochemistry. Two days after being withdrawn the LIF, cells expressed alpha-SMA in protein and mRNA levels. The cells were rich in muscular filament-like structure and dense bodies under transmission electron microscope. CONCLUSION: Cultured cells are undifferentiated ectomesenchymal stem cells. The cells have the potential for differentiating spontaneously to smooth muscle cell.","['Deng, Man-jing', 'Jin, Yan', 'Shi, Jun-nan']","['Deng MJ', 'Jin Y', 'Shi JN']","[""College of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, P.

Number of plaques resulted from the syncytium formation in XC cells by ecotropic MLV infection is corresponding to number of the viral particles. XC cells had been established from a v-src-induced rat tumor. It has been reported that transformed cells are more sensitive to Mo-MLV-induced syncytium formation than non-transformed cells. To assess whether the transformation by v-src oncogene in XC cells is involved in the high sensitivity to ecotropic MLV-induced syncytium formation, XC cells were treated with genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Genistein suppressed the syncytium formation between XC cells and ecotropic Env-expressing 293T cells.

We present here the results of an inquiry sent to 47 German transplantation centers regarding the transfusion policy following autologous stem cell transplantation. The results of 35 answering centers are included. Ten out of 35 centers offer irradiated blood products lifelong to their patients, mainly for the prevention of mistransfusion of non-irradiated blood components to allogeneic recipients. Twenty-two out of 35 centers administer irradiated blood products for a special time span after autologous stem cell transplantation. In most centers, this time span is from 3 to 6 months. Only few centers (4/35) expand this time span to 1-2 years after transplantation. A minority of centers (3/35) gave non-irradiated blood products to all of their patients or to patients not suffering from acute leukemia or after total body irradiation (TBI) containing preparative regimens. Most centers (19/35) deliver irradiated blood products irrespective of the conditioning regimen. Fifty-three percent of the centers decide to donate irradiated blood products not depending on immunological reconstitution. But in most centers some kind of hematological reconstitution is a major criterion for termination of irradiated blood products. Sixty-four percent of the centers made no difference in transfusion policy in regard to the underlying disease. No center experienced cases of proofed TA-GVHD.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed overexpression of EVI1 in both cases, but excluded the presence of any CDK6/ EVI1 fusion transcript.

In this review, we compare the characteristics of the inhibition of PTK activity by beta-HIVS with those of other inhibitors of PTKs. The chemical structure of beta-HIVS is completely different from that of ATP and it does not resemble any of the PTK inhibitors reported to date, except that it includes the benzylidene moiety. In contrast to most PTK inhibitors, the mechanism of inhibition by beta-HIVS is non-competitive with respect to ATP, but competitive with respect to its peptide substrate. This feature of the mechanism of inhibition of PTK by beta-HIVS suggests that it might be useful in a clinical setting with other PTK inhibitors. When Bcr-Abl-positive, human leukemia K562 cells were treated simultaneously with beta-HIVS and STI571 (Gleevec), these compounds had a synergistic effect on both the induction of apoptosis in K562 cells and the inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of PTK, probably because the mechanism of interference with phosphorylation by beta-HIVS and the binding site of beta-HIVS are different from those of STI571.","['Nakaya, Kazuyasu', 'Miyasaka, Tadashi']","['Nakaya K', 'Miyasaka T']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan. nakaya@pharm.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,2003/10/11 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200310000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2003 Oct;14(9):683-93. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200310000-00002.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) differs by ethnicity is uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 6443) receiving HLA-identical sibling HSCT for acute or chronic leukemia in the United States or Canada between 1985 and 1999 and reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry were included. The survival of recipients reported as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian was compared using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for other clinical factors. Three 5-year periods were studied to evaluate changes over time. RESULTS: Hispanics compared with whites had lower 1-year (53% v 65%; P <.001) and 3-year adjusted survival rates (38% v 53%; P <.001) between 1995 and 1999, the most recent period studied. We failed to find significant differences in survival rates comparing whites with blacks or with Asians in any of the time periods.

Here we explored the molecular basis for the decrease or loss of hRFC gene expression in seventeen tumor cell lines with resistance to multiple antifolates due to impaired antifolate transport. We studied the role of various cis-acting elements including CRE/AP-1-like element and GC-box in hRFC promoters A and B, respectively, as well as AP-2, Mzf-1 and E-box that are contained within or near four tandemly repeated sequences upstream of promoter A. Decreased or abolished binding either to [32P]GC-box, Mzf-1, AP-1, E-box, or CRE oligonucleotides was detected in approximately 50-80% of antifolate-resistant cell lines. Strikingly, approximately 80% of the cell lines displayed a simultaneously decreased binding to three or more of these hRFC promoter elements, whereas normal AP-2 binding was retained. The possible contribution of promoter methylation to hRFC gene silencing was also explored. None of the antifolate-resistant cell lines, except for MDA-MB-231 cells, showed hRFC promoter methylation; consistently, MDA-MB-231 was the only cell line that retained binding to all six cis-acting elements. Western blot analysis demonstrated decreased expression of transcriptional activators (pCREB-1, pATF-1, USF-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, Sp1, and Sp3) and/or increased expression of repressors (short Sp3 isoforms), whereas normal AP2alpha levels were retained. Transient expression of the relevant transcription factors restored, at least partially, both promoter binding and hRFC gene expression. This is the first report that transcriptional silencing of the hRFC gene in multiple tumor cell lines with resistance to various novel antifolates is a result of a simultaneous loss of function of multiple transcription factors but not promoter methylation.","['Rothem, Lilah', 'Stark, Michal', 'Kaufman, Yotam', 'Mayo, Lior', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Rothem L', 'Stark M', 'Kaufman Y', 'Mayo L', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/11 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309092200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52825-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jan 2;279(1):374-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309092200.

We hypothesized that some of these proteins might physically and functionally interact and thus mechanistically link different diseases. The ETO protein of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an excellent candidate as a common factor because it is normally expressed in human hematopoietic cells, it binds to histone deacetylases (HDACs), and it interacts with the PLZF protein of t(11;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia. To determine whether ETO functionally links a broader range of disease entities, we asked whether ETO forms a complex with the Bcl-6 oncoprotein of B-cell lymphomas. We found that ETO and Bcl-6 are coexpressed in normal and malignant lymphoid tissue, where they interact and colocalize in nuclear speckles. ETO binds to the fourth zinc finger of Bcl-6, enhances Bcl-6 repression of artificial and endogenous genes in an HDAC-dependent manner, and forms a complex with Bcl-6 on the promoters of its endogenous target genes in B-cell lymphoma cells. Therefore, ETO is a bona fide corepressor that links the transcriptional pathogenesis of acute leukemias and B-cell lymphomas and offers a compelling target for transcriptional therapy of hematologic malignancies.","['Chevallier, Nathalie', 'Corcoran, Connie M', 'Lennon, Christine', 'Hyjek, Elizabeth', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Bardwell, Vivian J', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Melnick, Ari']","['Chevallier N', 'Corcoran CM', 'Lennon C', 'Hyjek E', 'Chadburn A', 'Bardwell VJ', 'Licht JD', 'Melnick A']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/11 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-2081 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50174-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 15;103(4):1454-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-2081.

EEN, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein in the endophilin family, has been implicated in endocytosis, although little is known about its role in leukemogenesis mediated by the MLL-EEN fusion protein. In this study, we have identified and characterized EBP, a novel EEN binding protein that interacts with the SH3 domain of EEN through a proline-rich motif PPERP. EBP is a ubiquitous protein that is normally expressed in the cytoplasm but is recruited to the nucleus by MLL-EEN with a punctate localization pattern characteristic of the MLL chimeric proteins. EBP interacts simultaneously with EEN and Sos, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. Coexpressoin of EBP with EEN leads to suppression of Ras-induced cellular transformation and Ras-mediated activation of Elk-1. Taken together, our findings suggest a new mechanism for MLL-EEN-mediated leukemogenesis in which MLL-EEN interferes with the Ras-suppressing activities of EBP through direct interaction.","['Yam, Judy Wai Ping', 'Jin, Dong-Yan', 'So, Chi Wai', 'Chan, Li Chong']","['Yam JW', 'Jin DY', 'So CW', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/11 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2452 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50173-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 15;103(4):1445-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2452.

Treatment with 17-AAG of the mast cell line HMC-1.2, harboring the Asp816Val and Val560Gly KIT mutations, and the cell line HMC-1.1, harboring a single Val560Gly mutation, causes both the level and activity of KIT and downstream signaling molecules AKT and STAT3 to be down-regulated following drug exposure. These data were validated using Cos-7 cells transfected with wild-type and mutated KIT. 17-AAG promotes cell death of both HMC mast cell lines. In addition, neoplastic mast cells isolated from patients with mastocytosis, incubated with 17-AAG ex vivo, are selectively sensitive to the drug compared to the mononuclear fraction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 15-year period at Stanford University Medical Center, 85 consecutive high-risk pediatric (up to age 17 years; n=41) and adult (age 18-55 years; n=44); patients with leukemia (ALL) in CR1 (n=55) and CR2 (n=30) received HLA-matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor grafts after being treated with FTBI (1320 cGy) and high-dose VP-16 (60 mg/kg) as their preparatory regimen. The majority of patients transplanted in CR1 (n=45) had high-risk features, including age above 30 years, white blood cell count at presentation exceeding 25000/microL, extramedullary disease, need for more than 4 weeks of induction chemotherapy to achieve CR, or high-risk chromosomal translocations. Most patients transplanted in CR1 were adults (n=39), whereas patients in CR2 were primarily children or adolescents (n=25). RESULTS: The 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse were significantly (p=0.05) lower in CR1 patients (15%+/-10%) than in CR2 patients (33%+/-20%). Relapse was the most common cause of treatment failure in patients transplanted in CR2. There was a significantly (p=0.05) higher rate of chronic graft-vs-host disease in CR1 (32%+/-14%) compared with CR2 (9%+/-11%) patients; however, overall survival for patients transplanted in CR1 (66%+/-14%) was comparable (p=0.67) to that of patients transplanted in CR2 (62%+/-19%). Event-free survival rates also were similar (p=0.53) between CR1 (64%+/-14%) and CR2 (61%+/-18%) patients. Treatment-related mortality rates were equivalent (p=0.51) between CR1 and CR2, as well as between Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive (Ph(+))and Ph(-) (p=0.23) ALL patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, FTBI/VP-16 is a highly effective preparatory regimen that provides durable remissions for patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for high-risk ALL in CR1 or CR2.","['Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Amylon, Michael D', 'Wong, Ruby M', 'Blume, Karl G']","['Jamieson CH', 'Amylon MD', 'Wong RM', 'Blume KG']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5623, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002315 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00231-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):981-6. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00231-5.,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",['P01 CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively monitored the kinetics of engrafting of T cells and myeloid cells in 10 consecutive adult patients with hematologic diseases submitted to NMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Patients were considered ineligible for conventional allogeneic transplantation because of age, concomitant diseases, or previous autologous transplant. Conditioning regimen and graft-vs-host disease posttransplant prophylaxis consisted of 2-Gy total-body irradiation plus fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 3 days, and cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively. RESULTS: One patient died in remission, and eight relapsed or progressed at a median of 68 days (15-335). On day +56, only 1 (11%) of 9 patients analyzed had achieved T-cell complete donor chimerism (CC), whereas 6 (67%) had achieved myeloid CC (p=0.05). Median time for T-cell CC to occur was 110 days (56-150) compared with 42 days (28-100) to achieve myeloid CC (p=0.002). The only parameter associated with T-cell CC was the status of the disease at the time of transplantation. Thus, 5 (100%) of 5 patients with stable disease or who were in remission before the transplant achieved T-cell CC compared with only 1 (20%) of 5 patients with progressive disease (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Conditioning regimen based on fludarabine and 2-Gy total-body irradiation allows cell immunotherapy for old and medically infirm patients, but its antitumoral effect in patients with progressive hematologic disease is limited.","['Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Martinez, Carmen', 'Talarn, Carme', 'Jimenez, Monica', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Aymerich M', 'Rovira M', 'Martinez C', 'Talarn C', 'Jimenez M', 'Carreras E', 'Montserrat E']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, IDIBAPS, Postgraduate School of Hematology Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002364 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00236-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):934-40. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00236-4.,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Diseases/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), donor NK cells might mediate graft-vs-host (GVH) reactions that promote donor chimerism and mediate anti-tumor effects. Additionally, recipient NK cells might mediate donor marrow rejection. We have developed a nonmyeloablative approach to haploidentical HCT involving recipient treatment with a T cell-depleting mAb, Medi-507, that can achieve donor engraftment and mixed hematopoietic chimerism without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are later administered in an effort to achieve graft-vs-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD. It is unknown whether NK cell ""tolerance"" develops in human mixed chimeras. METHODS: We have addressed these issues in 12 patients receiving Medi-507-based nonmyeloablative haploidentical HCT. RESULTS: NK cells recovered relatively early, despite the presence of circulating anti-CD2 mAb, but the majority of initially recovering cells lacked CD2 expression. These NK cells showed a reduced capacity, compared to those from normal donors, to kill class I-deficient targets. No association was detected between KIR mismatches in the host-vs-graft (HVG) or GVH direction and graft or tumor outcomes in this small series. NK cell chimerism did not correlate with chimerism in other lineages in mixed chimeras. NK cell tolerance to the host was not observed in a patient with full donor chimerism. One patient developed NK cell reactivity against donor-derived lymphoblast targets after loss of chimerism, despite the absence of an HVG KIR mismatch. CONCLUSION: Our results do not show an impact of NK cells on the outcome of nonmyeloablative, even T cell-depleted, HCT across haplotype barriers using an anti-CD2 mAb. Our data also raise questions about the applicability of observations made with NK cell clones to the bulk NK cell repertoire in humans.","['Koenecke, Christian', 'Shaffer, Juanita', 'Alexander, Stephen I', 'Preffer, Frederic', 'Dombkowski, David', 'Saidman, Susan L', 'Dey, Bimalanghu', 'McAfee, Steven', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Koenecke C', 'Shaffer J', 'Alexander SI', 'Preffer F', 'Dombkowski D', 'Saidman SL', 'Dey B', 'McAfee S', 'Spitzer TR', 'Sykes M']","['Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002248 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00224-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):911-23. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00224-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Host vs Graft Reaction', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', '*Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning']","['R01 CA79986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL63474/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transduction of donor lymphocytes with a herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene prior to infusion confers lethal sensitivity to the anti-herpes drug, ganciclovir (GCV). HSVtk-transduced donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have already been used and significant problems have limited the clinical experience to very few patients. To this end, we also report on a study of whether HSVtk-DLI induces GVHD/GVL and if infusion of GCV allows abrogation of GVHD by selective killing of donor lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were infused with HSVtk gene-modified donor lymphocytes. In brief, transgeneic lymphocytes were prepared by 3 days of activation, 1 day of transduction, 6 days of selection with G418, and 2 to 4 weeks of expansion. RESULTS: From 5.0 to 199 x 10(6) CD3(+) DLI were infused. There were no toxicities and no correlation between CD3(+) cell dose and either GVHD or GVL was observed. Only one patient who had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) developed GVHD and that same patient is the only patient to have an anti-tumor response. The patient was infused with 23 x 10(6) CD4(+) and 9.7 x 10(6) CD8(+) HSVtk DLI. Following discontinuation of immune suppression and infusion of GCV, GVHD promptly resolved. Although the CTCL relapsed, it has been easily controlled with intermittent topical therapy. One patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) had a remission inversion of undetermined significance. Two patients with AML, one patient with lymphoma, and four patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) did not respond. CONCLUSION: HSVtk-DLI may provide an anti-tumor effect in vivo and may induce GVHD that is abrogated by GCV treatment. While technical aspects to improve response need to be perfected, HSVtk-DLI infusion to induce a transient GVL/GVHD may become an effective future therapy to minimize complications of allogeneic HSCT.","['Burt, Richard K', 'Drobyski, William R', 'Seregina, Tatiana', 'Traynor, Ann', 'Oyama, Yu', 'Keever-Taylor, Carolyn', 'Stefka, Jacob', 'Kuzel, Timothy M', 'Brush, Mary', 'Rodriquez, Julianne', 'Burns, Willam', 'Tennant, Lucinda', 'Link, Charles']","['Burt RK', 'Drobyski WR', 'Seregina T', 'Traynor A', 'Oyama Y', 'Keever-Taylor C', 'Stefka J', 'Kuzel TM', 'Brush M', 'Rodriquez J', 'Burns W', 'Tennant L', 'Link C']","['Northwestern University School of Medicine, Division of Immunotherapy, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA. rburt@nwu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002261 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00226-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):903-10. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00226-1.,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Simplexvirus/*enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is, however, a significant cause of severe morbidity. To reduce the incidence of GVHD, we treated a group of high-risk patients with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen followed by in vitro T-cell-depleted alloSCT using Campath 1-H incubation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients were treated with fludarabine (6 x 30 mg/m(2)), busulphan (2 x 3.2 mg/kg), and ATG (4 x 10 mg/kg) followed by the infusion of high-dose T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cells from sibling donors. No posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis was administered. At 6 months after alloSCT, low-dose donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was administered. RESULTS: All patients had sustained engraftment of donor cells with a median of 95% donor cells at 3 months after alloSCT. Minimal acute and no chronic GVHD was observed after alloSCT. A high incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation but no CMV disease was observed. Eleven patients received DLI at a median of 6.5 months after alloSCT. Acute GVHD grade II-III developed in 6 patients. All patients showed improvement of donor chimerism after DLI. With a median follow-up of 211 days, 11 patients are alive. Particular in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, a significant graft-vs-tumor effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro T-cell-depleted alloSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning leads to durable donor engraftment without GVHD. The high levels of donor chimerism allow the subsequent use of cellular immunotherapy to treat residual disease.","['Barge, Renee M Y', 'Osanto, Susanne', 'Marijt, W A F Erik', 'Starrenburg, C W J Ingrid', 'Fibbe, Willem E', 'Nortier, J W R Hans', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Willemze, Roel']","['Barge RM', 'Osanto S', 'Marijt WA', 'Starrenburg CW', 'Fibbe WE', 'Nortier JW', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. barge.hematology@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002005 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00200-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):865-72. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00200-5.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a prospective randomized trial comparing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) vs PBPC transplantation (PBPCT) using CD34(+) selection for T-cell depletion (TCD) in both study arms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and October 2000, 120 patients with a diagnosis of acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma were randomized to receive either filgrastim-mobilized PBPC or BM from HLA-identical sibling donors after standard high-dose chemoradiotherapy. Patient characteristics did not differ between study arms. RESULTS: Recipients of PBPC received more CD3(+) T cells (median: 3.0 vs 2.0 x 10(5)/kg, p<0.0001) and more CD34(+) cells (median: 3.6 vs 0.9 x 10(6)/kg, p<0.0001). Neutrophil and platelet recoveries occurred significantly faster after PBPCT. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV was 37% after BMT vs 52% after PBPCT and was most significantly (p=0.007) affected by the number of CD3(+) T cells in the graft. Acute GVHD appeared strongly associated with increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) in a time-dependent analysis. Higher numbers of CD34(+) cells were associated with less TRM. With a median follow-up of 37 months (range: 12-75), overall survival at 4 years from transplantation was 60% after BMT and 34% for recipients of PBPCT (p=0.04), which difference was largely due to increased GVHD and TRM in PBPC recipients receiving T-cell dosages greater than 2 x 10(5)/kg. CONCLUSION: Outcome following T cell-depleted PBPCT critically depends on the number of CD3(+) T cells, whereby high T-cell numbers may blunt a favorable effect of higher CD34(+) cell numbers.","['Cornelissen, Jan J', 'van der Holt, Bronno', 'Petersen, Eefke J', 'Vindelov, Lars', 'Russel, Charlotte A', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Braakman, Eric', 'Steijaert, Monique M C', 'Zijlmans, Mark J M', 'Slaper-Cortenbach, Ineke', 'Boogaerts, Marc A', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Verdonck, Leo F']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'van der Holt B', 'Petersen EJ', 'Vindelov L', 'Russel CA', 'Hoglund M', 'Maertens J', 'Schouten HC', 'Braakman E', 'Steijaert MM', 'Zijlmans MJ', 'Slaper-Cortenbach I', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Verdonck LF']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.cornelissen@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03001954 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00195-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Oct;31(10):855-64. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00195-4.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown by immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analysis, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 was maximally induced within 12 h postlesion in motoneurons of the ipsilateral facial nucleus of wildtype mice and is maintained for at least 3 days. In CNTF(-/-) mouse mutants, activation of STAT3 signaling was delayed by 10-12 h. Application of CNTF to the transected nerve restored rapid STAT3 activation in CNTF-deficient animals, whereas application of colchicine suppressed STAT3 signaling in wildtype mice for at least 24 h. These results identify CNTF as an early retrograde signal in axotomized facial motoneurons by showing that CNTF released at the lesion site is responsible for the initial induction of STAT3 signaling.

The apoptotic effect of PUMA on the mitochondria was studied using a p53-negative, human leukemia K562 cell line. Overexpression of PUMA was accompanied by an increased Bax expression, Bax conformational change, and translocation to mitochondria. A PUMA-BH3 peptide can induce Bax conformational change, cytochrome c release, and reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in isolated K562 mitochondria and can be inhibited by Bcl-XL. The homo-dimer of Bax/Bax was also weakly shown after mitochondria were treated with PUMA-BH3 peptide but may not be lethal for PUMA-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Our results suggest that PUMA-induced Bax conformational change and Bax translocation to mitochondria can be separate events and the conformational change in Bax is crucial for PUMA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.","['Liu, Feng-Ting', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Jia, Li']","['Liu FT', 'Newland AC', 'Jia L']","[""Department of Haematology, Barts and the London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03018990 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Oct 24;310(3):956-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.109.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of resistin in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance associated with obesity in humans remains unclear. We comparatively and quantitatively studied the tissue distributions of resistin mRNA between human and mouse. The expression level of resistin mRNA in human adipose tissue is extremely low but detectable by real-time PCR and is about 1/250 of that in the mouse. Remarkably, resistin mRNA is abundant in human primary acute leukemia cells and myeloid cell lines U937 and HL60, but not in the Raw264 mouse myeloid cell line. Resistin expression in U937 cells was not affected by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by ciglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand. Phylogenomics revealed that the human resistin gene is the ortholog of its murine counterpart and is located in a region of chromosome 19p13.3, which is syntenic to mouse chromosome 8A1. In addition to the resistin-like molecule (RELM) sequences already reported, bioinformatics analysis disclosed another RELM sequence in the vicinity of RELMbeta on human chromosome 3q13.1, but this sequence is unlikely to encode an expressed gene. Therefore, only two RELMs, resistin and RELMbeta, exist in humans, instead of the three RELMs, resistin, RELMalpha, and RELMbeta, that exist in mice. This finding provides a possible answer to the question of why only two RELMs have been cloned in humans and suggests that the RELM family is not well conserved in evolution and may function differently between species. Therefore, caution should be exercised in interpreting resistin as a link between obesity and insulin resistance in humans. The high expression of resistin in human leukemia cells suggests a hitherto unidentified biological function of resistin in leukocytes.","['Yang, Rong-Ze', 'Huang, Qing', 'Xu, Aihua', 'McLenithan, John C', 'Eisen, Jonathan A', 'Shuldiner, Alan R', 'Alkan, Serhan', 'Gong, Da-Wei']","['Yang RZ', 'Huang Q', 'Xu A', 'McLenithan JC', 'Eisen JA', 'Shuldiner AR', 'Alkan S', 'Gong DW']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,2003/10/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03018928 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.093 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Oct 24;310(3):927-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.093.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hormones, Ectopic)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RETN protein, human)', '0 (RETNLB protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Resistin)', '0 (Retn protein, mouse)', '0 (Retnla protein, mouse)', '0 (Retnlb protein, mouse)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'U8QXS1WU8G (ciglitazone)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Genome', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hormones, Ectopic/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factor', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Resistin', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'U937 Cells']",['DK57835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Dec 19;312(3):866.

Conventional x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy, and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose whole-body positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were performed. All images showed alterations in the lower leg. Shortly after, an isolated relapse of the AML was diagnosed in the right elbow. FDG-PET demonstrated this lesion as well as an unknown lesion in the subcutis due to EML. In the course of her illness, the patient underwent one more PET examination for therapy control.

The incubation of cells with 1 micromol/l all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 72 h induced differentiation of HL-60 cells and increased the number of CD11b positive cells. Morphological and functional changes were accompanied by a loss of proliferative capacity. Differentiation caused by preincubation of leukemic cells HL-60 with ATRA is accompanied by loss of clonogenicity (control cells: 870 colonies/10(3) cells, cells preincubated with ATRA: 150 colonies/10(3) cells). D0 for undifferentiated cells was 2.35 Gy, for ATRA differentiated cells 2.46 Gy. Statistical comparison of clonogenity curves indicated that in the whole range 0.5-10 Gy the curves are not significantly different, however, in the range 0.5-3 Gy ATRA differentiated cells were significantly more radioresistant than non-differentiated cells. When HL-60 cells preincubated with 1 micromol/l ATRA were irradiated by a sublethal dose of 6 Gy, more marked increase of apoptotic cells number was observed 24 h after irradiation and the surviving cells were mainly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, while only irradiated cells were accumulated in G(2) phase. Our results imply that preincubation of cells with ATRA accelerates apoptosis occurrence (24 h) after irradiation by high sublethal dose of 6 Gy. Forty-eight hours after 6 Gy irradiation, late apoptotic cells were found in the group of ATRA pretreated cells, as determined by APO2.7 positivity. This test showed an increased effect (considering cell death induction) in comparison to ATRA or irradiation itself.","['Marekova, M', 'Vavrova, J', 'Vokurkova, D', 'Psutka, J']","['Marekova M', 'Vavrova J', 'Vokurkova D', 'Psutka J']","['Dept. of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine Hradec Kralove, Charles University Prague, Simkova 870, 500 01 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. marekova@lfhk.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Physiol Res,Physiological research,9112413,2003/10/11 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/10/11 05:00'],"['2003/10/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Physiol Res. 2003;52(5):599-606.,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (antigen 7A6)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is a potential modulator of antitumor responses, the significance of sCD86 in patients with hematologic malignancies is unknown. METHODS: The authors evaluated sCD86 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 57 patients) and patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 40 patients) and analyzed the relation between sCD86 levels and various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Levels of sCD86 were elevated (> 2.32 ng/mL) relative to normal donors (0.22-2.32 ng/mL; n = 51 patients) in 25% of patients with AML and in 27% of patients with MDS. Patients with AML who had elevated sCD86 levels had significantly lower complete remission (CR) rates compared with patients with AML who had normal sCD86 levels. In multivariate analysis using sCD86 as a continuous variable and including the interaction of age and sCD86 as a variable, sCD86 was a significant prognostic factor (P = 0.014) independent of cytogenetics. Further analysis demonstrated that, in patients with AML age 60 years and younger, but not in patients older than 60 years, elevated sCD86 levels were associated with significantly shorter survival (P = 0.04). There was no correlation between sCD86 levels and CR rates or survival in patients with MDS. CONCLUSIONS: The presence in patients with AML of elevated levels of circulating sCD86 were associated with lower CR rates and poor survival. The prognostic significance of sCD86 was independent of cytogenetics but was modulated by age, in that it was independently significant only in younger patients. The results suggest that sCD86 may play a role in modulating immune responses associated with the progression of AML.","['Hock, Barry D', 'McKenzie, Judith L', 'Patton, William Nigel', 'Haring, Lisa F', 'Yang, Ying', 'Shen, Yu', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Hock BD', 'McKenzie JL', 'Patton WN', 'Haring LF', 'Yang Y', 'Shen Y', 'Estey EH', 'Albitar M']","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand. barry.hock@chmeds.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2003/10/10 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11693 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Oct 15;98(8):1681-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11693.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with prostate carcinoma refractory to androgen ablation who had undergone antiandrogen withdrawal (if previously treated with an antiandrogen) were enrolled in the current study. They were treated with oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg per day on Days 1-20, prednisone 10 mg per day continuously, and DES 1 mg continuously, on a 30-day cycle. Warfarin 1 mg per day was given as prophylaxis for thrombosis. Patient levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored on a monthly basis, with imaging studies every 3 months. Patients continued to receive therapy until disease progression or the occurrence of significant toxicity. The effect of therapy on the patient's quality of life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were evaluable for response. Of the 36 patients, 15 (42%) had a 50% or greater decline in PSA levels from pretreatment levels and 1 patient (6%) with measurable disease had a partial response to therapy. The median duration of response was 4.5 months (range, 4-18 months). The overall median survival period was 16.4 months. The treatment was well tolerated, with only three patients removed from the study for toxicities associated with treatment. One patient, who had been treated for more than 24 months, developed acute leukemia. Quality of life evaluation in 17 patients showed a significant improvement in responders, whereas nonresponders had no deterioration while receiving therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and DES represent a well tolerated, low-cost combination therapy with significant activity in the treatment of patients with AIPC.","['Hellerstedt, Beth', 'Pienta, Kenneth J', 'Redman, Bruce G', 'Esper, Peg', 'Dunn, Rodney', 'Fardig, Judith', 'Olson, Karin', 'Smith, David C']","['Hellerstedt B', 'Pienta KJ', 'Redman BG', 'Esper P', 'Dunn R', 'Fardig J', 'Olson K', 'Smith DC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2003/10/10 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11686 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Oct 15;98(8):1603-10. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11686.,"['0 (Androgens)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Androgens/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Diethylstilbestrol/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['2P30 CA 46592-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

Sulforaphane belongs to a group of compounds known as isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates mainly occur in Cruciferous family. In particular, they occur in many vegetables such as broccoli and their sprouts. SFN and 2-oxohexyl isothiocyanate are potent inducers of detoxication phase 2 enzymes in mouse tissues and murine hepatoma cells in culture. Sulforaphane was shown to induce cell growth arrest in a dose dependent manner, followed by cell death. Sulforaphane induced the cell death via an apoptotic process. Two markers of apoptosis were investigated: phosphatidylserine externalization, which occurs in the early stages of apoptosis, and DNA strand breaks.

As a result, no mutations were detected in any of these cell lines examined. In addition, our analysis of two breast tumor cell lines, which had been reported to harbour ST7 mutations, provided no evidence for such mutations.

As2O3 induces complete remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The response to As2O3 is genetically determined by the t(15;17)-or the t(9;22)-specific fusion proteins PML/RARalpha or BCR/ABL. The PML portion of PML/RARalpha is crucial for the sensitivity to As2O3. PML is nearly entirely contained in PML/RARalpha. PML is upregulated by oncogenic RAS in primary fibroblasts. The aberrant kinase activity of BCR/ABL leads to constitutive activation of RAS. Therefore, we hypothesized that BCR/ABL could increase sensitivity to As2O2-induced apoptosis by modifying PML expression. To disclose the mechanism of As2O3-induced apoptosis in PML/RARalpha- and BCR/ABL-expressing cells, we focused on the role of PML for As2O3-induced cell death. Here we report that (i) sensitivity to As2O3-induced apoptosis of U937 cells can be increased either by overexpression of PML, or by conditional expression of activated RAS; (ii) also the expression of the t(8;21)-related AML-1/ETO increased sensitivity to As2O3-induced apoptosis; (iii) both BCR/ABL and AML-1/ETO activated RAS and modified the PML expression pattern; (iv) the expression of either BCR/ABL or AML-1/ETO rendered U937 cells sensitive to interferon alpha-induced apoptosis. In summary, these data suggest a crucial role of factors able to upregulate PML for As2O2-induced cell death.","['Puccetti, Elena', 'Beissert, Tim', 'Guller, Saskia', 'Li, Jun E', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Puccetti E', 'Beissert T', 'Guller S', 'Li JE', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ruthardt M']","['Med.

We measured levels of BCR-ABL transcripts in the blood of all patients in this trial who had a complete cytogenetic remission. METHODS: Levels of BCR-ABL transcripts were measured by a quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Results were expressed relative to the median level of BCR-ABL transcripts in the blood of 30 patients with untreated CML in chronic phase. RESULTS: In patients who had a complete cytogenetic remission, levels of BCR-ABL transcripts after 12 months of treatment had fallen by at least 3 log in 57 percent of those in the imatinib group and 24 percent of those in the group given interferon plus cytarabine (P=0.003). On the basis of the rates of complete cytogenetic remission of 68 percent in the imatinib group and 7 percent in the group given interferon plus cytarabine at 12 months, an estimated 39 percent of all patients treated with imatinib but only 2 percent of all those given interferon plus cytarabine had a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels of at least 3 log (P<0.001). For patients who had a complete cytogenetic remission and a reduction in transcript levels of at least 3 log at 12 months, the probability of remaining progression-free was 100 percent at 24 months, as compared with 95 percent for such patients with a reduction of less than 3 log and 85 percent for patients who were not in complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with CML who had a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels of at least 3 log by 12 months of therapy was far greater with imatinib treatment than with treatment with interferon plus cytarabine. Patients in the imatinib group with this degree of molecular response had a negligible risk of disease progression during the subsequent 12 months.","['Hughes, Tim P', 'Kaeda, Jaspal', 'Branford, Susan', 'Rudzki, Zbigniew', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hensley, Martee L', 'Gathmann, Insa', 'Bolton, Ann E', 'van Hoomissen, Iris C', 'Goldman, John M', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Hughes TP', 'Kaeda J', 'Branford S', 'Rudzki Z', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hensley ML', 'Gathmann I', 'Bolton AE', 'van Hoomissen IC', 'Goldman JM', 'Radich JP']","['Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, SA, Australia. timothy.hughes@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,2003/10/10 05:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa030513 [doi]', '349/15/1423 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2003 Oct 9;349(15):1423-32. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa030513.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,,,,,,['International Randomised Study of Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) Study Group'],,['Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society'],['N Engl J Med. 2003 Oct 9;349(15):1399-401.

LNCaP cells do express the TRPV6 gene, and Ca2+ entry currents in these cells were detected after active and passive Ca2+ store depletion by intracellular application of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, Ca2+ chelators, and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. This store-operated Ca2+ current (ISOC) had biophysical properties similar to those of the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukemia cells such as the activation mechanism, inward rectification, and Ca2+ selectivity. These properties are also shared by the Ca2+-sensing Ca2+ current (ITRPV6) recorded after heterologous expression of TRPV6 cDNA in human embryonic kidney and rat basophilic leukemia cells (Bodding, M., Wissenbach, U., Flockerzi, V. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 36656-36664). TRPV6 cDNA transfection of LNCaP cells restored recombinant ITRPV6, which can be distinguished from ISOC by the mechanism of activation, the voltage dependence of monovalent currents in the absence of external divalent cations, and the changes in Ca2+ current densities due to different membrane potentials. In addition, ISOC was not affected by antiandrogen or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment of LNCaP cells, which up-regulates TRPV6 gene expression, or by androgen treatment, which has the opposite effect. Therefore, native channels responsible for ISOC are different from those for recombinant ITRPV6 and do not appear to be affected if one of their assumed subunits, TRPV6, is up- or down-regulated, suggesting a rather rigid subunit composition in vivo.","['Bodding, Matthias', 'Fecher-Trost, Claudia', 'Flockerzi, Veit']","['Bodding M', 'Fecher-Trost C', 'Flockerzi V']","['Experimentelle und Klinische Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Medizinische Fakultat, Universitat des Saarlandes, D-66421 Homburg, Germany. matthias.boeding@uniklinik-saarland.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/10 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M308800200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75338-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 19;278(51):50872-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M308800200.

Because handling noise in microarray data presents similar challenges, we have adapted this strategy to the biclustering of discretized microarray data. RESULTS: In contrast with standard clustering that reveals genes that behave similarly over all the conditions, biclustering groups genes over only a subset of conditions for which those genes have a sharp probability distribution. We have opted for a simple probabilistic model of the biclusters because it has the key advantage of providing a transparent probabilistic interpretation of the biclusters in the form of an easily interpretable fingerprint. Furthermore, Gibbs sampling does not suffer from the problem of local minima that often characterizes Expectation-Maximization.

In patients with leukemia, this adhesion is involved in the extravascular infiltration of leukemic cells. Extravasation and tissue infiltration of malignant cells in patients with adult T-cell leukemia is mediated by the interaction of selectins and their carbohydrate ligand sialyl Lewis X, which is strongly and constitutively expressed on the leukemic cells. Constitutive expression of Lewis X in these cells is due to the transcriptional activation of Fuc-T VII, the rate-limiting enzyme in the sialyl Lewis X synthesis, induced by the Tax protein encoded by the human T-cell leukemia virus-1, the etiological virus for this leukemia. This transactivation is in clear contrast to the regulation of typical CRE-element found in various cellular genes in that it is independent of phosphorylation-dependent regulation. This must be the reason for the strong and constitutive expression of sialyl Lewis X, which exacerbates the tissue infiltration of leukemic cells. This is a good example corroborating the proposition that the abnormal expression of carbohydrate determinant at the surface of malignant cells is intimately associated with the genetic mechanism of malignant transformation of cells.","['Kannagi, R']",['Kannagi R'],"['Program of Molecular Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center, Research Institute, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. rkannagi@aichi-cc.pref.aichi.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,2003/10/10 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-1267-7_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2001;491:267-78. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-1267-7_18.,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Selectins)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Carbohydrates/*genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/genetics/metabolism', 'Selectins/*metabolism', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second part of the article outlines the work carried out in the authors' laboratory with leukaemic cell lines in an attempt to ascertain the biochemical and genetic basis of the lowering of sialyl-Le(x) expression that occurs at intermediate stages of normal haemopoietic development. Analysis of enzyme levels and mRNA expression of the fucosyl- and sialyltransferase genes has led to the conclusion that depletion of substrate resulting from high levels of enzyme activity from co-expressed genes FUT4 and ST6Gal1 probably accounts for the dip in expression of sialyl-Le(x), rather than a change in the level of expression of FUT7, the gene in myeloid cells encoding the enzyme ultimately responsible for the synthesis of sialyl-Le(x). The possible significance of this change in relation to normal cell maturation is discussed.","['Watkins, W M', 'Clarke, J L']","['Watkins WM', 'Clarke JL']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London W12 ONN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,2003/10/10 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/10 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-1267-7_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2001;491:231-65. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-1267-7_17.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fucose/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Glycolipids/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of the serine protease neutrophil elastase, localized to the granules of neutrophils and monocytes, implies an unexpected role for proteolytic regulation of hematopoiesis.

Combining chemotherapy and gene therapy appears to be a promising approach; however, the effects of chemotherapy on transgene expression in leukemic cells have not yet been investigated. METHODS: DA1-3b leukemic cells were transfected with pCDNA3 plasmids carrying GM-CSF or LacZ cDNA. The leukemic K562 cell line and primary cultured AML cells were transduced with an Ad5.CMV-LacZ adenoviral vector. Cells were then incubated with various concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and expression of the transgene was measured. Murine DA1-3b-pCDNA3/LacZ leukemic cells were also injected into syngeneic C3H/Hej mice. RESULTS: In the cells carrying pCDNA3, DNR and Ara-C dramatically increased expression of the LacZ and GM-CSF transgenes. Over-expression depended on drug dose and was due to increased transcription. Enhancement was also observed in K562 cells and in some primary cultured AML samples transduced with the Ad5.CMV-LacZ adenovirus. Addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited the over-expression, suggesting that reactive oxygen species were involved in activating the CMV promoter. In the A549 lung carcinoma cell line transduced with Ad5.CMV-LacZ, Ara-C had only a minor effect, and DNR had a detrimental effect, suggesting that expression depends on cell type. In vivo experiments in which mice received DA1-3b-pCDNA3/LacZ leukemic cells, and were then treated with Ara-C, also showed increased transgene expression in these leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: In leukemic cells, chemotherapeutic agents can induce over-expression of transgenes. This suggests a promising combined strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Vereecque, Rodolphe', 'Saudemont, Aurore', 'Depil, Stephane', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Vereecque R', 'Saudemont A', 'Depil S', 'Quesnel B']","['Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Medecine Predictive et de Recherche Therapeutique, Lille (IFR-114), France.', 'Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Medecine Predictive et de Recherche Therapeutique, Lille (IFR-114), France.', 'Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Medecine Predictive et de Recherche Therapeutique, Lille (IFR-114), France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire, Lille, France.', 'Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Medecine Predictive et de Recherche Therapeutique, Lille (IFR-114), France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.413 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2003 Oct;5(10):852-859. doi: 10.1002/jgm.413.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,10.1002/jgm.413 [doi],,,,

However, its exact mechanism of action is still not well understood. The present study investigated the mechanism of Se-MSC on the induction of apoptosis using U937 human leukemia cells. Se-MSC induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis of U937 cells as assessed by flow cytometry analysis, DNA fragmentation, and proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Se-MSC increased time- and dose-dependent cytochrome c accumulation in the cytosol, which was greatly inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2, suggesting that the apoptotic effect by Se-MSC in U937 cells is mitochondrial-dependent. Se-MSC also induced activation of caspases, followed by proteolytic cleavage of PKC-delta. The Se-MSC-induced apoptosis required activities of caspases since pretreatment of a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk greatly suppressed the Se-MSC-induced apoptosis as well as proteolytic cleavage of PKC-delta, suggesting activation of caspases is critical for the Se-MSC-induced apoptosis, and caspases lie upstream of PKC-delta. The Se-MSC-induced apoptosis of U937 cells also required activity of PKC-delta because pretreatment of rottlerin, a specific PKC-delta inhibitor greatly blocked the Se-MSC-induced apoptosis as well as processing and activities of caspases, suggesting activation of PKC-delta is also important for the Se-MSC-induced apoptosis of U937 cells, and PKC-delta lies upstream of caspases. Together, our data suggest the apoptotic mechanism by Se-MSC in U937 cells may be related to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, and mutual activation between caspases and PKC-delta via a positive feedback mechanism, which may potentiate the apoptotic action by Se-MSC in U937 cells.","['Jang, Byeong-Churl', 'Choi, Eun-Seok', 'Im, Ki-Jo', 'Baek, Won-Ki', 'Kwon, Taek Kyu', 'Suh, Min-Ho', 'Kim, Sang-Pyo', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Suh, Seong-Il']","['Jang BC', 'Choi ES', 'Im KJ', 'Baek WK', 'Kwon TK', 'Suh MH', 'Kim SP', 'Park JW', 'Suh SI']","['Chronic Disease Research Center and Institute for Medical Science, School of Medicine Keimyung University, Daegu 700-712, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 Nov;12(5):733-9.,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0CH9049VIS (Selenocysteine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'E29LP3ZMUH (rottlerin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'TWK220499Z (selenomethylselenocysteine)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Selenocysteine/analogs & derivatives', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of conophylline on TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB and JNK activations in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells. Conophylline inhibited both of these TNF-alpha-induced activations. It also inhibited phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaB-alpha. Moreover, a receptor binding assay using [125I]-TNF-alpha showed that this inhibitory effect was due to a decrease in the binding of TNF-alpha to the cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that conophylline induced only a small change in the affinity of the receptors but a significant change in the receptor number. FACS analysis showed that conophylline reduced the expression of CD120a/TNFR1, the high-affinity receptor for TNF-alpha, on the cell surface. On the other hand, conophylline did not affect the kinetics of internalization and degradation of TNF-alpha/receptor complexes or the half-life of TNF-alpha binding sites. These results indicate that conophylline down-regulates the expression of the TNF-alpha receptors on the cell surface.","['Gohda, Jin', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Gohda J', 'Inoue J', 'Umezawa K']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Nov;23(5):1373-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '0 (conophylline)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AP180 acts to limit vesicle size and maintain a pool of releasable synaptic vesicles during rapid recycling. In this study, we show that polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells express two AP180-related proteins: the ubiquitously expressed 62-kDa clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM, AP180-2) protein and a novel high-molecular-weight homolog that we have named AP180-3. Sequence analysis of AP180-3 expressed in MDCK cells shows high homology to AP180 from rat brain. AP180-3 contains conserved motifs found in brain-specific AP180, including the epsin NH2-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, the binding site for the alpha-subunit of AP-2, and DLL repeats. Our studies show that AP180-3 from MDCK cells forms complexes with AP-2 and clathrin and that membrane recruitment of these complexes is modulated by phosphorylation. We demonstrate by immunohistochemistry that AP180-3 is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles in MDCK cells and is also present in tubule epithelial cells from mouse kidney.

Such a 'population shift' effect has now been avoided by purification of haematopoietic stem-like cells that are positive for the cell surface marker AC133 from the bone marrow of healthy volunteers and 30 patients at various stages of MDS. Microarray analysis with the AC133+ cells from these individuals resulted in the identification of sets of genes with expression that was specific to either indolent or advanced stages of MDS. The former group of genes included that for PIASy, which catalyses protein modification with the ubiquitin-like molecule SUMO. Induction of PIASy expression in a mouse myeloid cell line induced apoptosis. A loss of PIASy expression may therefore contribute directly to the growth of MDS blasts and stage progression.","['Ueda, Masuzu', 'Ota, Jun', 'Yamashita, Yoshihiro', 'Choi, Young Lim', 'Ohki, Ruri', 'Wada, Tomoaki', 'Koinuma, Koji', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Mano, Hiroyuki']","['Ueda M', 'Ota J', 'Yamashita Y', 'Choi YL', 'Ohki R', 'Wada T', 'Koinuma K', 'Kano Y', 'Ozawa K', 'Mano H']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Kawachigun, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/10/09 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['4601 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04601.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(2):288-96. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04601.x.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (PIAS4 protein, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of Wilms' tumour gene 1 (WT1) in AML are rare and WT1 expression may be increased by other transcription factors. PAX2, PAX8 and GATA-1 are known physiological regulators of WT1. In the present study, we analysed either bone marrow or blood samples of 43 AML patients for the expression levels of WT1, PAX2, PAX8 and GATA-1 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler). Bone marrow samples of patients without haematological malignancies and stem cell preparation samples from healthy donors and lymphoma patients served as controls. PAX2 expression was found in 11 of 43 AML samples, with a clear correlation of PAX2 with WT1 expression levels observed. PAX8 expression was found in two additional samples. GATA-1 expression was detectable in 41 of 43 AML samples and also in all control samples; no significant differences between these groups were observed and no correlation of GATA-1 expression with WT1 expression levels was apparent. In conclusion, PAX2, and possibly PAX8, appears to be a candidate for the upregulation of WT1 in a proportion of AML, whereas GATA-1 expression cannot be explained as an inducer of WT1. In two-thirds of leukaemias from our series, the basis of WT1 upregulation cannot be explained by the simple upregulation of the known WT1 activators.","['Siehl, Jan M', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Heufelder, Karin', 'Snarski, Emilian', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Mailander, Volker', 'Keilholz, Ulrich']","['Siehl JM', 'Thiel E', 'Heufelder K', 'Snarski E', 'Schwartz S', 'Mailander V', 'Keilholz U']","['Medizinische Klinik III (Haematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine), Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat, Berlin, Germany. jsiehl@zedat.fu-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/10/09 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['4622 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04622.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(2):235-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04622.x.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)', '0 (PAX8 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX8 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor', 'PAX8 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis was carried out in 90%, of whom 53% had clonal chromosome aberrations. Some 24% and 31% had only numerical or structural abnormalities respectively. The remaining patients showed both types of abnormalities. Ploidy levels in decreasing order were: pseudodiploidy, 41%; hyperdiploidy, 32%; and hypodiploidy, 27%. Pseudodiploidy characterizes type M3 (70%) and hypodiploidy M6 (56%). Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities--t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16)--were found in 3.3%, 3.3% and 2.0% of all patients respectively. Prognostically intermediate and adverse aberrations were found in 39% and 44%, respectively, of those with an abnormal karyotype. Rare recurrent aberrations were found in two patients in this material. A previously described non-recurrent abnormality was found to be recurrent in one patient [der(20)t(11;20)(q13.2;p13)].

Virtually all children, however have at least one haploidentical parent who could serve as a donor. Such a donor is immediately available and the considerable costs of additional HLA typing, registry and banking expenditures that are necessary to procure an unrelated donor, could be reduced. Recent technological advances appear to have overcome the historical problems of graft rejection and severe graft versus host disease in the haploidentical setting, and in the latest studies the overall survival for children undergoing haploidentical SCT for leukaemia is now comparable with that following unrelated donor bone marrow or cord blood transplantation. Post-transplant infectious complications and leukaemia relapse remain the most important barriers yet to overcome, and new directions in the use of adoptive cellular immunity appear to be promising in this respect. Haploidentical SCT is now a viable option for those children who do not have an HLA compatible sibling or fully matched unrelated donor.

However, it was not clear whether Src family kinase Lyn is regulated by the Cbl family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. RESULTS: Aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) induces the rapid ubiquitination of Lyn in rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 cells. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor enhances the ubiquitination of Lyn. Stimulation of Fc epsilon RI results in the association of Lyn with c-Cbl and Cbl-b, both of which then become tyrosine phosphorylated. Co-transfection study shows that both c-Cbl and Cbl-b could induce the ubiquitination of activated Lyn in COS cells. Furthermore, over-expression of membrane-anchored form of c-Cbl inhibits the Fc epsilon RI-mediated degranulation and cytokine gene production in RBL-2H3 cells by the down-regulation of the kinase activity of Lyn through the enhanced ubiquitination. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Lyn is down-regulated by c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in proteasome after Fc epsilon RI stimulation in mast cells. Targeting of c-Cbl in the lipid raft results in the inhibition of Fc epsilon RI-mediated mast cell activation.","['Kyo, Shinkou', 'Sada, Kiyonao', 'Qu, Xiujuan', 'Maeno, Koichiro', 'Miah, S M Shahjahan', 'Kawauchi-Kamata, Keiko', 'Yamamura, Hirohei']","['Kyo S', 'Sada K', 'Qu X', 'Maeno K', 'Miah SM', 'Kawauchi-Kamata K', 'Yamamura H']","['Division of Proteomics, Department of Genome Sciences, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/06/26 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['679 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00679.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2003 Oct;8(10):825-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00679.x.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data suggest a loss of normal podocyte function, which is associated with a loss of the podocyte differentiation markers, Wilm's tumor (WT-1), synaptopodin, podocalyxin, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). We have previously shown that HIV-1 expression can induce these changes in HIV-1 transgenic mice. To identify which HIV-1 gene product(s) are responsible for the phenotypic changes in podocytes, we created multiple mutated HIV-1 constructs and then pseudotyped them with vesticular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) envelope to enhance the tropism of these mutant viruses. In addition to gag/pol, the mutant viruses lacked one of the following, env, nef, rev, vif, vpr, or vpu. In addition, we generated single gene expressing pseudotyped viruses to complement the scanning mutation approach of our viral parental construct. Murine podocytes were then infected with one of the viral constructs either lacking or expressing the various HIV-1 genes. We found that HIV-1 nef was necessary and sufficient for proliferation of podocytes and down-regulation of synaptopodin and CALLA. These data suggest that Nef induces many of the changes we observe in HIV transgenic model and, as a result, this now defines the pathway for exploration of host responses to HIV-1 infection.","['Sunamoto, Masaaki', 'Husain, Mohammad', 'He, John Cijiang', 'Schwartz, Elissa J', 'Klotman, Paul E']","['Sunamoto M', 'Husain M', 'He JC', 'Schwartz EJ', 'Klotman PE']","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)49520-1 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00283.x [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2003 Nov;64(5):1695-701. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00283.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (SYNPO protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Synpo protein, mouse)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (podocalyxin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['AIDS-Associated Nephropathy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Products, nef/*genetics/*metabolism', '*HIV-1', 'Kidney Glomerulus/pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics', 'Neprilysin/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",['IPO1 DK56249/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research in this area has the potential to contribute to our understanding of many diseases and raises several potential therapeutic opportunities. Given this potential and the speed with which our understanding of this field has advanced over recent years, it is timely to introduce the clinician to the background on which the clinical implications of this research will be built. This review begins with contrasting apoptosis with the other mechanism of cell death, necrosis, and then outlines the features by which apoptosis may be recognised. With a view to understanding the level at which this process may be involved in disease and therapeutics, it is important to be aware of the basic mechanistic features of the induction and execution of apoptosis. In this, surface molecules such as CD95 (Fas) and the cascade of intracellular enzymes involved at many levels in apoptosis, the caspases, are of central importance. In all this, the mitochondrion is crucial to the induction of apoptosis and the regulation of the whole process. In the last part of this review, we attempt to draw out the clinical relevance of all this information. It is clear that apoptosis has an important role in the pathophysiology of malignancy, particularly with respect to haematological cancers, but also other oncological diseases. Apoptosis is also very important in autoimmune disease and viral infection. Finally, it is clear that apoptosis may be manipulated therapeutically to the benefit of patients in various scenarios. This is clearly an exciting area for future development, but one which clearly depends on a thorough mechanistic understanding.","['Alenzi, Faris Q', 'Warrens, Anthony N']","['Alenzi FQ', 'Warrens AN']","['Clinical Laboratory Science, School of Medicine and Medical Sciences, King Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,2003/10/09 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/10/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03040450 [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2003 Sep 15;115(15-16):563-74. doi: 10.1007/BF03040450.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Calorimetry', 'Caspases/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forecasting', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Research', 'Rituximab', 'Spectrophotometry', 'fas Receptor']",,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a 28-year-old female with AML FAB M0, preceding DI and cytogenetic abnormalities (monosomy 7 and inversion of chromosome 9). Complete remission was achieved with FLAG after she was refractory to two different induction regimens. Prolonged neutropenia resulted in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor was performed using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. Desmopressin substitution for DI was withdrawn after transplant without recurrence of symptoms. Initial antifungal treatment, including liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and itraconazole, was replaced by voriconazole after deterioration of pulmonary aspergillosis, resulting in improvement, stabilisation and finally, also as the combined effect of discontinuation of the immunosuppressive therapy, in disappearance of signs and symptoms. Thirteen months after transplant, the patient is in continuous complete remission. The presented case study thus demonstrates that high-risk AML with concomitant invasive fungal infection may be safely and effectively treated by nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation and long-term administration of voriconazole.","['Eibl, M', 'Auner, H W', 'Zinke-Cerwenka, W', 'Sill, H', 'Dornbusch, H J', 'Linkesch, W']","['Eibl M', 'Auner HW', 'Zinke-Cerwenka W', 'Sill H', 'Dornbusch HJ', 'Linkesch W']","['Division of Hematology-Department of Internal Medicine, Karl-Franzens-University, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria. margiteibl@gmx.net']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0782-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Feb;83(2):133-6. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0782-2.

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical data, sonographic patterns, and prognosis of nodular splenic infiltration in patients with MPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 20-year period, nodular splenic lesions were found in 10 out of 183 patients with MPD. Retrospectively, splenic size, echomorphology of the lesions, clinical data, sonographic follow-up, and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: In 9 out of 10 patients the lesions were hyperechoic--in one patient hypoechoic. In 3 patients the lesions were solitary. Seven patients had multiple nodular lesions. Low platelet count was seen in 8 patients; blast crisis was seen in 7 patients. The mean survival time was 2.9 months after detection of the splenic lesions. In one patient, autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of myelosarcoma of the spleen. CONCLUSION: The appearance of nodular splenic lesions in MPD is associated with blast crisis and a short survival. Definite histologic or cytologic findings associated with splenic nodules in MPD have not been identified yet. Myelosarcoma of the spleen is the most probable diagnosis suggested.","['Gorg, Christian', 'Riera-Knorrenschild, Jordi', 'Gorg, Konrad', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard']","['Gorg C', 'Riera-Knorrenschild J', 'Gorg K', 'Zugmaier G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Philipps University, Baldingerstrasse, 35043 Marburg/Lahn, Germany. goergc@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/02/20 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0753-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Jan;83(1):14-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0753-7.

In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study we determined the effect of administration of PEG-rHuMGDF prior to CT and of administration prior, concurrent, and 1 day post CT on platelet recovery and transfusion requirements in patients receiving consolidation CT for de novo AML. Patients were randomized to receive either 30 microk/kg PEG-rHuMGDF as a single dose on day -6 ( n=37), placebo as a single dose on day -6 ( n=9), 30 microk/kg PEG-rHuMGDF administered on day -6 followed by 10 microg/kg on days -5 to day 6 (through CT and including the day after CT, n=35), or placebo administered on day -6 to day 6 ( n=9). The median times to transfusion-independent platelet recovery to >20x10(9)/l were 24.5 and 24.0 days in the PEG-rHuMGDF day -6 group and PEG-rHuMGDF day -6 to 6, respectively, compared to 21.0 days in the placebo group. There were no significant differences in the number of days of platelet transfusions between either PEG-rHuMGDF schedule or placebo. The PEG-rHuMGDF day -6 to 6 group had a delayed absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery compared to either placebo or PEG-rHuMGDF day -6 treated patients. Thus, alteration of the scheduling of PEG-rHuMGDF in terms of earlier dosing before and during chemotherapy did not improve platelet recovery but rather delayed hematopoietic reconstitution.

Only the major and the complete cytogenetic response groups differed significantly (p<0.001) in the BCR-ABL expression from that of patients at diagnosis. Among the different cytogenetic response groups the only significant difference (p<0.01) in the BCRABL expression was obtained between the major and the minor responders.

However, few data are available regarding the association between in vitro antifungal susceptibility and outcome of candidemia in this patient population. We therefore evaluated the association of in vitro antifungal susceptibility and other risk factors with failure of initial antifungal therapy in cancer patients with candidemia. Candidemia cases in cancer patients from 1998 to 2001 (n = 144) were analyzed retrospectively along with their in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole (National Committee for Clinical and Laboratory Standards M27-A method). Patients were evaluable for outcome analysis if they received continuous unchanged therapy with either fluconazole or amphotericin B for >/=5 days. We excluded cases of mixed candidemia. In vitro susceptibility testing data of the first Candida bloodstream isolate were analyzed. Appropriate therapy was defined as that using an active in vitro antifungal for >/=5 days. For fluconazole susceptible-dose dependent Candida species, we defined appropriate therapy as a fluconazole dose of >/=600 mg/day. The Candida species distribution was 30% Candida albicans, 24% Candida glabrata, 23% Candida parapsilosis, 10% Candida krusei, 9% Candida tropicalis, and 3% other. Overall, amphotericin B was the most active agent in vitro, with only 3% of the isolates exhibiting resistance to it (>1 mg/L). Dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole was seen in 13% and 21% of the isolates, respectively, while resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was seen in 13% and 26%, respectively.Eighty patients were evaluable for outcome analysis. In multivariate analysis, the following factors emerged as independent predictors of failure of initial antifungal therapy: leukemia (p = 0.01), bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.006), and intensive care unit stay at onset of infection (p = 0.02). Inappropriate antifungal therapy, as defined by daily dose and in vitro susceptibility, was not shown consistently to be a significant factor (it was significant in multivariate analysis, p = 0.04, but not in univariate analysis), indicating the complexity of the variables that influence the response to antifungal treatment in cancer patients with candidemia.","['Antoniadou, Anastasia', 'Torres, Harrys A', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Thornby, John', 'Bodey, Gerald P', 'Tarrand, Jeffrey P', 'Han, Xiang-Yang', 'Rolston, Kenneth V I', 'Safdar, Amar', 'Raad, Issam I', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Antoniadou A', 'Torres HA', 'Lewis RE', 'Thornby J', 'Bodey GP', 'Tarrand JP', 'Han XY', 'Rolston KV', 'Safdar A', 'Raad II', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, Unit 402, The University of Texas M.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transporter proteins that contribute to drug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the MDR1 gene, is an ABC transporter normally involved in the excretion of toxins from cells. It also confers resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents. P-gp is overexpressed at baseline in chemotherapy-resistant tumors, such as colon and kidney cancers, and is upregulated after disease progression following chemotherapy in malignancies such as leukemia and breast cancer. Other transporter proteins mediating drug resistance include those in the multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP) family, notably MRP1, and ABCG2. These transporters are also involved in normal physiologic functions. The expressions of MRP family members and ABCG2 have not been well worked out in cancer. Increased drug accumulation and drug resistance reversal with P-gp inhibitors have been well documented in vitro, but only suggested in clinical trials. Limitations in the design of early resistance reversal trials contributed to disappointing results. Despite this, three randomized trials have shown statistically significant benefits with the use of a P-gp inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy. Improved diagnostic techniques aimed at the selection of patients with tumors that express P-gp should result in more successful outcomes. Further optimism is warranted with the advent of potent, nontoxic inhibitors and new treatment strategies, including the combination of new targeted therapies with therapies aimed at the prevention of drug resistance.","['Leonard, Gregory D', 'Fojo, Tito', 'Bates, Susan E']","['Leonard GD', 'Fojo T', 'Bates SE']","['Cancer Therapeutics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.8-5-411 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2003;8(5):411-24. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.8-5-411.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism']",,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,

This nonclassical MHC molecule is associated with various carcinomas in humans. To understand the biological consequences of MICA expression in the gut, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice (T3(b)-MICA Tg) under the control of the T3(b) promoter. The T3(b)-MICA Tg mice expressed MICA selectively in the intestine and had an increased number of TCRalphabeta CD4CD8alphaalpha, double-positive (DP) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the small bowel. These MICA-expanded DP IELs exhibited a bias to Vbeta8.2 and overlapped motifs of the complementarity-determining region 3 region among various Tg mice.

We cloned the coding region of a retinoic acid-induced gene from a human thymus library, which was the mRNA encoding the 666-amino acid human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76. We have designated it RARP1 (retinoic acid response proline-rich protein 1). Transcription of an approximately 2.4-kbp mRNA occurred mainly in organs with immune functions, such as thymus, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes. Cycloheximide blocked the ATRA-induced expression. In megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia HEL cells, the amount of RARP1 mRNA was high, but it was low in human T-lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells. A specific antibody against RARP1 recognized a 110-kDa protein, which accumulates after incubation of HL-60 cells with ATRA. In immunohistochemical experiments, strong RARP1 staining was observed in the megakaryocytes of bone marrow and spleen, and heterogeneous stain was seen in thymus. Transcriptional studies showed that RARP1 expression impaired the transactivation through activator protein1 and serum response-element in all cell lines we checked, whereas it did not affect the transactivation through cAMP-response element in the same cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that proline-rich regions of RARP1 are the functional regions regulated for suppression of activator protein1 transactivation. These data suggest that ATRA-inducible RARP1 selectively affects signal transduction and may contribute to myeloid and megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Inagaki, Takeshi', 'Suzuki, Satoru', 'Miyamoto, Takahide', 'Takeda, Teiji', 'Yamashita, Koh', 'Komatsu, Ai', 'Yamauchi, Keishi', 'Hashizume, Kiyoshi']","['Inagaki T', 'Suzuki S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Takeda T', 'Yamashita K', 'Komatsu A', 'Yamauchi K', 'Hashizume K']","['Department of Aging Medicine and Geriatrics, Institute on Aging and Adaptation, Division of Medicine, Shinshu University Graduate School, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto 390-8621, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M308016200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75435-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 19;278(51):51685-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M308016200.

Tax, a 40-kDa protein, regulates viral and cellular transcription, host signal transduction, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Tax has been shown to modulate cellular CREB and NFkappaB pathways; however, to date, its role in binding to various host cellular proteins involved in tumorigenesis has not been fully described. In this study, we describe the Tax-associated proteins and their functions in cells using several approaches. Tax eluted from a sizing column mostly at an apparent molecular mass of 1800 kDa. Following Tax immunoprecipitation, washes with high salt buffer, two-dimensional gel separation, and mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 32 proteins was identified. Many of these proteins belong to the signal transduction and cytoskeleton pathways and transcription/chromatin remodeling. A few of these proteins, including TXBP151, have been shown previously to bind to Tax. The interaction of Tax with small GTPase-cytoskeleton proteins, such as ras GAP1m, Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and gelsolin, indicates how Tax may regulate migration, invasion, and adhesion in T-cell cancers. Finally, the physical and functional association of Tax with the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex was assessed using in vitro chromatin remodeling assays, chromatin remodeling factor BRG1 mutant cells, and RNA interference experiments. Collectively, Tax is able to bind and regulate many cellular proteins that regulate transcription and cytoskeletal related pathways, which might explain the pleiotropic effects of Tax leading to T-cell transformation and leukemia in HTLV-1-infected patients.","['Wu, Kaili', 'Bottazzi, Maria Elena', 'de la Fuente, Cynthia', 'Deng, Longwen', 'Gitlin, Scott D', 'Maddukuri, Anil', 'Dadgar, Shabnam', 'Li, Hong', 'Vertes, Akos', 'Pumfery, Anne', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['Wu K', 'Bottazzi ME', 'de la Fuente C', 'Deng L', 'Gitlin SD', 'Maddukuri A', 'Dadgar S', 'Li H', 'Vertes A', 'Pumfery A', 'Kashanchi F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M310069200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52840-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jan 2;279(1):495-508. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M310069200.

FA patients' cells are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), exposure to which results in cytogenetic aberrations and cell death. To date Moloney murine leukemia virus vectors have been used in clinical gene therapy. Recently, third-generation lentiviral vectors based on the HIV-1 genome have been developed for efficient gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells. We generated a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing the FA group A cDNA driven by the murine stem cell virus U3 LTR promoter and used the vector to transduce side-population (SP) cells isolated from bone marrow of Fanconi anemia group A (Fanca) knockout mice. One thousand transduced SP cells reconstituted the bone marrow of sublethally irradiated Fanca recipient mice. Phenotype correction was demonstrated by stable hematopoiesis following MMC challenge. Using real-time PCR, one proviral vector DNA copy per cell was detected in all lineage-committed cells in the peripheral blood of both primary and secondary recipients. Our results suggest that the lentiviral vector transduces stem cells capable of self-renewal and long-term hematopoiesis in vivo and is potentially useful for clinical gene therapy of FA hematopoietic cells.","['Yamada, Kaoru', 'Ramezani, Ali', 'Hawley, Robert G', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Arwert, Fre', 'Arnold, Larry W', 'Walsh, Christopher E']","['Yamada K', 'Ramezani A', 'Hawley RG', 'Ebell W', 'Arwert F', 'Arnold LW', 'Walsh CE']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(03)00223-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00223-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Oct;8(4):600-10. doi: 10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00223-5.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fanca protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fanconi Anemia/*drug therapy', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Lentivirus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['R01 HL 67388/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL65519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both mercaptopurine and thioguanine are substrates for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and are converted into the ribonucleotides 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) respectively. The accumulation of these monophosphates inhibits several vital metabolic reactions. Today, these thiopurine bases remain valuable agents for the induction and maintenance of remissions in patients with myelocytic and acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Considerable efforts have been made to prepare other novel mercaptopurine and thioguanine analogs and their nucleosides to improve the antitumor efficacy. The effectiveness of these thiopurines against certain tumor cell lines suggested that some of these mercaptopurine analogs and their nucleosides would be worthy of consideration in order to determine whether they exert a more selective effect against neoplastic cells than against normal cells or they might be useful in patients whose disease has become resistant to 6MP or 6TG.

AMT was soon superseded by its 10-methyl congener, methotrexate (MTX), based on toxicity considerations; MTX remains, with one limited exception, the only antifolate anticancer agent in clinical use to this date. Because of the safety and utility of MTX, considerable effort has been invested in attempting to design more therapeutically selective antifolates or antifolates with a wider tumor spectrum. Initially, the design was based on the burgeoning knowledge of folate-dependent pathways and the determinants of the mechanism of action of MTX. These determinants include transport, the tight-binding inhibition of its target (the folate-dependent enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)), and metabolism of MTX to poly-gamma-glutamate (Glu(n)) metabolites. These early studies led to the development of other antifolate DHFR inhibitors of two types: (1). ""classical"" analogs that use the same cellular transport systems as MTX and are also metabolized to Glu(n); and (2). ""nonclassical"" (i.e., lipophilic) analogs that do not require transport systems and that are not metabolized to Glu(n). Although several of these analogs have undergone clinical trial, none is proved superior to MTX. Detailed examination of the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and selectivity of MTX showed that inhibition of both dTMP synthesis and de novo purine synthesis, secondary to DHFR inhibition, led to DNA synthesis inhibition and subsequent cell death; inhibition of other folate-dependent pathways did not appear necessary for cell death. Further studies showed that the contribution of inhibition of dTMP or purine synthesis to cell death varied in different cell types. These data suggested that inhibition of one of these pathways individually might (at least in some cases) be therapeutically superior to the dual inhibition induced by MTX. Thus in rational design and in structure-based design studies, two new classes of antifolate enzyme inhibitors were elaborated-direct inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TMPS) and direct inhibitors of one or both of the two folate-dependent enzymes of de novo purine synthesis. Members of each class included both classical and nonclassical types. After preclinical evaluation, several of these have moved into clinical trials. To date only one new TMPS inhibitor has successfully completed clinical trials and been approved for routine use; this drug, Tomudex (D1694, raltitrexed) is currently approved only in Europe and only for the treatment of colon cancer. This still represents a step forward for antifolates, however, since MTX is well-known to be ineffective in colon cancer; thus Tomudex extends the tumor range of antifolates. Antifolate development continues. Based on the immense body of knowledge now extant on antifolates, specific aspects of the mechanism of action have been the focus. Newer antifolates have been described that inhibit more than one pathway in folate metabolism, that have improved delivery, or that inhibit other targets in folate metabolism. These new analogs are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development.","['McGuire, John J']",['McGuire JJ'],"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

Therefore, the inhibition of kinases has been proposed to be a promising strategy in the context of anti-cancer treatment. Many other kinases have been selected as drug discovery targets based on the prevalence of mutations, over-expression and unscheduled activation in human cancer. Of the various protein kinases chosen, Src family kinases are amongst the most extensively studied kinase oncogenes in academia and industry. This review focuses on our current understanding of the deregulation and role of Src family kinases in human cancer and leukemia. Recent data implicate the action of c-Src in cancer metastasis, mediated by up-regulation of various protease systems (calpain, uPA) as well as disruption of E-cadherin signalling. Moreover, novel roles of various Src family members in the development of human leukemia have been found. New insights into downstream signalling mechanisms, including the activation of STAT3, PDK1 and Akt, further corroborate the importance of Src family kinases in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Despite our rather clear understanding of Src family kinases as pro-oncogenes no Src family kinase inhibitor has entered a clinical trial so far.

Rigorously planned and executed clinical trials, incorporating measurement of appropriate biomarkers and pharmocodynamic endpoints are critical for selecting the optimal dose and schedule. A detailed understanding of the molecular mode of action of Hsp90 inhibitors alongside the elucidation of the molecular pathology of individual cancers will help us to identify tumour types and individual patients that will benefit most from treatment. Careful in vitro and in vivo experiments are needed to choose the most potentially advantageous combination studies. It is important to construct a pharmacologic audit trail linking molecular biomarkers and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters to tumour response endpoints. Phase I clinical studies with 17AAG have shown that the drug can be given at does that are well tolerated and that also achieve active pharmacokinetic exposures and elicit molecular signatures of gene and protein expression that are indicative of Hsp90 inhibition. Furthermore, examples of disease stabilisation have been documented, consistent with the generally cytostatic responses that are seen in animal models. Selecting tumour types for Phase II clinical trials must involve balancing 1) our knowledge of molecular response determinants, such as the expression of and dependence upon key client proteins and 2) more pragmatic evidence of antitumour activity in the relevant preclinical models. Examples of likely disease targets include chronic myeloid leukaemia, melanoma, breast, ovarian, brain, thyroid, colorectal and prostate cancer.","['Banerji, Udai', 'Judson, Ian', 'Workman, Paul']","['Banerji U', 'Judson I', 'Workman P']","['Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, UK. paul.workman@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,2003/10/08 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009033481813 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2003 Oct;3(5):385-90. doi: 10.2174/1568009033481813.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we performed experiments on the effects of MbetaCD on exocytotic membrane fusion and mobilization of Ca(2+) and on the localization of the tyrosine kinase Lyn. Inhibition of degranulation by MbetaCD was observed even under stimulation with the phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. Therefore, MbetaCD affected a process downstream of Ca(2+) influx, or membrane fusion between the granule and the plasma membrane. Intracellular calcium measurements revealed that MbetaCD inhibited the Ca(2+) increase induced by antigen. Furthermore, we found that MbetaCD significantly inhibited Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular medium through the store-operated calcium channel (SOC) but did not affect Ca(2+) release from the intracellular Ca(2+) store. Fluorescent image analysis of cells expressing Lyn-YFP showed that treatment with MbetaCD scarcely affected the localization and lateral mobility of Lyn in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that cholesterol depletion by MbetaCD decreases degranulation mainly by inhibiting the SOC and membrane fusion between the secretory granules and the plasma membrane in mast cells.","['Kato, Naoto', 'Nakanishi, Mamoru', 'Hirashima, Naohide']","['Kato N', 'Nakanishi M', 'Hirashima N']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Tanabe-dori, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya 467-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,2003/10/08 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/10/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi034758h [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Oct 14;42(40):11808-14. doi: 10.1021/bi034758h.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', '*beta-Cyclodextrins', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapidly increasing body of knowledge provides evidence also for multiple epigenetic alterations in these disorders, which can complement or even precede genetic aberrations. Gene inactivation ('silencing') of tumor suppressor and growth inhibitory genes (e.g. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16, p15, p21) is frequently mediated by DNA methylation of gene promoters. The acetylation state of histones (functionally linked to the DNA methylation state by the methylcytosine binding protein 2, recruiting histone deacetylases) provides a second major epigenetic silencing mechanism. Therapeutic reversal strategies are being developed for acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and malignant lymphomas. Since the discovery of the DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) inhibitory activity of two azanucleosides (5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine/decitabine) even at doses with minimal nonhematologic toxicity, both have been clinically studied in several myeloid neoplasias, particularly in elderly patients unable to tolerate aggressive treatment. Further development of agents counteracting aberrant methylation is directed at more targeted approaches, for example, antisense molecules against Dnmts. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can be inhibited by numerous compounds (sodium phenylbutyrate, valproic acid, novel compounds such as depsipeptide), which have entered the clinical arena in similar indications as Dnmt inhibitors. Impressive effects of HDAC inhibition in acute promyelocytic leukemia models (PML/RARA expression) translate the finding of HDAC recruitment by this chimeric transcription factor to its target genes. The recent discovery of recruitment by PML/RARA also of Dnmt activity to the retinoic acid receptor-beta promoter makes it an interesting candidate for Dnmt inhibitors. Studies combining a 're-expressor' strategy with inhibitors of Dnmts and HDACs are underway. Thus, resensitization to biological agents such as retinoids, colony-stimulating factors and other differentiation inducers may be envisioned.","['Claus, Rainer', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Claus R', 'Lubbert M']","['Department Internal Medicine I, Division Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Hugstetter Str., D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2003/10/07 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206814 [doi]', '1206814 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Sep 29;22(42):6489-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206814.,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['DNA Methylation', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that Ad5 has evolved a unique strategy that leads to the sustained neutralization of PML bodies throughout infection, thereby ensuring optimal viral proliferation.","['Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel', 'Puvion-Dutilleul, Francine', 'Lutz, Pierre', 'Dreyer, Dominique', 'de The, Hugues', 'Chatton, Bruno', 'Kedinger, Claude']","['Rosa-Calatrava M', 'Puvion-Dutilleul F', 'Lutz P', 'Dreyer D', 'de The H', 'Chatton B', 'Kedinger C']","['Transgene S.A., Rue de Molsheim, 67000 Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,2003/10/07 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2003/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.embor.embor943 [doi]', 'embor943 [pii]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2003 Oct;4(10):969-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.embor.embor943.,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (hexon capsid protein, Adenovirus)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Adenoviridae Infections', 'Capsid Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Virus Replication']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1326401,,,

METHODS: Among 1,832 patients entered on Children's Cancer Group's chemotherapy trials with acute myeloid leukemia, 199 patients had EML, defined as any leukemic collection outside the bone marrow cavity. Three patient groups were denoted: group 1 (n=109) with EML involving skin (with or without other sites of EML), group 2 (n=90) with EML in sites other than skin, and group 3 (n=1,633) without EML. RESULTS: The incidence of EML was 10.9%. Group 1 patients tended to be younger, had higher white blood cell counts, were more often CNS positive, had FAB M4 or M5 subtypes, and possessed more abnormalities of chromosome 11 than group 3 patients. Group 2 patients were younger, more often had the FAB M2 subtype, and had a higher incidence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) abnormality than group 3, but had similar white blood cell counts and incidence of CNS positivity at diagnosis. For group 1 the 5-year event-free survival was 26%, significantly worse than for group 3 at 29%. Event-free survival was better for group 2 patients (5-year estimate 46%), which remained a favorable prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. The authors retrospectively determined whether 118 (59%) of the EML patients received localized radiotherapy to the site of EML: 42 did and 76 did not. There were no differences in estimated event-free survival between patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Non-skin (group 2) EML appeared to be an independent favorable prognostic factor. Localized radiotherapy to the site of EML at the end of induction chemotherapy did not improve outcome.","['Dusenbery, Kathryn E', 'Howells, William B', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Lee, Jae Won', 'Kobrinsky, Nathan', 'Barnard, Dorothy R', 'Wells, Robert J', 'Buckley, Jonathan D', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Woods, William G']","['Dusenbery KE', 'Howells WB', 'Arthur DC', 'Alonzo T', 'Lee JW', 'Kobrinsky N', 'Barnard DR', 'Wells RJ', 'Buckley JD', 'Lange BJ', 'Woods WG']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA. dusen001@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,2003/10/07 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200310000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Oct;25(10):760-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200310000-00004.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/genetics/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PLZF gene becomes fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene as a result of the t(11, 17)(q23;q21) chromosomal translocation that is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. We now show that endogenous PLZF in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells is modified by conjugation with SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier-1) and that PLZF colocalizes with SUMO-1 in the nucleus of transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Site-directed mutagenesis identified lysine 242 in the RD2 domain of human PLZF as the sumoylation site. A luciferase reporter gene assay suggested that SUMO-1 modification of this residue is required for transcriptional repression by PLZF, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that this modification increases the DNA binding activity of PLZF. PLZF-mediated regulation of the cell cycle and transcriptional repression of the cyclin A2 gene were also dependent on sumoylation of PLZF on lysine 242. These results demonstrate that PLZF is modified by SUMO-1 conjugation and that this modification regulates the biological functions of PLZF.","['Kang, Soo Im', 'Chang, Woo-Jung', 'Cho, Ssang-Goo', 'Kim, Ick Young']","['Kang SI', 'Chang WJ', 'Cho SG', 'Kim IY']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/07 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309237200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75410-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 19;278(51):51479-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309237200.

Strikingly, we find that the shared binding site on gp130 has an entirely rigid core, while the LIF binding interface diverges sharply in structure and chemistry from that of other gp130 ligands. Dissection of the LIF-gp130 interface, along with comparative studies of other gp130 cytokines, reveal that gp130 has evolved a ""thermodynamic plasticity"" that is relatively insensitive to ligand structure, to enable crossreactivity.

METHODS: Wild-type PML was transfected into bladder cancer cells (5637 cell) and expressed in a replication-deficient adenovirus-mediated gene delivery system and introduced into human bladder cancer cells (5637 cell) in vitro and in vivo. The effect and mechanisms of the PML gene in cell growth, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells were studied using in vitro and in vivo growth assays, soft agar colony-forming assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay and in vivo tumorigenicity assay. RESULTS: Overexpression of PML in 5637 cells significantly reduced their growth rate and clonogenicity on soft agar. PML suppressed bladder cancer cell growth by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Adenovirus-mediated PML (Ad-PML) significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity and growth of bladder cancer cells. Intratumoral injection of Ad-PML into tumors induced by 5637 cells dramatically suppressed their growth.

METHODS: Fifty-one American patients (34 men and 17 women) were included in this study. Of them there were 41 patients with pro-B cell type ALL, 9 with B cell type ALL and 1 with T cell type ALL. Chromosome metaphases of each sample were prepared according to standard protocols. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using commercially available DNA probes, including whole chromosome painting probes, locus specific probes, specific chromosome centromere probes and dual color/multiple color translocation fusion probes. The digital image analysis was carried out using Cytovision and Quips FISH programs. RESULTS: An overall incidence of chromosomal anomalies, including t (9;22), MLL gene rearrangements, t (12;21), and numerical chromosomal anomalies of chromosomes 4, 10, 17 and 21 was found in 33 patients (65%). Thirty-one of them were pediatric patients and two adults. The t (12;21) was the commonest chromosomal anomaly detected in this population; 14 out of the 45 pediatric patients (31%) were positive for TEL/AML1 fusion, among which three had an additional derivative 21 [t (12;21)], four had a deletion of 12p and two had an extra copy of chromosome 21. All 14 patients with positive TEL/AML1 fusion had ALL pre-B cell or B-cell lineage according to standard immunotyping. The percentage of cells with fusion signals ranged from 20% to 80%. All fourteen patients positive for TEL/AML1 gene fusion were mosaic. Three out of the 14 patients positive for the TEL/AML1 gene fusion were originally reported to be culture failures and none of the remaining eleven samples had been found to have chromosome 12 abnormalities by conventional cytogenetic techniques. All pediatric patients with pre-T or T cell lineage and the six adults were negative for TEL/AML1 fusion. One patient had double Philadelphia chromosomes, three had a rearrangement or a deletion of the MLL gene, one had t (4;11) and two had a deletion of the MLL. One of the patients with an MLL deletion also had a large ring of chromosome 21, and r (21) was caused by AML1 gene tandemly duplicated at least five times. The second case with the MLL deletion was also unique, the patient had a t (12;21) as well. A total of 20 patients had numerical changes (gain or loss) of chromosomes 4, 10, 17 and 21. Eight patients were found to have trisomies of three or four different chromosomes. Interestingly, seven of these patients did not have TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL or the MLL gene rearrangement; one did have the TEL/AML1 gene fusion. Eleven patients with pro-B cell or B cell type ALL (9 children with ALL, 2 adults with ALL) had numerical changes of chromosome 21 (gain 1 or 2 chromosome 21), among them, 10 patients had no structural alteration of chromosome 21, and one was combined by t (12; 21). Four patients had a monosomy of chromosome 17 and three out of these patients with monosomy 17 also had a fusion signal of TEL/AML1. CONCLUSIONS: FISH plays an important role in detecting chromosome changes, especially in some cryptic chromosome translocations and patients with culture failures.

These dose estimates include in utero doses to the embryo and fetus and doses delivered postnatally to the newborn child from radionuclides retained at birth. This paper considers the effect on doses of the time of radionuclide intake and examines the proportion of dose delivered in utero and postnatally for different radionuclides. Methods used to calculate doses to the fetal skeleton are compared. For many radionuclides, doses are greatest for intakes early in pregnancy but important exceptions, for which doses are greatest for intakes later in pregnancy, are iodine isotopes and isotopes of the alkaline earth elements, including strontium. While radionuclides such as 131I deliver dose largely in utero, even for intakes late in pregnancy, others such as 239Pu deliver dose largely postnatally, even for intakes early during pregnancy. For alpha emitters deposited in the skeleton, the assumption made is of uniform distribution of the radionuclide and of target cells for leukaemia and bone cancer in utero; that is, the developing bone structure is not considered. However, for beta emitters, the bone structure was considered. Both approaches can be regarded as reasonably conservative, given uncertainties in particular in the location of the target cells and the rapid growth and remodelling of the skeleton at this stage of development.","['Phipps, A W', 'Harrison, J D', 'Fell, T P', 'Eckerman, K F', 'Nosske, D']","['Phipps AW', 'Harrison JD', 'Fell TP', 'Eckerman KF', 'Nosske D']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon, OX11 0RQ, UK. alan.phipps@nrpb.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,2003/10/07 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a006240 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2003;105(1-4):279-84. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a006240.,['0 (Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Bone and Bones/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Fetus/*metabolism', 'Gestational Age', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'International Cooperation', '*Maternal Exposure', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioisotopes/classification/*pharmacokinetics', 'Radiometry/*methods/standards', 'Societies, Scientific']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Over a period of 20 years (January 1982-December 2001), 13 diagnosed and/or suspected cases of LPD of the breast on FNAC were retrieved and reviewed from the files of the Cytology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. For each case, both May-Grunwald-Giemsa- and Papanicolaou-stained smears were reviewed along with hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections and immunohistochemistry, when available. RESULTS: Of the 13 cases, 1 aspirate was from a male breast and the rest were from female. Only 12 cases with documented histology were included in the study. Five of the 12 cases were diagnosed on FNAC as high grade lymphoma, 2 as low grade lymphoma, 2 as poorly differentiated malignant tumor/lymphoma, and 1 each as Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) deposit and immature lymphoid cells, ?leukemia/lymphoma deposit. The tumors manifested mostly as an unilateral mass (10 cases), with 2 cases presenting with bilateral breast lumps. The lymph nodes were involved in 8 cases. Histologically, 2 of the 12 cases were poorly differentiated malignant tumors. Of the remaining 10 cases, 8 were documented as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 1 each as Hodgkin's lymphoma, mixed cellularity and AML. CONCLUSION: FNAC is an inexpensive but highly useful diagnostic tool to distinguish between primary lymphoma and carcinoma of the breast. This helps with clinical management in avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures.","['Singh, N Gopendro', 'Kapila, Kusum', 'Dawar, Ramesh', 'Verma, Kusum']","['Singh NG', 'Kapila K', 'Dawar R', 'Verma K']","['Cytology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,2003/10/07 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/10/07 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000326598 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2003 Sep-Oct;47(5):739-43. doi: 10.1159/000326598.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Carcinoma/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/*pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to HNE, PR3 is the target of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) in Wegener's granulomatosis. The mechanisms leading to the membrane expression of PR3 and HNE are still unclear and appear to be critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ANCA. Stably transfected rat basophilic cell lines (RBL) with PR3 or HNE were used to analyze the PR3 and HNE secretion mechanisms and differentiate between them. RBL cells were lacking endogenous PR3 and HNE. They were stably transfected with HNE or PR3 or an inactive mutant of PR3 (PR3S203A). Using the calcium ionophore A23187 as a secretagogue, higher serine proteinase activity was secreted in the supernatant of RBL/HNE than in RBL/PR3. It is interesting that PR3 and PR3/S203A were also expressed at the plasma membrane, thus demonstrating that serine protease activity was not required for plasma membrane expression. In contrast, no expression of plasma membrane HNE could be detected in RBL/HNE. Apoptosis induced by etoposide was evaluated by DNA fragmentation, the presence of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, and annexin V labeling. No membrane HNE was detected in RBL/HNE. In contrast, in RBL/PR3 and in RBL/PR3S203A, the membrane expression of PR3 and PR3S203A increased with etoposide concentrations and appeared closely related to annexin V labeling. Our data suggest that membrane PR3 originates from two distinct pools, the granular pool mobilized following degranulation or a plasma membrane pool mobilized upon apoptosis.","['Durant, Stephanie', 'Pederzoli, Magali', 'Lepelletier, Yves', 'Canteloup, Sandrine', 'Nusbaum, Patrick', 'Lesavre, Philippe', 'Witko-Sarsat, Veronique']","['Durant S', 'Pederzoli M', 'Lepelletier Y', 'Canteloup S', 'Nusbaum P', 'Lesavre P', 'Witko-Sarsat V']","['Inserm U507, Hopital Necker, 161, rue de Sevres, 75015 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.0203079 [doi]', 'jlb.0203079 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Jan;75(1):87-98. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0203079.

Embryo exposure to environmental estrogens has been proposed as one of the possible underlying causes. In mice, genetic, immunological, and experimental evidence suggest that germ cell testicular tumors may derive from primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of gametes. Here we show that relatively high concentrations of estrogens stimulate mouse PGC growth in vitro through the somatic cells of the gonadal ridges. Moreover, we found that estrogens stimulate the transcription of the Steel gene and the production of c-Kit ligand in gonadal somatic cells, and that this growth factor is likely to be responsible for the observed stimulation of PGC growth via an Akt/PTEN pathway. Finally, we show that estrogen stimulation of gonadal somatic cells in culture, in combination with PTEN down-regulation in PGCs and the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor in the culture medium, result in high frequency of PGC transformation in tumorigenic cells. Based on these results, we present a novel experimental in vitro model for tumorigenic germ cell transformation and identify molecular pathways likely involved in development of germ cell tumors after estrogen exposure.","['Moe-Behrens, Gerd H G', 'Klinger, Francesca Gioia', 'Eskild, Winnie', 'Grotmol, Tom', 'Haugen, Trine B', 'De Felici, Massimo']","['Moe-Behrens GH', 'Klinger FG', 'Eskild W', 'Grotmol T', 'Haugen TB', 'De Felici M']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Andrology Laboratory, Rikshospitalet, University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/me.2003-0006 [doi]', 'me.2003-0006 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2003 Dec;17(12):2630-8. doi: 10.1210/me.2003-0006.

We investigated BL22, an immunotoxin composed of the Fv portion of an anti-CD22 antibody fused to a 38-kDa Pseudomonas exotoxin-A fragment. B cells from 22 patients with CLL were immunomagnetically enriched (96% purity) and were cultured with BL22 or an immunotoxin that does not recognize hematopoietic cells. The antileukemic activity of BL22 was correlated with CD22 expression, as determined by flow cytometry. BL22 induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and membrane flipping. Cell death was associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and X-chromosomal inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Furthermore, BL22 induced a proapoptotic 18-kDa Bax protein and conformational changes of Bax. Z-VAD.fmk abrogated apoptosis, confirming that cell death was executed by caspases. Conversely, interleukin-4, a survival factor, inhibited spontaneous death in culture but failed to prevent immunotoxin-induced apoptosis. BL22 cytotoxicity was markedly enhanced when combined with anticancer drugs including vincristine. We also investigated HA22, a newly engineered immunotoxin, in which BL22 residues are mutated to improve target binding. HA22 was more active than BL22. In conclusion, these immunotoxins induce caspase-mediated apoptosis involving mitochondrial damage. Combination with chemotherapy is expected to improve the efficacy of immunotoxin treatment.","['Decker, Thomas', 'Oelsner, Madlene', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Salvatore, Giuliana', 'Wang, Qing-cheng', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Licht, Thomas']","['Decker T', 'Oelsner M', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Salvatore G', 'Wang QC', 'Pastan I', 'Peschel C', 'Licht T']","['III Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. t.decker@lrz.tu-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-04-1317 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43884-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Apr 1;103(7):2718-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-04-1317.

We have recently shown that ligation of CD44, a cell surface molecule present on AML cells, with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) inhibits their proliferation. However, its mechanism has not been investigated yet. Here, using the NB4 cell line as a model of proliferating human AML cells, and the A3D8 mAb to ligate CD44, we show for the first time that CD44 ligation stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) protein, resulting in increased association with cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes and inhibition of their kinase activity. Moreover, using a p27 antisense vector, we provide direct evidence that p27 is the main mediator of cell growth arrest by CD44. CD44 ligation also leads to p27 accumulation in THP-1, KG1a, and HL60 cell lines and in primary leukemic cells, suggesting that this process is general in AML. Taken together, our present results suggest that CD44 is a new and efficient means to increase the expression of p27 in AML cells. Considering that elevated expression of p27 is a factor of good prognosis in AML, these results provide a new basis for developing CD44-targeted therapy in AML.","['Gadhoum, Zeineb', 'Leibovitch, Marie-Pierre', 'Qi, Junyuan', 'Dumenil, Dominique', 'Durand, Laetitia', 'Leibovitch, Serge', 'Smadja-Joffe, Florence']","['Gadhoum Z', 'Leibovitch MP', 'Qi J', 'Dumenil D', 'Durand L', 'Leibovitch S', 'Smadja-Joffe F']","[""Inserm EMI 00-03, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, 10, avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-04-1218 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50246-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 1;103(3):1059-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-04-1218.

CML patients frequently respond to treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), even though the mechanisms of the response remain unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the role of IFN-alpha in differentiation and activity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from CML patients as well as in modulation of the cell response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment of CML monocytes with IFN-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resulted in the rapid generation of activated DCs (CML-IFN-DCs) expressing interleukin-15 (IL-15) and the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene. These cells were fully competent to induce IFN-gamma production by cocultured autologous T lymphocytes and expansion of CD8(+) T cells. LPS treatment of CML-IFN-DCs, but not of immature DCs generated in the presence of IL-4/GM-CSF, induced the generation of CD8(+) T cells reactive against autologous leukemic CD34(+) cells. Altogether, these results suggest that (1) the generation of highly active monocyte-derived DCs could be important for the induction of an antitumor response in IFN-treated CML patients and (2) IFN-alpha can represent a valuable cytokine for the rapid generation of active monocyte-derived DCs to be utilized for vaccination strategies of CML patients.","['Gabriele, Lucia', 'Borghi, Paola', 'Rozera, Carmela', 'Sestili, Paola', 'Andreotti, Mauro', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Foa, Robert', 'Belardelli, Filippo']","['Gabriele L', 'Borghi P', 'Rozera C', 'Sestili P', 'Andreotti M', 'Guarini A', 'Montefusco E', 'Foa R', 'Belardelli F']","['Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Laboratory of Virology, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-03-0981 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50234-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 1;103(3):980-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0981.

When the cell lines were studied alone, we found that these chromosomal abnormalities were associated with the predominant variation in transcriptional programs across the set of cell lines studied. When cell lines and clinical samples were studied together, we found that each chromosomal abnormality (TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, or MLL abnormalities) was associated with a characteristic gene expression signature that was shared by both cell lines and clinical samples. However, BCR/ABL was associated with a much more heterogeneous pattern of expression than were TEL/AML1 and MLL abnormalities. This observation has important implications for the study of BCR/ABL ALL. In addition, we systematically identified genes whose expression was associated with TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, or MLL abnormalities in both clinical samples and cell lines. Although some of these genes have previously been described, many have not previously been reported to be associated with one of these chromosomal abnormalities.

Although some viral products can influence the expression and action of cellular genes, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Here we show that the AIR-1-encoded human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) strongly inhibits viral replication, but not virus entry, in human B- and T-cell susceptible targets. This effect results from CIITA inhibiting the Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-2 long-term repeat. Further molecular analysis shows that the N-terminal region of CIITA encompassing the first 321 amino acids is responsible for the inhibitory effect on viral replication. This region is crucial for the transactivation of human MHC class II genes and includes the activation domain as well as domains interacting with coactivators that also are used by the viral transactivator Tax to modulate cellular functions. These results represent the first evidence that a cellular transcriptional activator, controlling the coordinate expression of the entire family of MHC class II antigen-presenting molecules, inhibits HTLV-2 viral replication by a distinct mechanism. In this new role CIITA may represent a new tool for therapeutic strategies aimed at counteracting HTLV-2 replication and spreading.","['Casoli, Claudio', 'De Lerma Barbaro, Andrea', 'Pilotti, Elisabetta', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Tosi, Giovanna', 'Accolla, Roberto S']","['Casoli C', 'De Lerma Barbaro A', 'Pilotti E', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Tosi G', 'Accolla RS']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Nephrology, and Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Parma; Via Gramsci 14, 43100 Parma, Italy. claudio.casoli@unipr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2503 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50236-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 1;103(3):995-1001. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2503.

An oral formulation of fludarabine has recently become available in the majority of European countries for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell CLL after initial treatment with an alkylating agent-based regimen. It is the first oral formulation of a purine analogue available for clinical use in B-cell CLL. Pharmacokinetic studies evaluating the bioavailability of oral fludarabine indicate that an oral dose of 40 mg/m2/day would provide similar systemic drug exposure to the standard intravenous dose of 25 mg/m2/day. A phase II study evaluated the clinical efficacy of six to eight cycles of oral fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day for 5 days of each 28-day cycle in 78 patients with previously treated B-cell CLL. Depending on the criteria used, the overall response rate was 46.2% (20.5% complete response [CR], 25.6% partial response [PR]) or 51.3% (17.9% CR, 33.3% PR). These results were similar to the 48% overall response rate reported in a similar historical control group treated with intravenous fludarabine. Myelosuppression (WHO grade 3 or 4) was the most frequently reported adverse effect with oral fludarabine therapy. Other common adverse effects included infection and gastrointestinal disturbances, although these were usually of mild to moderate severity (WHO grade 1 or 2). Overall, the tolerability profile of oral fludarabine is similar to that of the intravenous formulation.","['Plosker, Greg L', 'Figgitt, David P']","['Plosker GL', 'Figgitt DP']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,2003/10/04 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/10/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['63214 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200363210-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2003;63(21):2317-23. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200363210-00004.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",,,27,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2003;63(21):2324.

METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of all patients treated at their institution from January 1990 to August 1999 for culture-proven pulmonary aspergillus infection. RESULTS: Among the 43 patients studied, the median age at the time of diagnosis of IPA was 13.1 years. The most common primary diagnoses were acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 18) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 14); 27 patients (63%) had received a bone marrow transplant (BMT). Of the 18 patients who underwent surgical intervention for IPA, 14 (78%) had one operation, whereas the remaining 4 patients had 2. The 4 patients alive at the time this report was written had undergone surgical intervention 2, 10, 23, and 44 months previously respectively. Surgical resection of the involved lung parenchyma was significantly prognostic for survival (P <.001). Other factors that influenced outcome were the extent of pulmonary invasion, steroid use, and the timing of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in regard to the diagnosis of IPA. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality rate of children treated for malignancies and immunodeficiency syndromes in who IPA develops remains high, and antifungal therapy alone may not be curative. Surgical resection may provide a small but possibly the only chance for survival. Therefore, we would advocate for resection of all involved tissue, even if it requires reoperation.","['Gow, Kenneth W', 'Hayes-Jordan, Andrea A', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Shenep, Jerry L', 'Hoffer, Frederic A', 'Davidoff, Andrew M', 'Rao, Bhaskar N', 'Schropp, Kurt P', 'Shochat, Stephen J']","['Gow KW', 'Hayes-Jordan AA', 'Billups CA', 'Shenep JL', 'Hoffer FA', 'Davidoff AM', 'Rao BN', 'Schropp KP', 'Shochat SJ']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,2003/10/03 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346803003956 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(03)00395-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2003 Sep;38(9):1354-60. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(03)00395-6.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of an international working group.,509-19,"Neonatal tumours occur every 12,500-27,500 live births and comprise 2% of childhood malignancies, but there is little clarity as to their real prevalence, sites of origin and pathological nature as reported series vary. As an entity, neonatal tumours provide a unique window of opportunity to study tumours in which minimal environmental interference has occurred. The majority of tumours present with a mass at birth (e.g., teratomas, neuroblastomas, mesoblastic nephroma, fibromatosis), which are not infrequently identified on antenatal ultrasound. Histologically, teratoma and neuroblastoma remain the two main tumour types encountered with soft tissue sarcoma, renal tumours, CNS tumours and leukaemia being the next most common tumour types identified. Malignant tumours are uncommon in the neonatal period per se and benign tumours may have malignant potential. A particular problem exists in clinical classification, as histological features of malignancy do not always correlate with clinical behaviour. Benign tumours may also be life threatening because of their size and location. Other tumours may demonstrate local invasiveness, but no metastatic potential, and tumours that are clearly malignant may demonstrate unpredictable or uncertain behaviour. Screening programmes have brought more tumours to light, but do not appear to affect the overall prognosis. They may provide clues to the stage at which tumours develop in foetu. The aetiology of cancer in children is multifactorial and includes both genetic and environmental factors. The association between congenital abnormalities and tumours is well established (15% of neonatal tumours). Genetic defects are highly likely in neonatal tumours and include those with a high risk of malignancy (e.g., retinoblastoma), but also genetically determined syndromes with an increased risk of malignancy and complex genetic rearrangements. Tumours are mostly genetically related at a cellular level and factors influencing cellular maturation or apoptosis within the developing foetus may continue to operate in the neonatal period. Cytogenetics of neonatal neoplasms appear to differ from neoplasms in older children, thus possibly explaining some of the observed differences in clinical behaviour. Certain constitutional chromosome anomalies, however, specifically favour tumours occurring in the foetal and neonatal period. In support of this hypothesis, certain cytogenetic anomalies appear to be specific to neonates, and a number of examples are explored. Other environmental associations include ionizing radiation, drugs taken during pregnancy, infections, tumours in the mother and environmental exposure.","['Moore, S W', 'Satge, D', 'Sasco, A J', 'Zimmermann, A', 'Plaschkes, J']","['Moore SW', 'Satge D', 'Sasco AJ', 'Zimmermann A', 'Plaschkes J']","['Department of Paediatric Surgery, University of Stellenbosch, P.O.

The causes of this cytogenetic pattern remain largely unknown. An unusual type of chromosomal abnormality coined as segmental chromosomal aberration (SCA) has been recurrently observed in HL cell lines and was suggested to be associated with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) rearrangements. Moreover, centrosome abnormalities provoking deficient chromosome segregation have been reported in many solid tumors and also in cHL cell lines. Whether SCA, rDNA rearrangements or centrosome abnormalities also occur in primary cHL is not yet known. Thus, we performed extensive molecular cytogenetic and immunohistological studies in two cHL cases. Both cases presented SCA associated with genomic gains of the REL and JAK2 loci, respectively. The SCA involving JAK2 was associated with rDNA rearrangements. The absolute centrosome size of HRS cells in both cases was significantly larger than in non-HRS cells, but the relative centrosome size of HRS cells corrected for nuclear size was in the same range as that of the non-neoplastic cells. These findings demonstrate that the various mechanisms associated with chromosomal instability warrant a more detailed characterization in cHL.","['Martin-Subero, J I', 'Knippschild, U', 'Harder, L', 'Barth, T F E', 'Riemke, J', 'Grohmann, S', 'Gesk, S', 'Hoppner, J', 'Moller, P', 'Parwaresch, R M', 'Siebert, R']","['Martin-Subero JI', 'Knippschild U', 'Harder L', 'Barth TF', 'Riemke J', 'Grohmann S', 'Gesk S', 'Hoppner J', 'Moller P', 'Parwaresch RM', 'Siebert R']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/10/03 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403129 [doi]', '2403129 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Nov;17(11):2214-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403129.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Centrosome/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*classification', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the EBV-derived latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) mediates lymphotoxin production by inducing NF-kappaB binding to the lymphotoxin promoter. We assessed lymphotoxin production, LMP1 expression, and NF-kappaB activation in Z-43 (EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cells), Daudi (EBV-positive Burkitt's cells), and 3A4 (EBV-negative Burkitt's cells containing a stably transfected tetracycline-inducible LMP1 construct). Z-43 cells expressed high levels of LMP1 (immunoblot) and lymphotoxin (ELISA); the EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma line Daudi expressed neither LMP1 nor lymphotoxin. Similarly, induction of LMP1 in the 3A4 cells (exposed to tetracycline) was accompanied by a 13-fold increase in lymphotoxin levels (ELISA) as compared to uninduced (LMP1-negative) cells. EMSAs demonstrated high levels of NF-kappaB activation in Z-43 and tetracycline-induced 3A4 cells, but much lower levels in the uninduced 3A4 cells.

Previously, we reported that nitric oxide (NO), produced by an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), spontaneously expressed by the B-CLL cells, contributed to their deficiency in apoptosis. In the present work, we show that ex vivo treatment of leukemic cells from B-CLL patients with flavopiridol results in the inhibition of iNOS expression, as determined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting, and in a marked inhibition of NO production measured in situ with a specific fluorescent probe (DAF-2 DA). These effects are accompanied by membrane, mitochondrial and nuclear events of apoptosis. Flavopiridol exposure also results in the stimulation of caspase 3 activity and in caspase-dependent cleavage of p27(kip1), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is overexpressed in B-CLL. Thus, flavopiridol is capable of downregulating both iNOS and p27(kip1) expression in B-CLL cells. Furthermore, flavopiridol-promoted apoptosis is partly reverted by an NO donor, suggesting that inhibition of the NO pathway could participate in the apoptotic effects of flavopiridol on the leukemic cells.","['Billard, C', 'Kern, C', 'Tang, R', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, F', 'Kolb, J-P']","['Billard C', 'Kern C', 'Tang R', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Kolb JP']","['U 365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/10/03 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403139 [doi]', '2403139 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2435-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403139.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2004 Feb;18(2):243-6.

Although the roles of hypoxia in solid tumors have been widely studied, few studies were reported regarding the possible effects of hypoxia on leukemic cells. Here, we showed for the first time that low concentrations of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), a hypoxia-mimicking agent, and 2-3% O(2) triggered differentiation of various subtypes of human acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines, including NB4, U937 and Kasumi-1 cells, respectively, from M3, M5 and M2b-type AML, but CoCl(2) did not modulate AML subtype-specific fusion proteins promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) and AML1-ETO. Treatment with CoCl(2) also induced primary leukemic cells from some AML patients to undergo differentiation. Similar to what occurs in solid tumor cells, CoCl(2)-mimicked hypoxia also increased the level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity in leukemic cells. The CoCl(2) induction of HIF-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity were inhibited by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, which also blocked CoCl(2)-induced cell differentiation in leukemic cells. These results provide an insight into a possible link of hypoxia or HIF-1alpha and leukemic cell differentiation, and are possibly of significance to explore clinical potentials of hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking agents and novel target-based drugs for differentiation therapy of leukemia.","['Huang, Y', 'Du, K-M', 'Xue, Z-H', 'Yan, H', 'Li, D', 'Liu, W', 'Chen, Z', 'Zhao, Q', 'Tong, J-H', 'Zhu, Y-S', 'Chen, G-Q']","['Huang Y', 'Du KM', 'Xue ZH', 'Yan H', 'Li D', 'Liu W', 'Chen Z', 'Zhao Q', 'Tong JH', 'Zhu YS', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology of Basic Medical College, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/10/03 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403141 [doi]', '2403141 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Nov;17(11):2065-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403141.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '5O5U71P6VQ (linsidomine)', 'D46583G77X (Molsidomine)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Cobalt/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Molsidomine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether centrosome aberrations occur in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and correlate with histologic subtype, karyotype, and other biological disease features, we examined 24 follicular lymphomas (FL), 18 diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas (DLCL), 33 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), and 17 extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCL), using antibodies to centrosomal proteins. All 92 NHL displayed numerical and structural centrosome aberrations as compared to nonmalignant lymphoid tissue. Centrosome abnormalities were detectable in 32.3% of the cells in NHL, but in only 5.5% of lymphoid cells from 30 control individuals (P<0.0001). Indolent FL and MZBCL contained only 25.8 and 28.8% cells with abnormal centrosomes. In contrast, aggressive DLCL and MCL harbored centrosome aberrations in 41.8 and 35.0% of the cells, respectively (P<0.0001). Centrosomal aberrations correlated to lymphoma grade, mitotic, and proliferation indices, but not to the p53 labeling index. Importantly, diploid MCL contained 31.2% cells with abnormal centrosomes, while tetraploid samples harbored centrosome aberrations in 55.6% of the cells (P<0.0001). These results indicate that centrosome defects are common in NHL and suggest that they may contribute to the acquisition of chromosomal instability typically seen in NHL.","['Kramer, A', 'Schweizer, S', 'Neben, K', 'Giesecke, C', 'Kalla, J', 'Katzenberger, T', 'Benner, A', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Ho, A D', 'Ott, G']","['Kramer A', 'Schweizer S', 'Neben K', 'Giesecke C', 'Kalla J', 'Katzenberger T', 'Benner A', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Ho AD', 'Ott G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/10/03 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403142 [doi]', '2403142 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Nov;17(11):2207-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403142.,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Cell Division', 'Centrosome/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Diploidy', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Mitotic Index', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Polyploidy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a significant increase in leukemia cell apoptosis ex vivo was detected in CD34(+) cells, while no such increase was observed in the CD34(-) subpopulation, suggesting that CD34(+) leukemia cells are the main targets for apoptosis induction through antileukemic treatment. No alterations in Bax and Bcl-2 expression were found during in vivo chemotherapy, and CD95 expression and sensitivity remained low, indicating the induction of apoptosis independent of the CD95 system or regulation of protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2.

Significant ZAP-70 mRNA levels exceeding those found in control samples with 5% T cells were detected in 36% of the CLL cases. Patients in the ZAP-70 positive cohort were characterized by an unfavorable clinical course with a significantly shorter progression-free survival as compared to the ZAP-70-negative patients (64%).

The response was sequentially monitored by cytogenetics from bone marrow metaphases (n=803) and qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR from peripheral blood samples (n=1117). Complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was achieved in 60 (imatinib, 87%) vs 10 patients (IFN/Ara-C, 14%) after a median observation time of 24 months. Within the first year after CCR, best median ratio BCR-ABL/ABL was 0.087%, (imatinib, n=48) vs 0.27% (IFN/Ara-C, n=9, P=0.025). BCR-ABL was undetectable in 25 cases by real-time PCR, but in only four patients by nested PCR. Median best response in patients with relapse after CCR was 0.24% (n=3) as compared to 0.029% in patients with continuous remission (n=52, P=0.029). We conclude that (i) treatment with imatinib in newly diagnosed CML patients is associated with a rapid decrease of BCR-ABL transcript levels; (ii) nested PCR may reveal residual BCR-ABL transcripts in samples that are negative by real-time PCR; (iii) BCR-ABL transcript levels parallel cytogenetic response, and (iv) imatinib is superior to IFN/Ara-C in terms of the speed and degree of molecular responses, but residual disease is rarely eliminated.","['Muller, M C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Lahaye, T', 'Deininger, M W N', 'Berndt, A', 'Fruehauf, S', 'Neubauer, A', 'Fischer, T', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Schneller, F', 'Krause, S W', 'Nerl, C', 'Sayer, H G', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Waller, C', 'Aulitzky, W', 'le Coutre, P', 'Freund, M', 'Merx, K', 'Paschka, P', 'Konig, H', 'Kreil, S', 'Berger, U', 'Gschaidmeier, H', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Muller MC', 'Gattermann N', 'Lahaye T', 'Deininger MW', 'Berndt A', 'Fruehauf S', 'Neubauer A', 'Fischer T', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Schneller F', 'Krause SW', 'Nerl C', 'Sayer HG', 'Ottmann OG', 'Waller C', 'Aulitzky W', 'le Coutre P', 'Freund M', 'Merx K', 'Paschka P', 'Konig H', 'Kreil S', 'Berger U', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

The median levels for imatinib-treated patients continued to decrease and had not reached a plateau by 24 months. A total of 24 IFN+AraC-treated patients crossed over to imatinib. Once imatinib commenced, the median BCR-ABL/BCR% levels in these patients were not significantly different to those on first-line imatinib for the equivalent number of months. The incidence of progression in imatinib-treated patients, defined by hematologic, cytogenetic or quantitative PCR criteria, was significantly higher in the patients who failed to achieve a 1 log reduction by 3 months or a 2 log reduction by 6 months, P=0.002.

These latter activities are referred to here as the metabotrophic potential of neurotrophins. We recently reported that circulating NGF and BDNF levels are reduced in the metabolic syndrome and in acute coronary syndromes, and that the tissue content of NGF is reduced in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Thus we hypothesize that a metabotrophic deficit due to reduction of neurotrophin availability may be implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The metabotrophic deficit hypothesis also considers metabolism-related beneficial effects exerted by other neurotrophic factors, particularly ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins.","['Chaldakov, George N', 'Fiore, Marco', 'Hristova, Mariana G', 'Aloe, Luigi']","['Chaldakov GN', 'Fiore M', 'Hristova MG', 'Aloe L']","['Division of Cell Biology, Department of Forensic Medicine, Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria. chaldakov@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,2003/10/03 05:00,2003/12/25 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['3664 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2003 Oct;9(10):HY19-21.,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Arteriosclerosis/metabolism', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/blood', 'Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/blood', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*etiology/metabolism']",,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is overwhelming evidence in some malignancies that the tumor clone is heterogeneous with respect to proliferation and differentiation. In human leukemia, the tumor clone is organized as a hierarchy that originates from rare leukemic stem cells that possess extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and are responsible for maintaining the tumor clone. We report here the identification and purification of a cancer stem cell from human brain tumors of different phenotypes that possesses a marked capacity for proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. The increased self-renewal capacity of the brain tumor stem cell (BTSC) was highest from the most aggressive clinical samples of medulloblastoma compared with low-grade gliomas. The BTSC was exclusively isolated with the cell fraction expressing the neural stem cell surface marker CD133. These CD133+ cells could differentiate in culture into tumor cells that phenotypically resembled the tumor from the patient. The identification of a BTSC provides a powerful tool to investigate the tumorigenic process in the central nervous system and to develop therapies targeted to the BTSC.","['Singh, Sheila K', 'Clarke, Ian D', 'Terasaki, Mizuhiko', 'Bonn, Victoria E', 'Hawkins, Cynthia', 'Squire, Jeremy', 'Dirks, Peter B']","['Singh SK', 'Clarke ID', 'Terasaki M', 'Bonn VE', 'Hawkins C', 'Squire J', 'Dirks PB']","['The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2003/10/03 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 15;63(18):5821-8.,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD', 'Astrocytoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infratentorial Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments with specific inhibitors indicated the phosphorylation is downstream of Bcr-Abl kinase and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These results suggest that Bcr-Abl may regulate translation of critical targets in CML cells via mTOR. They also provide a rationale for testing the combination of mTOR inhibitors with the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib in patients with CML.

The efficacious induction of apoptosis was observed at 100 microM for 6h. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that rhein induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), cytochrome c release from mitochondrion to cytosol, and cleavage of Bid protein. Rhein also induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase. However, these actions seem not to be associated with the apoptosis induction because antioxidants including N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), Tiron, and catalase did not block rhein-induced apoptosis, although they could block the generation of ROS and the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 kinase.

Retrospective study of 26 cases observed at the institute Salah-Azaiz].,302-7,"PURPOSE: To collect second cancers in patients treated for Hodgkin disease (HD) during adolescence and young adulthood at Salah Azaiz Institute of Tunis. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We consider as second cancer all tumours other than HD observed in patients after treatment for HD. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients among 614 treated for HD between 1975 and 1991 developed 26 secondary tumours (4.2%). There were 17 males and eight females (sex ratio 2:1). Mean age at the diagnosis of HD was 32.5 years (12-56). HD was stage II (eight cases), stage III (14) and stage IV in three. The first treatment was combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 22 cases and only chemotherapy in three cases (stage IV). Radiotherapy was delivered with Cobalt 60 by large fields. Mean dose was 41.3 Gy (2 Gy/fraction in 21 and 3.3 in one). Chemotherapy was MOPP (13), MOPP and vinblastine (four), MOPP-ABVD (five), ABVD (two) and vinblastine only in one. Mean delay of second tumours was 114.5 months (40-276).

Receptor-interacting proteins such as corepressors and coactivators play a crucial role in specifying the overall transcriptional activity of the receptor in response to ligand treatment. Little is known however on how receptor activity is controlled by intermediary factors which interact with RARs in a ligand-independent manner. RESULTS: We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), a transcriptional corepressor, to be a RAR-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid assay. We confirmed this interaction by GST-pull down assays and show that the PLZF N-terminal zinc finger domain is necessary and sufficient for PLZF to bind RAR. The RAR ligand binding domain displayed the highest affinity for PLZF, but corepressor and coactivator binding interfaces did not contribute to PLZF recruitment. The interaction was ligand-independent and correlated to a decreased transcriptional activity of the RXR-RAR heterodimer upon overexpression of PLZF. A similar transcriptional interference could be observed with the estrogen receptor alpha and the glucocorticoid receptor. We further show that PLZF is likely to act by preventing RXR-RAR heterodimerization, both in-vitro and in intact cells. CONCLUSION: Thus RAR and PLZF interact physically and functionally. Intriguingly, these two transcription factors play a determining role in hematopoiesis and regionalization of the hindbrain and may, upon chromosomal translocation, form fusion proteins. Our observations therefore define a novel mechanism by which RARs activity may be controlled.","['Martin, Perrine J', 'Delmotte, Marie-Helene', 'Formstecher, Pierre', 'Lefebvre, Philippe']","['Martin PJ', 'Delmotte MH', 'Formstecher P', 'Lefebvre P']","['INSERM U 459 and Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de Medecine Henri Warembourg, 1 place de Verdun, 59045 Lille cedex, France. p.lefebvre@lille.inserm.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucl Recept,Nuclear receptor,101170538,2003/10/03 05:00,2003/10/03 05:01,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:01 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1478-1336-1-6 [doi]', '1478-1336-1-6 [pii]']",epublish,Nucl Recept. 2003 Sep 6;1(1):6. doi: 10.1186/1478-1336-1-6.,,,,,20030906,,,,,,,,,,PMC212040,,,

METHODS: We examined all new cases of vitiligo seen in the Dermatology Unit of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) over a 14-year period: January 1985 to December 1998. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-one patients with vitiligo, representing 3.2% of new dermatologic cases, were enrolled. The study group was made up of 153 males and 198 females, giving a sex ratio of 1 : 1.3. The peak incidence of vitiligo was in the second and third decades of life, and the most common form of presentation was the localized focal type (77%), followed by the segmental type (12.5%) and the generalized form (10.5%). Common sites affected were the limbs (32%), trunk (23.8%), face (18.2%), head and neck (9.1%), and the mucous membranes (7.4%). There was a positive family history of vitiligo in 18% of subjects and 3.4% had systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (1.7%), anemia (0.8%), hyperthyroidism (0.6%), and leukemia (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Vitiligo on darkly pigmented skin is often a very striking disease. Our findings show that the pattern of vitiligo is similar to that reported from other parts of the world.

They influence the cell cycle, apoptosis and the proliferation of different types of cell lines. The STAT5 proteins are induced in response to multiple haematopoietic cytokines. Because they are constitutively active in certain haemato-oncologic diseases, it is also suggested that they play an important role in leukaemogenesis. However, function of these proteins in haematopoietic cell transformation and proliferation is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of perturbation of STAT5 expression [using oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) against STAT5 mRNA], on the clonogenicity and survival of selected human leukaemic cell lines, HEL, HL-60, K562, TF-1. We analysed the effect of ODN pre-treatment on the cell clonogenicity in methylcellulose cultures according to the time and the temperature of exposure. Moreover, we attempted to estimate apoptosis induced in examined cells, by flow cytometry using combined Annexin V-PI staining and the TUNEL method. We also applied the RT-PCR method to analyse Bax and Bcl-xL gene expression. We found that the perturbation of STAT5 expression with antisense oligonucleotides caused a decrease in the proliferative potential of human K562 and TF-1 cell lines.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with 2 such unusual cases of pediatric B-lineage ALL. DESIGN: Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features of the leukemic blast cells were reviewed in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings. RESULTS: The leukemic blast cells in both cases were small to medium with scant basophilic cytoplasm and several small inconspicuous nucleoli, characteristic of L1 lymphoblasts. Immunophenotypically, they were positive for CD19, CD22, and low-density CD20, with expression of surface immunoglobulin lambda light chain. They were negative for immature (CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), myeloid, and T-cell-associated markers. Conventional cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies failed to demonstrate chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc gene. Both patients were treated with Children's Cancer Group ALL protocols and had good responses. CONCLUSIONS: B-lineage ALL with a mature phenotype, L1 morphology, and absent chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc gene is best classified and managed as precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma instead of Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma.","['Li, Shiyong', 'Lew, Glen']","['Li S', 'Lew G']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Ga, USA. sli2@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,2003/10/03 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['OA3051 [pii]', '10.5858/2003-127-1340-IBALLW [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2003 Oct;127(10):1340-4. doi: 10.5858/2003-127-1340-IBALLW.,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of these findings, future study should include the identification of risk factors in environmental and genetic stresses.

The response to glivec was assessed by achievement of a complete hematological remission and the cytogenetic effect (the degree of reduction of cell clone Ph+ in bone marrow). Tolerance and safety of the drug was studied by monthly standard clinicohematological tests. RESULTS: Not only a hematological remission (92.4%), but also partial (46.8%) or complete (27.8%) elimination of BCR-ABL +/- cells were achieved after 12 months of the treatment. Glivec was well tolerated. Hematological toxicity primarily as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 54.4 and 42% patients, respectively. Neutropenia of the third degree which made impossible to continue the treatment was observed in 29.1% patients; throbocytopenia of the third degree was registered in 16.5% patients. Among most frequent non-hematological side effects there were moderate edema, nausea, leg muscle convulsions, weight gain, arthralgias, skin eruption. All the complications were transient, were managed in all cases with only a short-time discontinuation of glivec therapy. CONCLUSION: High activity of glivec at early stages of CML allows using this drug as a first-line therapy in patients with CML.","['Turkina, A G', 'Khoroshko, N D', 'Druzhkova, G A', 'Zingerman, B V', 'Zakharova, E S', 'Chelysheva, E Iu', 'Vinogradova, O Iu', 'Domracheva, E V', 'Zakharova, A V', 'Kovaleva, L G']","['Turkina AG', 'Khoroshko ND', 'Druzhkova GA', 'Zingerman BV', 'Zakharova ES', 'Chelysheva EIu', 'Vinogradova OIu', 'Domracheva EV', 'Zakharova AV', 'Kovaleva LG']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,2003/10/03 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2003/10/03 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2003;75(8):62-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,Effektivnost' terapii imatiniba mezilatom (glivekom) v khronicheskoi faze mieloleikoza.,,,,,,,

Tax transfection resulted in enhanced expression of p21 protein in T and fibroblastoid cells. Similarly, Tax-expressing cells have higher amounts of endogenous p21 protein and RNA. However, neither Tax-negative, HTLV-1 transformed cells or HTLV-1-negative T cell lines had detectable levels of p21 protein and RNA. Cotransfection of Tax strongly activated the p21 promoter. CREB/ATF defective Tax mutant (M47) activated the p21 promoter significantly less efficiently. Tax activated wild type (wt) p21 promoter in p53-negative Jurkat and p53-positive A301cells, irrespective of endogenous p53 status, and activated a mutant p21 promoter containing a p53 responsive element (p53RE) deletion as strongly as wt promoter. Of importance, cdk2 activity was almost completely abolished in Tax-induced p21-expressing MT-2 cells, suggesting that Tax-induced p21 predominantly affects the activity of cdk2, a late G1 and S phase kinase. Taken together, these findings suggest that HTLV-1 Tax activates p21/Waf1/Cip1, a cell growth inhibitor, in a p53-independent mechanism through CREB/ATF-related transcription factors, and inhibits cdk2. Tax induction of p21 may balance the T-cell proliferation function of Tax and may contribute to the long clinical latency of HTLV-1 infection and the delayed development of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Chowdhury, Iqbal H', 'Farhadi, Arash', 'Wang, Xiao-Fan', 'Robb, Merlin L', 'Birx, Deborah L', 'Kim, Jerome H']","['Chowdhury IH', 'Farhadi A', 'Wang XF', 'Robb ML', 'Birx DL', 'Kim JH']","['Department of Vaccine Development and Research, Henry M.

Although fathers of children with LNHL were more likely to have been radiation workers, the risk was most marked in those with doses below the level of detection. The timing of paternal employment as a radiation worker has now been examined. The previously reported elevated risk of LNHL in the children of male radiation workers was limited to those whose fathers were still radiation workers at conception or whose employment also continued until diagnosis. Children whose fathers stopped radiation work prior to their conception were found to have no excess risk of LNHL. It was not possible to distinguish between the risks associated with paternal radiation work at conception and at the time of diagnosis. A reanalysis of the original study hypothesis incorporating updated dosimetric information gave similar results to those obtained previously. In particular, the risks of LNHL did not show an association with radiation doses received by the father before conception. It seems likely that the increased risk of LNHL among the children of male radiation workers is associated with an increased exposure to some infective agent consequent on high levels of population mixing.","['Sorahan, T', 'Haylock, R G E', 'Muirhead, C R', 'Bunch, K J', 'Kinlen, L J', 'Little, M P', 'Draper, G J', 'Kendall, G M', 'Lancashire, R J', 'English, M A']","['Sorahan T', 'Haylock RG', 'Muirhead CR', 'Bunch KJ', 'Kinlen LJ', 'Little MP', 'Draper GJ', 'Kendall GM', 'Lancashire RJ', 'English MA']","['Institute of Occupational Health, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,2003/10/02 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6601273 [doi]', '6601273 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Oct 6;89(7):1215-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601273.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Radiometry', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2394296,,,

While TRM is most likely due to heavy pretreatment, AML relapse after BMT may be due to resistant disease or to a poor graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect of the transplant. The degree of GvL may depend on individual donor/recipient immunoreactivity. In most published cases of second allogeneic BMT, both transplants were performed from the same donor. Here, we describe a patient who was first transplanted for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (AML FAB M3v) from his HLA-identical brother and received intensive immunotherapy including donor lymphocytes and IL2. He remained free from GvHD >I degrees, but developed CNS relapse. After a second BMT from another HLA-identical brother, he spontaneously developed GvHD III degrees, and has now been disease free for nearly 3 years. In this patient, long-term remission of AML relapsing after BMT was achieved by combining remission induction using an individual chemotherapy protocol with a second BMT from an alternative matched related donor and transient GvHD III degrees, which probably conferred a GVL effect.","['Classen, C F', 'Debatin, K-M', 'Friedrich, W', 'Schulz, A S']","['Classen CF', 'Debatin KM', 'Friedrich W', 'Schulz AS']","[""University Children's Hospital Ulm, D-89070 Ulm, Germany. carl.classen@medizin.uni-ulm.de""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,2003/10/02 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704225 [doi]', '1704225 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Oct;32(8):843-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704225.,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen cell lines, representing 11 human cancers, one human transformed kidney cell line, and one murine leukemia cell line, were treated with 5 microM polyamide-fluorescein conjugates for 10-14 h, then imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A conjugate containing a beta-alanine residue at the C terminus of the polyamide moiety showed no nuclear localization, whereas an analogous compound lacking the beta-alanine residue was strongly localized in the nuclei of all cell lines tested. The localization profiles of several other conjugates suggest that pyrrole-imidazole sequence and content, dye choice and position, linker composition, and molecular weight are determinants of nuclear localization.

To test the hypothesis that CLA ameliorates viral disease, we developed a viral challenge model by infecting pigs with type-2 porcine circovirus (PCV2). After 42 d of dietary supplementation with either soybean oil (n = 16) or CLA (n = 16), half of the pigs in each group were challenged with PCV2. We examined the effect of CLA on the development of lesions (i.e., lymphoid depletion and pneumonia) and observed the kinetics of the immune responses against PCV2. The viral infection depleted immature B cells (IgM+SWC3+) and favored proapoptotic mRNA expression profiles [i.e., suppressed B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-xl (Bcl-xl) and stimulated Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak)] in the external inguinal lymph nodes. B-cell depletion was more accentuated in pigs fed the control diet, whereas interleukin (IL)-2 mRNA expression was downregulated. Histopathological examination of the lungs revealed that the interstitial pneumonia tended to be more severe in infected pigs fed the control diet, which were also affected by growth retardation. CD8+ T cells were the primary cellular targets of CLA action in peripheral blood (CD8+CD29low and CD8+CD45RC+) and thymus (CD8+ and CD4+CD8+). CLA interacted with PCV2 to increase the proliferation of CD8+ T cells and to suppress PCV2-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production in CD4+ T cells. At the molecular level, these cellular immunoregulatory properties were associated with differential patterns of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (alpha and gamma) mRNA expression between diets in virally infected pigs.","['Bassaganya-Riera, Josep', 'Pogranichniy, Roman M', 'Jobgen, Scott C', 'Halbur, Pat G', 'Yoon, Kyoung-Jin', ""O'Shea, Marianne"", 'Mohede, Inge', 'Hontecillas, Raquel']","['Bassaganya-Riera J', 'Pogranichniy RM', 'Jobgen SC', 'Halbur PG', 'Yoon KJ', ""O'Shea M"", 'Mohede I', 'Hontecillas R']","['Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Nutrition Laboratory, Department of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA. jbassaga@vt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,2003/10/02 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/133.10.3204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2003 Oct;133(10):3204-14. doi: 10.1093/jn/133.10.3204.,"['0 (Dietary Fats, Unsaturated)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Circoviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Circovirus/growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/analysis', 'Interleukin-12/genetics', 'Interleukin-18/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Linoleic Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphopenia/virology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics', 'Swine', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G3139 (Genasense, oblimersen; Genta Inc.), a Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide, has been shown to down-regulate the Bcl-2 protein and induce apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells from treated patients. We tested G3139 for its ability to inhibit BCR-ABL-mediated transformation in mice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nude mice (n = 5/group) were transplanted s.c. with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-transformed TF-1 cells (BCR-ABL-TF-1-R cells). Mice with established tumors (0.1 g) were treated for 14 days with G3139 (7 mg/kg/day i.p.), or with the reverse-sequence control oligonucleotide G3622 (7 mg/kg/day i.p.) or with imatinib (50 mg/kg/day i.p.). RESULTS: Mice treated with G3622 or imatinib died within 10-12 weeks. Nearly all of the mice treated with G3139 survived for >6 months and had reduced tumor volume. Three of the 5 mice showed complete tumor regression. A transient decrease in Bcl-2 protein was observed that correlated with histological evidence of apoptosis. In addition, we harvested BCR-ABL-TF-1-R tumor cells from mice treated with G3139 or control G3622 (7 mg/kg/day i.p., 7 days). Cells were then cultured with the antileukemic agents imatinib, daunorubicin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, or etoposide. G3139 pretreatment resulted in enhanced induction of apoptosis by all of the agents. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that G3139 is a promising candidate for treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant Ph-positive leukemia, and that combination of G3139 and imatinib may be useful to circumvent clinically acquired imatinib resistance.","['Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Sumi, Masahiko', 'Nakajima, Akihiro', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Shimamoto, Takashi', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Tauchi T', 'Sumi M', 'Nakajima A', 'Sashida G', 'Shimamoto T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. tauchi@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/10/02 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 15;9(11):4267-73.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thionucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trioma cells that potentially include all lymphoma-derived antigens will be targeted to professional antigen-presenting cells in vivo. This allows uptake, processing, and presentation of tumor-derived antigens to T lymphocytes. In a mouse model, vaccination with trioma cells conferred long-lasting, T cell-dependent tumor immunity and was even able to eradicate established lymphomas. Here, we investigated whether this potent approach is effective in the human system. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Malignant cells from 11 patients with B cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were fused to an anti-Fc receptor hybridoma. The resulting trioma cells were extensively characterized with respect to their clonal origin. The induction of autologous tumor-specific T lymphocytes in the presence of trioma and antigen-presenting cells was examined in vitro by determining cytokine secretion in coculture assays. RESULTS: In seven cases, trioma cells could successfully be generated from B-CLL cells. Stimulation of autologous lymphocytes with trioma cells induced a leukemia-specific T-cell response. Immunostimulatory trioma cells were also obtained from two patients with solid B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Trioma-mediated immunization may be a promising adjuvant treatment of human malignancies of the B-cell lineage, particularly of B-CLL, which has still a very poor prognosis.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia were treated with 0.6-1.9 mg/m(2)/day oral topotecan for 5 consecutive days on and 2 days off, for 3 weeks (15 doses/course) followed by 2-4 weeks of rest. The DLTs occurring during the first course of treatment were considered for defining the MTD. Preliminary results of antitumor activity were assessed by examining bone marrow status and peripheral blood cell counts. RESULTS: All 26 patients enrolled in the study were evaluable for toxicity, and 24 patients were evaluable for response. A total of 54 courses were administered. The most frequently reported nonhematological toxicities (percentage of courses) were diarrhea (57%), nausea/vomiting (50%), fatigue (24%), and mucositis (9%). DLTs included grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting and diarrhea at 1.9 mg/m(2)/day. The MTD for oral topotecan in patients with hematological malignancies was defined at 1.4 mg/m(2)/day. Hematological toxicity was noted in all 26 patients and with all courses but was not considered dose-limiting. Four (17%) patients achieved a complete response, and six (25%) patients experienced hematological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Protracted administration of oral topotecan is safe and well tolerated in patients with hematological malignancies. At the dose-schedule used, single-agent oral topotecan has a definite activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia and warrants further investigation alone or in combination with other agents.","['Beran, Miloslav', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Tran, Hai T', 'Cortes-Franco, Jorge E', 'Giles, Francis', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Beran M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Thomas DA', 'Tran HT', 'Cortes-Franco JE', 'Giles F', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian HM']","['The University of Texas M.

Advances in these techniques have increased knowledge of the various genes involved in tumoral development. Genetic alterations can occur in three large groups of genes: oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. Cytogenetic analyses (karyotyping) are complemented by various molecular techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and spectral karyotyping (SKY). These are the most reliable techniques and improve the sensitivity of karyotyping. The present article reviews the most representative and best characterized genes involved in the molecular etiology of childhood cancer, both hematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma) and solid tumors (brain tumors, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and retinoblastoma). Molecular techniques have enabled more precise diagnosis as well as identification of new prognostic factors and the development of more effective treatments. These techniques can also be useful in identifying minimal residual disease during and after treatment for leukemias, neuroblastomas and sarcomas, with the aim of predicting recurrence.","['Lopez Almaraz, R', 'Montesdeoca Melian, A', 'Rodriguez Luis, J']","['Lopez Almaraz R', 'Montesdeoca Melian A', 'Rodriguez Luis J']","['Servicio de Pediatria, Unidad de Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario de Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife, Espana. ritxil@comtf.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,2003/10/02 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['13051317 [pii]', '10.1016/s1695-4033(03)78192-2 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2003 Oct;59(4):334-44. doi: 10.1016/s1695-4033(03)78192-2.,,IM,"['Child', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Molecular Biology/trends', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics']",,,67,,,,,Papel de la genetica molecular en el cancer infantil.,,,,,,,

The thermodynamic parameters of drug-DNA complexation were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. By comparing the activities of compounds with different terminal groups (amino, dimethylamino and diethylamino), we found that the existence of a terminal dimethylamino group in the alkylamino side chain is an important factor for anti-tumour activity. Minor modifications in the dimethylaminoalkyl side chain (e.g. elongation by one methylene group) led to notable changes in both the anti-tumour activity and DNA-binding properties of the drug, providing unambiguous evidence of a marked structure-activity relation.","['Veselkov, Alexei N', 'Maleev, Vladimir Ya', 'Glibin, Evgenie N', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Davies, David B']","['Veselkov AN', 'Maleev VY', 'Glibin EN', 'Karawajew L', 'Davies DB']","['Department of Physics and Chemistry, Sevastopol National Technical University, Crimea, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,2003/10/02 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['3817 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03817.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2003 Oct;270(20):4200-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03817.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '1916-63-8 (phenoxazinone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Oxazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old man developed generalized erythroderma and itching due to infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus. Despite application of strong glucocorticosteroid ointments, the symptoms and area of erythroderma were not alleviated. Daily topical application of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was added and therapeutic drug monitoring was started. The dose and applied area of tacrolimus were gradually increased from 2.5 to 12.5 g/d and from 10% to 90% of body surface area, respectively. Because the trough concentration of tacrolimus in whole blood increased from 7.5 ng/mL on treatment day 9 to 15.4 ng/mL on day 13, the dose was reduced to 10 g/d. However, the concentration further elevated to 16.5 ng/mL. Therefore, the applied area was reduced to 20% of body surface area, and the tacrolimus concentration decreased gradually thereafter. Although the transient increase of blood tacrolimus concentration was observed on day 23, treatment with 20% applied area and 5 g/d were maintained. DISCUSSION: Topically applied tacrolimus was substantially absorbed with the expansion of its applied area and dose. Increased tacrolimus concentrations may have a tendency to depend on the increase of the percent of body surface area per dose. Our findings showing the elevation of blood tacrolimus concentration after application of the ointment to a large area of the body suggest that the applied area should be as narrow as possible in a barrier-disrupted condition such as erythroderma. However, the safety of tacrolimus ointment has not been established in patients with generalized erythroderma. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus concentrations in whole blood should be carefully monitored to prevent nephrotoxicity. Based on the results of that monitoring, the application area and dose of tacrolimus ointment should be closely adjusted, especially in generalized erythrodermic cases.","['Teshima, Daisuke', 'Ikesue, Hiroaki', 'Itoh, Yoshinori', 'Urabe, Kazunori', 'Furue, Masutaka', 'Oishi, Ryozo']","['Teshima D', 'Ikesue H', 'Itoh Y', 'Urabe K', 'Furue M', 'Oishi R']","['Department of Pharmacy, Kyushu University Hospital, Maidashi, Fukuoka, Japan. dteshima@st.hosp.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,2003/10/02 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/10/02 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.1D082 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2003 Oct;37(10):1444-7. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D082.,"['0 (Ointments)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Adult', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/complications/diagnosis', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Ointments', 'Pruritus/drug therapy', 'Skin Absorption/drug effects', 'Tacrolimus/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent results have suggested the feasibility of constructing such a classifier with reasonable predictive accuracy under the circumstance where only a small number of cancer tissue samples of known type are available. Difficulty arises from the fact that each sample contains the expression data of a vast number of genes and these genes may interact with one another. Selection of a small number of critical genes is fundamental to correctly analyze the otherwise overwhelming data. It is essential to use a multivariate approach for capturing the correlated structure in the data. However, the curse of dimensionality leads to the concern about the reliability of selected genes. Here, we present a new gene selection method in which error and repeatability of selected genes are assessed within the context of M-fold cross-validation.

One of the mechanisms involved in this resistance is the presence of glycoprotein P170 (gp-P 170), which results of the MDR-1 gene in leukemic cells. The objective of this article is to assess the prognostic impact of the expression of MDR-1 in a group of patients treated for AML. The expression of MDR-1 was retrospectively assessed in a cohort of 55 patients with AML, older than 16 years old, who received chemotherapy from 1990 to 2000. The presence of MDR-1/gp-P170 was evaluated on bone marrow biopsy by immunohisto-chemistry. A ROC curve established that an expression of > 50% of MDR-1 on blastic cells was significant for the achievement of complete remission. The expression of MDR-1+ correlated with the presence of leucocytosis (p:0.002), expression of CD34+ cells (p:0.006), less achievement of complete remission (p:0.001), more rate of relapse (p:0.02) and of non-favorable cytogenetics (p:0.02). The event-free survival was of 21.2% SE:9.3 with a follow up of 22 months for the group of MDR-1+ versus 56.4% SE 12.5 with a follow-up of 78 months for the MDR-1-group (p:0.007). It can be concluded that the expression of MDR-1 is a prognostic factor of resistance to chemotherapy.

The spatially correlated random effects have been proposed in an attempt to capture a general clustering in the data. As an alternative, we propose replacing the spatially structured random effect with fixed clustering effects associated with particular areas. A reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm for posterior inference is described. We illustrate the model using the well-known New York leukaemia data.","['Gangnon, Ronald E', 'Clayton, Murray K']","['Gangnon RE', 'Clayton MK']","['Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 610 N.

The best dose of IFN-alpha in the treatment of CML still remains controversial. Our primary objective was to compare cytogenetic responses in patients treated with intermediate versus high doses of IFN-alpha. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 109 patients with untreated CML in chronic phase from 26 Spanish hospitals. Patients were assigned to receive either an intermediate (2.5 MU/m(2) per day) or high (5 MU/m(2) per day) target dose of IFN-alpha. Hydroxyurea was allowed in both groups. In total, 108 patients were analyzed, 53 in the intermediate- and 55 in the high-dose group. Median follow-up was 47.5 months. The dose of IFN-alpha actually given was lower in the intermediate-dose group (3.83 MU/day) than in the high-dose group (6.6 MU/day) ( p<0.001). The rate of complete cytogenetic response was 24.5% in the intermediate- and 12.7% in the high-dose group (NS). A partial cytogenetic response was obtained in 7.5% and 10.9%, respectively. Cox analysis did not reveal any influence of the randomization arm on cytogenetic response rate. Ten patients in each group discontinued IFN-alpha because of toxicity. Albeit not our primary objective, no differences were found in terms of survival or transformation rate between both groups. Median survival was 73 months; 64% of patients remained free of transformation at 5 years. In terms of cytogenetic response, intermediate doses of IFN-alpha are as effective as high doses in the treatment of CML.","['Penarrubia, M J', 'Odriozola, J', 'Gonzalez, C', 'Massague, I', 'Miguel, A', 'Gonzalez San Miguel, J D', 'Perez Encinas, M', 'Lavilla, E', 'Giraldo, M P', 'Casado, L F', 'Ferrer, S', 'Steegmann, J L']","['Penarrubia MJ', 'Odriozola J', 'Gonzalez C', 'Massague I', 'Miguel A', 'Gonzalez San Miguel JD', 'Perez Encinas M', 'Lavilla E', 'Giraldo MP', 'Casado LF', 'Ferrer S', 'Steegmann JL']","['S.

Given its pathophysiological importance, an investigation of the natural substrate specificity of this metalloprotease is presented here through the application of enzyme-substrate modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the substrate modeled, LATAC downward arrow FG, satisfies a complementary backbone H-bonding with Ala543-Tyr545, thereby suggested to be the putative substrate-binding beta-sheet, analogously to matrix metalloproteases. The modeling further suggests that phenylalanine at the P1' position (substrate) is directed in the same fashion as the synthetic inhibitor of the reference crystal structure and that this enzyme does not bind the P3'/P4' positions of a substrate, as other metalloproteases do. After a specific comparison with one member of the matrix metalloproteases, MMP-3, a common conserved valine residue at the primary S1' subsite was found to be shared between these two otherwise different proteases. These results may prove useful for selective drug design for neprilysin, and lay a foundation for future subsite analysis for other members of the neprilysin family.","['Manzetti, Sergio']",['Manzetti S'],"['Proinformatix.com, Lippestad, 1825 Tomter, Norway.

The function of Daxx in apoptosis is controversial because opposite results were obtained in transient overexpression and genetic knockout studies. Furthermore, the roles of PML and transcriptional repression in Daxx-regulated apoptosis are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Daxx in Fas- and stress-induced apoptosis by small interfering RNA-mediated Daxx silencing in mammalian cells. Daxx silencing had no apparent cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells within 72 h. Intriguingly, Daxx silencing strongly sensitized cells to Fas- and stress-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and Jun N-terminal kinase activation. Consistently, endogenous Daxx was degraded rapidly upon induction of apoptosis by stress or anti-Fas antibody. Finally, PML silencing had no effect on Daxx silencing-mediated apoptotic events, while caspase gene expression was upregulated in the absence of Daxx. These data strongly suggest that Daxx may inhibit Fas and stress-mediated apoptosis by suppressing proapoptotic gene expression outside of PML domains.","['Chen, Liuh-Yow', 'Chen, J Don']","['Chen LY', 'Chen JD']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,2003/10/01 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/01 05:00'],"['2003/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.20.7108-7121.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Oct;23(20):7108-21. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.20.7108-7121.2003.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Silencing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Up-Regulation']","['R01 CA087074-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,PMC230316,,,

Recently, mutations that abrogated transcriptional activation of C/EBPalpha were detected in acute myeloid leukemia patient samples. Moreover, the progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to blast crisis in patients was correlated with down-modulation of C/EBPalpha. The KCL22 cell line, derived from BCR-ABL+ CML in blast crisis, expressed wild-type C/EBPepsilon protein but not a functional C/EBPalpha, -beta, and -gamma. Restoration of C/EBPalpha expression in KCL22 cells triggered a profound proliferative arrest, a block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and a gradual increase in apoptosis. Within 3 days of inducing expression of C/EBPalpha, a remarkable neutrophilic differentiation of the KCL22 blast cells occurred as shown by morphologic changes, induction of expression of CD11b, primary, secondary, and tertiary granule proteins, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. Using high density oligonucleotide microarrays, the gene expression profile of KCL22 cells stably transfected with C/EBPalpha was compared with that of empty vector, and we identified genes not previously known to be regulated by C/EBPalpha. These included the up-regulation of those genes important for regulation of hematopoietic stem cell homing, granulocytic differentiation, and cell cycle, whereas down-regulation occurred for genes coding for signaling molecules and transcription factors that are implicated in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Our study showed that restoration of C/EBPalpha expression in BCR-ABL+ leukemic cells in blast crisis is sufficient for rapid neutrophil differentiation suggesting a potential therapeutic role for ectopic transfer of C/EBPalpha in acute phase of CML.","['Tavor, Sigal', 'Park, Dorothy J', 'Gery, Sigal', 'Vuong, Peter T', 'Gombart, Adrian F', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Tavor S', 'Park DJ', 'Gery S', 'Vuong PT', 'Gombart AF', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/10/01 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/01 05:00'],"['2003/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M307077200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75277-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 26;278(52):52651-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M307077200.

Similar to other viruses, cellular expression of the FV Env protein is sufficient to induce resistance to exogenous FV, a phenomenon called superinfection resistance (SIR). In this study we define determinants of the FV Env protein essential for mediating SIR. FV Env requires the extracellular domains of the SU and the TM subunits as well as membrane anchorage, efficient cell surface transport, and most probably correct subunit processing. This is in contrast to murine leukemia virus where secreted proteins comprising the receptor-binding domain in SU are sufficient to induce SIR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cellular expression of the prototype FV envelope proteins induces SIR against pseudotypes with glycoproteins of other FV species, including of simian, feline, bovine, and equine origin. This implies that all of them use the same receptor molecules for viral entry.","['Berg, Angelika', 'Pietschmann, Thomas', 'Rethwilm, Axel', 'Lindemann, Dirk']","['Berg A', 'Pietschmann T', 'Rethwilm A', 'Lindemann D']","['Institut fur Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universitat Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,2003/10/01 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/10/01 05:00'],"['2003/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['S004268220300401X [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00401-x [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Sep 15;314(1):243-52. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00401-x.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Spumavirus/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the profile of which integrins are employed for adhesion to a given disintegrin domain remains unclear. For example, we suggested that the disintegrin domains of mouse sperm ADAMs 2 and 3 can interact with the alpha6beta1 integrin on mouse eggs. Others concluded that these disintegrin domains interact instead with the alpha9beta1 integrin. To address these differing results, we first studied adhesion of mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and human G361 melanoma cells to the disintegrin domains of mouse ADAMs 2 and 3. Both cell lines express alpha6beta1 and alpha9beta1 integrins at their surfaces. Antibodies to the alpha6 integrin subunit inhibited adhesion of both cell lines. An antibody that recognizes human alpha9 integrin inhibited adhesion of G361 cells. VLO5, a snake disintegrin that antagonizes alpha4beta1 and alpha9beta1 integrins, potently inhibited adhesion of both cell lines. We next explored expression of the alpha9 integrin subunit in mouse eggs. In contrast to our ability to detect alpha6beta1, we were unable to convincingly detect alpha9beta1 integrin on the surface of mouse eggs. Moreover, treatment of mouse eggs with 250 nm VLO5, which is 250 fold over its approximately IC(50) for inhibition of somatic cell adhesion, had minimal effect on sperm-egg binding or fusion. We did detect alpha9 integrin protein on epithelial cells of the oviduct. Additional studies showed that antibodies to the alpha6 and alpha7 integrins additively inhibited adhesion of mouse trophoblast stem cells and that an antibody to the alpha4 integrin inhibited adhesion of MOLT-3 cells to these disintegrin domains: Our data suggest that multiple integrins (on the same cell) can participate in adhesion to a given ADAM disintegrin domain and that interactions between ADAMs and integrins may be important for sperm transit through the oviduct.","['Tomczuk, Monika', 'Takahashi, Yuji', 'Huang, Jing', 'Murase, Shin', 'Mistretta, Marie', 'Klaffky, Erin', 'Sutherland, Ann', 'Bolling, Laura', 'Coonrod, Scott', 'Marcinkiewicz, Cezary', 'Sheppard, Dean', 'Stepp, Mary-Ann', 'White, Judith M']","['Tomczuk M', 'Takahashi Y', 'Huang J', 'Murase S', 'Mistretta M', 'Klaffky E', 'Sutherland A', 'Bolling L', 'Coonrod S', 'Marcinkiewicz C', 'Sheppard D', 'Stepp MA', 'White JM']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0732, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,2003/10/01 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/10/01 05:00'],"['2003/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482703003070 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00307-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Oct 15;290(1):68-81. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00307-0.,"['0 (ADAM 3)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Disintegrins)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Snake Venoms)', '0 (integrin alpha9)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Fertilins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Disintegrins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Female', 'Fertilins', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha Chains/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Integrin beta1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oviducts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ovum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Snake Venoms/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['EY08512/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23244/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM48739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD034807/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL64353/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleotide sequences were compared with other previously characterized BLV variants from different geographical areas (Belgium, France, Italy, North America, Australia, Japan and Argentina). The majority of analyzed segments had a tendency for nucleotide substitution without changing the amino acid.

Clinical observations that the infusions of allogeneic T-cells can successfully induce remissions in the majority of patients with CML in relapse after allo-SCT lead the way to the exploitation of non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning for the initial allografting. Current results of reduced-intensity transplants for CML in chronic phase are encouraging, although the incidence of graft rejection and intractable GVHD still remains a great challenge.

METHODS: Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy of 5 patients with Gaucher disease was started on January 2001. In 4 patients the typical signs of Gaucher disease (organomegaly, bone changes, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) were documented at the time of diagnosis. One patient received bone marrow stem cell transplant as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia from a HLA-matching sibling with Gaucher disease. All patients underwent therapy with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) infusion every 14 days. The outcome and actual cost of the treatment were followed during 12 months. RESULTS: After 3 months of therapy, hemoglobin rose above low normal range in 2 patients. After 6 months, 3 patients had platelet count above 100x10(9)/L, and bone pain crises completely disappeared in patients with severe bone involvement. After 12 months, normal blood counts were restored in all patients. At the same time point, bone destruction remained unchanged in 3 patients and showed marked improvement in one. In agreement with the Ministry of Health, the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance restructured its funds and established a special ""Fund for expensive drugs.""

The distinction of patients at high versus low risk for severe bacterial infection (SBI) is not fully established. The purpose of this study was to define a rule predicting the risk to develop SBI in children and adolescents with FN, based on information accessible at presentation. PROCEDURE: Information accessible within 2 hr from presentation was collected retrospectively on all pediatric cancer patients presenting with FN from 1993 to 2001 in a single institution. Patients with established SBI at presentation were excluded. After univariate analyses, two multivariate models predicting the risk of SBI were constructed and their performance evaluated using crossvalidation. RESULTS: An SBI developed in 106 (37%) of 285 episodes of 111 children. The logistic regression model outperformed the decision tree model in predicting SBI. It was based on seven variables: bone marrow involvement, no clinical signs of viral infection, high level of C-reactive protein, high hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, presence of central venous catheter, and diagnosis of pre-B-cell leukemia. At 96% sensitivity, the crossvalidated specificity was 26%, and the negative predictive value 91%. CONCLUSIONS: Combining selected information accessible at presentation, SBI in FN can be predicted with clinically useful specificity maintaining very high sensitivity. Induction therapy and absence of clinical signs of viral infection were identified as new predictors of SBI. The results of this study need confirmation and refinement in prospective studies, aiming at more selective management of FN in pediatric oncology.","['Ammann, Roland A', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Luthy, Annette Ridolfi', 'Aebi, Christoph']","['Ammann RA', 'Hirt A', 'Luthy AR', 'Aebi C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. roland.ammann@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,2003/09/30 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/09/30 05:00'],"['2003/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10320 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Nov;41(5):436-43. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10320.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

It is thought that changes in expression of neuropeptides and other molecules in injured neurons are mediated by new factors produced in Schwann and immune cells at the injury site, a loss of target-derived factors, or a combination of mediators. To begin to determine the role of the inflammatory mediators, we investigated axotomy-induced changes in VIP and PACAP gene expression in the facial motor nucleus in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, and in mice with targeted mutations in specific cytokine genes. In normal mice, VIP and PACAP mRNA was induced strongly in facial motor neurons 4 days after axotomy. The increase in PACAP mRNA was blocked selectively in SCID mice, indicating that mechanisms responsible for VIP and PACAP gene induction are not identical. The loss of PACAP gene expression in SCID mice after axotomy was fully reversed by an infusion of normal splenocytes, suggesting that PACAP mRNA induction requires inflammatory mediators. PACAP and VIP mRNA inductions, however, were maintained in mice lacking leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and in mice lacking both receptors for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The data suggest that an inflammatory response, most likely involving T lymphocytes, is necessary for the axotomy-induced increase in PACAP but not in VIP. LIF, IL-6, and TNFalpha, however, are not required for this response to injury.","['Armstrong, Brian D', 'Hu, Zhongting', 'Abad, Catalina', 'Yamamoto, Miya', 'Rodriguez, Williams I', 'Cheng, Jennifer', 'Tam, Jimmy', 'Gomariz, Rosa P', 'Patterson, Paul H', 'Waschek, James A']","['Armstrong BD', 'Hu Z', 'Abad C', 'Yamamoto M', 'Rodriguez WI', 'Cheng J', 'Tam J', 'Gomariz RP', 'Patterson PH', 'Waschek JA']","['Mental Retardation Research Center, Neuropsychiatric Institute, The David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles 90024-1759, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,2003/09/30 05:00,2003/12/17 05:00,['2003/09/30 05:00'],"['2003/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.10750 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2003 Oct 15;74(2):240-7. doi: 10.1002/jnr.10750.,"['0 (Adcyap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Adcyap1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axotomy', 'Cytokines/deficiency/genetics', 'Facial Nerve/immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Facial Nerve Injuries/genetics/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Motor Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neuropeptides/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retrograde Degeneration/genetics/immunology/physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism']","['HD04612/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD06576/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

The human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cell line differentiated along the macrophage or neutrophil lineage is a model system that is frequently used for the generation of ROS by various agents. As a primary source of ROS the superoxide anion produced by an enzymatic complex, NADPH oxidase, is well established. The present study shows that nondifferentiated HL60 cells contain NADPH oxidase and can be used as a model for the assessment of oxidant as well as antioxidant compounds. The expression of the multicomponent NADPH oxidase was demonstrated in nondifferentiated HL60 cells at the molecular level by detection of the mRNAs of the components gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox as well as functionally by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated generation of superoxide, which was susceptible to inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium. The functional assay was performed using the cells in a log growth phase by adapting a standard microplate assay based on the classic superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c. Validation of the microplate assay was carried out both with nonadherent differentiated HL60 cells and the adherent mouse monocyte-macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line, as well as with various compounds of oxidant (bleomycin sulfate, cis-diammineplatinum(II), camptothecin, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta), nonoxidant (4 alpha-PMA, piracetam), and antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid) activity.

Microscopic examination of a blood smear should be performed to detect the presence of these so called pseudoplatelets. When present, the platelet count should be corrected because of the important clinical consequences that a lower platelet count may have in these patients. METHODS: K(3)EDTA anticoagulated blood was measured on an automated blood cell counter, and a blood smear was made and stained according the May Grunwald-Giemsa method for microscopic observation. A 500 cell/particle differentiation was performed and the automated platelet count was corrected. RESULTS: The incidence of pseudoplatelets in 169 patients with acute leukaemia was studied. Pseudoplatelets were detected in 43 patients (25.4%), and seven patients (4.1%) were re-classified as having a major bleeding risk (platelet count, < 15 x 10(9)/litre). CONCLUSIONS: Platelets should be determined morphologically in patients with acute leukaemia and a routine screening method for the detection of pseudoplatelets should be developed.","['van der Meer, W', 'MacKenzie, M A', 'Dinnissen, J W B', 'de Keijzer, M H']","['van der Meer W', 'MacKenzie MA', 'Dinnissen JW', 'de Keijzer MH']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Centre St Radboud, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. w.vandermeer@akc.umcn.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,2003/09/30 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/30 05:00'],"['2003/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.56.10.772 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2003 Oct;56(10):772-4. doi: 10.1136/jcp.56.10.772.,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1770090,,,

COMBO-FISH takes advantage of homopurine/homopyrimidine oligonucleotides that form triple helices with intact duplex genomic DNA, without the need for prior denaturation of the target sequence that is usually applied for probe binding in standard FISH protocols. An analysis of human genome databases has shown that homopurine/homopyrimidine sequences longer than 14 bp are nearly homogeneously distributed over the genome, and they represent from 1% to 2% of the entire genome. Because the observation volume in a confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a high numerical aperture lens typically corresponds to an approximate 250-kb chromatin domain in a normal mammalian cell nucleus, this volume should contain 150-200 homopurine/homopyrimidine stretches. Using DNA database information, one can configure a set of distinct, uniformly labeled oligonucleotide probes from these stretches that is expected to exclusively co-localize within a 250-kb chromatin domain. Due to the diffraction-limited resolution of a microscope, the fluorescence signals of the configured oligonucleotide probe set merge into a typical, nearly homogenous FISH spot. Using a set of 32 homopyrimidine probes, we performed experiments in the Abelson murine leukemia region of human chromosome 9 as some of the very first proofs-of-principle of COMBO-FISH. Although the experimental protocol currently contains several steps that are incompatible with living cell conditions, the theoretical approach may be the first methodological advance toward the long-term but still elusive goal of carrying out specific FISH in high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of vital cells.","['Hausmann, Michael', 'Winkler, Ralph', 'Hildenbrand, Georg', 'Finsterle, Jutta', 'Weisel, Andrea', 'Rapp, Alexander', 'Schmitt, Eberhard', 'Janz, Siegfried', 'Cremer, Christoph']","['Hausmann M', 'Winkler R', 'Hildenbrand G', 'Finsterle J', 'Weisel A', 'Rapp A', 'Schmitt E', 'Janz S', 'Cremer C']","['Kirchhoff-Institute of Physics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg. mihaus@ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,2003/09/30 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/09/30 05:00'],"['2003/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2144/03353rr03 [doi]'],ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2003 Sep;35(3):564-70, 572-7. doi: 10.2144/03353rr03.","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques/*methods', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', '*Oligonucleotide Probes/*chemical synthesis', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', '*Software']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 63-year-old Japanese man with MDS was admitted to our hospital because of a large skin ulcer on his neck in November 2001. The initial diagnosis was infectious dermatitis, and antimicrobial therapy was performed, using imipenem/cilastatin, isepamicin, and amphotericin B. However, this therapy was not effective, and the lesion worsened. Cultures of blood, throat swab, and ulcer pus yielded no microorganisms. A biopsy of the skin lesion revealed a severe infiltration of neutrophils in the dermis, without any evidence of infection. The lesion was finally diagnosed as PG, and systemic administration of corticosteroid hormone was started in December 2001. The patient was initially pulsed with 1 g methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. The dose was immediately reduced, and the treatment was maintained with 30 mg prednisolone daily. The skin lesion responded markedly to the therapy, and C-reactive protein became negative. The patient was discharged in February 2002 because the lesion was almost cured. Prednisolone administration was tapered after 6-month maintenance therapy. No recurrence of PG was seen, although his MDS transformed into leukemia in April 2003. Only 31 cases of MDS developing PG have been reported in the past 20 years in Japan. This report describes one such rare patient who was successfully treated with the use of high-dose pulse methylprednisolone and long-term maintenance therapy.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ishida, Kentaro', 'Iwashima, Yoshiko', 'Ikegaya, Satoshi', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Wakahara, Mami', 'Kumakiri, Masanobu', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Ishida K', 'Iwashima Y', 'Ikegaya S', 'Kawai Y', 'Wakahara M', 'Kumakiri M', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, 23, Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10156-003-0254-6 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(04)71134-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2003 Sep;9(3):268-71. doi: 10.1007/s10156-003-0254-6.,['X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)'],IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Neck', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Skin Ulcer/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that the LARG protein activates RhoA, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, by catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP. Experiments in Drosophila melanogaster have implicated RhoA and its regulators in a spectrum of developmental processes-including gastrulation, neurite outgrowth, and epidermal morphogenesis; however, the role of these genes during mammalian development is incompletely understood. Herein, we investigate the expression of the murine LARG homologue during embryogenesis and in adult animals, by a combination of mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical detection of the LARG protein. We observe that LARG transcript and protein are undetectable prior to embryonic day 14. Beginning at this stage, LARG is expressed in the skin, intestinal epithelium, and smooth muscle layers of the intestine, bronchi, and vasculature. This specific distribution is maintained at later stages of development and into adulthood. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of the LARG protein with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) receptor, suggesting a potential physiologic role for LARG as an activator of RhoA in response to IGF-1.","['Becknell, Brian', 'Shen, Tiansheng', 'Maghraby, Eman', 'Taya, Shinichiro', 'Kaibuchi, Kozo', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Becknell B', 'Shen T', 'Maghraby E', 'Taya S', 'Kaibuchi K', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G']","['Integrated Biomedical Science Graduate Program, College of Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,2003/09/27 05:00,2004/09/02 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00441-003-0802-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2003 Dec;314(3):361-6. doi: 10.1007/s00441-003-0802-5.

We analyzed the inactivation of the INK4 family CKI/CDK/RB pathway by gene promoter hypermethylation in leukemogenesis. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) with primers for methylated (M-MSP) and unmethylated (U-MSP) alleles of the p15, p16, p18, and RB genes was used to study five leukemic cell lines, 50 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 25 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. None of the leukemic cell lines showed p18 and RB methylation. p15 was methylated in Raji, while p16 was methylated in U937 and Raji. In NB4 and Jurkat, both alleles of p15 and p16 appeared to be deleted. At diagnosis, p15 methylation occurred in 29 (58%) AML patients, and 10 (40.0%) ALL patients. p16 methylation occurred in two (4%) AML and two (8%) ALL patients. Only one each of AML and ALL patients had concurrent p15 and p16 methylation. None of the patients had methylation of p18 or RB. In AML, p15 methylation was associated with M2 subtype ( p=0.018). Patients with and without p15 methylation had similar complete remission (CR) rates and projected 5-year overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). Therefore, methylation inactivation of the INK4/CDK/RB pathway in leukemia involved primarily p15 and occasionally p16, but not p18 or RB.

Sequential (but not simultaneous) exposure of MM.1S cells to bortezomib or MG-132 (10 h) followed by HA14-1 (8 h) resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury (loss of DeltaPsim, cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor release), activation of procaspases-3, -8, and -9, and Bid, induction of apoptosis, and loss of clonogenicity. Similar interactions were observed in U266 and MM.1R dexamethasone-resistant myeloma cells. These events were associated with Bcl-2 cleavage, Bax, Bak, and Bad accumulation, mitochondrial translocation of Bax, abrogation of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and XIAP upregulation, and a marked induction of JNK and p53. Bortezomib/HA14-1 treatment triggered an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, along with apoptosis, was blocked by the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC). L-NAC also opposed bortezomib/HA14-1-mediated JNK activation, upregulation of p53 and Bax, and release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. Finally, bortezomib/HA14-1-mediated apoptosis was unaffected by exogenous IL-6. Together, these findings indicate that sequential exposure of myeloma cells to proteasome and small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors such as HA14-1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in myeloma.","['Pei, X-Y', 'Dai, Y', 'Grant, S']","['Pei XY', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403109 [doi]', '2403109 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):2036-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403109.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Boronic Acids/*toxicity', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cytochrome c Group/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Protease Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Pyrazines/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PC of 25/48 (52%) patients with t(11;14) exhibited a lymphoplasmacytoid morphology. Moreover, 25/27 (93%) of the cases with this morphological profile bore the t(11;14).

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is believed to play a role in tumor angiogenesis. We studied the expression of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR1 or Flt-1 and VEGFR2 or Flk-1/KDR) by myeloma cell lines and plasma cells isolated from patients, using different methods. VEGF expression by the plasma cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in 18 of 20 patients with MM. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated VEGF secretion in all six different myeloma cell lines studied. Five patient marrow samples and seven different myeloma cell lines were then studied for VEGF mRNA expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was positive in all. We further evaluated the expression of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in different myeloma cell lines and five sorted myeloma bone marrow samples by RT-PCR. All the myeloma cell lines expressed VEGFR1 and three of the cell lines expressed VEGFR2. VEGFR1 expression was detected in all and VEGFR2 in all but one of the sorted marrow samples. Increased expression of VEGF by the myeloma cells taken in the context of the suspected prognostic value of marrow angiogenesis suggests a pathogenetic role for this cytokine and presence of its receptors on myeloma cells points toward an autocrine mechanism.

We did not detect any transcriptional upregulation of hTERT mRNA, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of telomerase activation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the telomere binding protein TRF2 was upregulated early and reversibly after etoposide treatment. TRF1 mRNA expression levels were unchanged after DNA damage, but increased when the cells accumulated in the G2/M phase. The data show that the telosome reacts after DNA damage by upregulating telomerase activity and TRF2 expression in malignant cells. It has previously been shown that overexpression of TRF2 can repress senescence signals arising from critically shortened telomeres. We show here that TRF2 is upregulated by undirected DNA damage that also affects the telomeric DNA. These data suggest that upregulation of telomerase activity and TRF2 expression might act as antiapoptotic mechanisms in the DNA-damage response of malignant cells.","['Klapper, W', 'Qian, W', 'Schulte, C', 'Parwaresch, R']","['Klapper W', 'Qian W', 'Schulte C', 'Parwaresch R']","['Department of Hematopathology and Lymph Node Registry Kiel, Niemannsweg Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403086 [doi]', '2403086 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):2007-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403086.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was followed by the activation of caspase-9 as the apical caspase and subsequent activation of effector caspases. CLL cells undergoing apoptosis showed a rapid caspase-mediated cleavage of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family implicated in CLL survival and poor prognosis. This cleavage was mediated primarily by caspase-3. Cleavage of Mcl-1 may provide a feed-forward amplification loop, resulting in the rapid induction of apoptosis.

It is currently an incurable disease, making new treatment options such as immunotherapy desirable. Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to surface antigens of the tumor cell is one option. Administration of cytotoxic cells such as natural killer (NK) and natural killer-like T (NKT) cells expanded in vitro might be a useful treatment modality alone or in combination with MAbs. A limiting step in the development of successful cellular immunotherapy has been the availability of appropriate cytotoxic cells. Here, we report the feasibility of expanding populations of the human killer cells, CD3-CD56+ NK and CD3+CD56+ NKT cells, from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of B-CLL patients. The influence of tumor B cells on the in vitro expansion of killer cells was assessed by depleting B cells from PBMCs by microbead separation before culture. The 21-day cultures from both B-cell- and non-B-cell-depleted PBMC showed a marked expansion of NK cells, and also of T cells, among which almost half had the NKT phenotype. Depletion of B cells before culture did not change the expansion rates of NK and NKT cells significantly. In patients with progressive B-CLL, NK cell expansion capacity was improved after fludarabine treatment when compared to samples obtained before treatment. Repeated samples of PBMCs from individual untreated patients with both indolent and progressive disease cultured under identical conditions gave similar NK cell expansion rates. Expanded killer cell populations had cytotoxic function against the NK-sensitive target K562 cell line and expressed high levels of Granzyme B. From our studies, we conclude that NK cells as well as NKT cells from the peripheral blood of B-CLL patients can be expanded, and that these cells have cytotoxic capacity.","['Guven, H', 'Gilljam, M', 'Chambers, B J', 'Ljunggren, H G', 'Christensson, B', 'Kimby, E', 'Dilber, M S']","['Guven H', 'Gilljam M', 'Chambers BJ', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Christensson B', 'Kimby E', 'Dilber MS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403083 [doi]', '2403083 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):1973-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403083.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):1945-7.

Cell subsets exceeding 1% of nucleated cells were subject to cell sorting. Chimaerism was analysed by dual-colour FISH and/or by short tandem repeat-polymerase chain reaction. The chimaerism pattern on day +28 was evaluated with regard to its correlation with graft rejection. Of 39 patients, nine patients had donor chimaerism (DC) in all subsets. Mixed/recipient chimaerism (MC/RC) was detectable within T cells in 62%, within NK cells in 39% and within monocytes and granulocytes in 38% of the patients. The correlation of secondary graft rejection with the chimaerism pattern on day +28 revealed the strongest association between RC in NK-cells (P<0.0001), followed by T cells (P=0.001), and granulocytes and monocytes (P=0.034). Notably, patients with RC in T cells rejected their graft only if MC or RC was also present in the NK-cell subset. By contrast, none of the children with DC in NK cells experienced a graft rejection. These observations suggest that, in the presence of recipient T-cell chimaerism, the chimaerism status in NK-cells on day +28 might be able to identify patients at high risk for late graft rejection.","['Matthes-Martin, S', 'Lion, T', 'Haas, O A', 'Frommlet, F', 'Daxberger, H', 'Konig, M', 'Printz, D', 'Scharner, D', 'Eichstill, C', 'Peters, C', 'Lawitschka, A', 'Gadner, H', 'Fritsch, G']","['Matthes-Martin S', 'Lion T', 'Haas OA', 'Frommlet F', 'Daxberger H', 'Konig M', 'Printz D', 'Scharner D', 'Eichstill C', 'Peters C', 'Lawitschka A', 'Gadner H', 'Fritsch G']","[""St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403087 [doi]', '2403087 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):1934-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403087.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/classification/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I-FISH is faster, less costly, and does not require BM aspiration. For patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFN), a good correlation between the two methods has been demonstrated in several though not all studies. However, imatinib mesylate (STI571) has largely replaced IFN as the standard drug treatment for CML, raising the question if the results obtained in IFN-treated patients are applicable to patients on imatinib. We therefore compared the two methods in patients on imatinib and patients on other therapies, mainly IFN (collectively referred to as nonimatinib therapies). Our results demonstrate that the correlation between I-FISH and cytogenetics is much weaker in patients on imatinib than in patients on nonimatinib therapies. Correction of the I-FISH values for the proportion of lymphocytes barely improved the correlation, probably as a result of unpredictable proportions of Philadelphia-positive B cells. By contrast, I-FISH of PB neutrophils was much better correlated with BM cytogenetics. We conclude that I-FISH on unselected PB white cells is not suitable for monitoring patients on imatinib.","['Reinhold, U', 'Hennig, E', 'Leiblein, S', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Deininger, M W N']","['Reinhold U', 'Hennig E', 'Leiblein S', 'Niederwieser D', 'Deininger MW']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403077 [doi]', '2403077 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Oct;17(10):1925-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403077.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology/*physiology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental data suggest that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) enhances the antileukemic activity of imatinib. We therefore examined combined imatinib and low-dose IFN-alpha in six patients with Ph+ALL who were ineligible for stem cell transplantation. All patients had received imatinib for 0.5-4.8 months prior to IFN-alpha, for relapsed (n=3) or refractory (n=1) Ph+ALL or as an alternative to chemotherapy following severe treatment-related toxicity (n=2). Five patients were in hematologic remission (CR) with minimal residual disease (MRD+), one patient was refractory to imatinib. Four of the five MRD+ patients are alive in CR after a median treatment duration of 20 (11-21) months. Two of these patients are in continuous CR 21 months after imatinib was initiated, while the other two patients experienced an isolated meningeal relapse that was successfully treated with additional intrathecal chemotherapy. Sustained molecular remissions were achieved in three patients and are ongoing 13 and 10.5 months after central nervous system (CNS) relapse and 6 months after starting concurrent IFN-alpha and imatinib, respectively. Marrow relapse occurred in one of the five MRD+ patients. Combination treatment was associated with a complete marrow response of 5 months duration in the imatinib-refractory patient. Imatinib combined with low-dose IFN-alpha may achieve prolonged hematologic and molecular remissions in a subset of patients with advanced Ph+ALL, who are not candidates for allogeneic SCT.

Many of the currently circulating strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are recombinants. Recombination can also accelerate the generation of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and therefore presents challenges to effective antiviral therapy. In this study, we determined that HIV-1 recombination rates with markers 1.0, 1.3, and 1.9 kb apart were 42.4, 50.4, and 47.4% in one round of viral replication. Because the predicted recombination rate of two unlinked markers is 50%, we conclude that markers 1 kb apart segregated in a manner similar to that for two unlinked markers in one round of retroviral replication. These recombination rates are exceedingly high even among retroviruses. Recombination rates of markers separated by 1 kb are 4 and 4.7% in one round of spleen necrosis virus and murine leukemia virus replication, respectively. Therefore, HIV-1 recombination can be 10-fold higher than that of other retroviruses. Recombination can be observed only in the proviruses derived from heterozygous virions that contain two genotypically different RNAs. The high rates of HIV-1 recombination observed in our studies also indicate that heterozygous virions are formed efficiently during HIV-1 replication and most HIV-1 virions are capable of undergoing recombination. Our results demonstrate that recombination is an effective mechanism to break the genetic linkage between neighboring sequences, thereby reassorting the HIV-1 genome and increasing the diversity in the viral population.","['Rhodes, Terence', 'Wargo, Heather', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Rhodes T', 'Wargo H', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.20.11193-11200.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Oct;77(20):11193-200. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.20.11193-11200.2003.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Markers', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Virion/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC224990,,,

There is presently little information available regarding the nature of extracellular stimuli that can transactivate the regulatory elements of HTLV-1 (i.e., long terminal repeat [LTR]). To gain insight into the biological importance of externally induced activation pathways in virus gene expression, primary and established T cells were transfected with HTLV-1-based reporter gene vectors and then were treated with agents that cross-linked the T-cell receptor (TCR) or the costimulatory CD28 molecule with prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). We demonstrated that a potent induction of HTLV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity was seen only when the three agents were used in combination. Interestingly, similar observations were made when using C91/PL, a cell line that carries integrated HTLV-1 proviral DNA. This TCR-CD28-PGE(2)-mediated increase in virus transcription was dependent on protein kinase A activation and induction of the cAMP response element binding protein. Experiments with a mutated reporter construct further revealed the importance of the Tax-responsive elements in the HTLV-1 LTR in the observed up regulation of virus gene expression when TCR/CD28 engagement was combined with PGE(2) treatment. The protein tyrosine kinases p56(lck) and the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 were all found to be involved in TCR-CD28-PGE(2)-directed increase in HTLV-1 LTR activity.

The early virus-cell interactions that determine a productive infection remain unclear. However, it is well recognized that T-cell activation is required for effective retroviral integration into the host cell genome and subsequent viral replication. The HTLV-1 pX open reading frame I encoding protein, p12(I), is critical for the virus to establish persistent infection in vivo and for infection in quiescent primary lymphocytes in vitro. p12(I) localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi apparatus, increases intracellular calcium and activates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-mediated transcription. To clarify the function of p12(I), we tested the production of IL-2 from Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) expressing p12(I). Lentiviral vector expressed p12(I) in Jurkat T cells enhanced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in a calcium pathway-dependent manner during T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Expression of p12(I) also induced higher NFAT-mediated reporter gene activities during TCR stimulation in Jurkat T cells. In contrast, p12 expression in PBMC elicited increased IL-2 production in the presence of phorbal ester stimulation, but not during TCR stimulation. Finally, the requirement of ER localization for p12(I)-mediated NFAT activation was demonstrated and two positive regions and two negative regions in p12(I) were identified for the activation of this transcription factor by using p12(I) truncation mutants. These results are the first to indicate that HTLV-1, an etiologic agent associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, uses a conserved accessory protein to induce T-cell activation, an antecedent to efficient viral infection.","['Ding, Wei', 'Kim, Seung-Jae', 'Nair, Amrithraj M', 'Michael, Bindhu', 'Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen', 'Tripp, Adam', 'Feuer, Gerold', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Ding W', 'Kim SJ', 'Nair AM', 'Michael B', 'Boris-Lawrie K', 'Tripp A', 'Feuer G', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Arthur G.

It is unclear how receptor binding induces conformational changes within the surface envelope protein (SU) that activate the fusion machinery residing in the transmembrane envelope protein (TM). In this report, we have isolated a point mutation, Q252R, within the proline-rich region of the 4070A murine leukemia virus SU that altered the virus-cell binding characteristics and induced cell-cell fusion. Q252R displays a SU shedding-sensitive phenotype. Cell-cell fusion is receptor dependent and is observed only in the presence of MuLV Gag-Pol. Both cellular binding and fusion by Q252R are greatly enhanced in conjunction of G100R, a mutation within the SU variable region A which increases viral binding through an independent mechanism. Deletion of a conserved histidine (His36) at the SU N terminus abolished cell-cell fusion by G100R/Q252R Env without compromising virus-cell binding. Although G100R/Q252R virus has no detectable titer, replacement of the N-terminal nine 4070A SU amino acids with the equivalent ecotropic MuLV sequence restored viral infectivity.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptors are expressed in human pituitary cells and murine hypothalamus and pituitary. LIF potently induces pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcription and ACTH secretion and potentiates CRH induction of POMC. In vivo, LIF, along with CRH, enhances POMC expression and ACTH secretion in response to emotional and inflammatory stress. To further elucidate specific roles for both CRH and LIF in activating the inflammatory HPA response, double-knockout mice (CRH/LIFKO) were generated by breeding the null mutants for each respective single gene. Inflammation produced by ip injection of lipopolysaccharide (1 microg/mouse) to double CRH and LIF-deficient mice elicited pituitary POMC induction similar to wild type and markedly higher than in single null animals (P<0.0.01). Double-knockout mice also demonstrated robust corticosterone response to inflammation. High pituitary POMC mRNA levels may reflect abundant TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 activation observed in the hypothalamus and pituitary of these animals. Our results suggest that increased central proinflammatory cytokine expression can compensate for the impaired HPA axis function and activates inflammatory ACTH and corticosterone responses in mice-deficient in both CRH and LIF.","['Kariagina, Anastasia', 'Romanenko, Dmitry', 'Ren, Song-Guang', 'Chesnokova, Vera']","['Kariagina A', 'Romanenko D', 'Ren SG', 'Chesnokova V']","['Cedars-Sinai Medical Center-University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,2003/09/27 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/en.2003-0669 [doi]', 'en.2003-0669 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2004 Jan;145(1):104-12. doi: 10.1210/en.2003-0669.

The CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the gp91PHOX and p67PHOX proteins, are two such HoxA10-Pbx1a target genes. In previous studies, we found that HoxA10-Pbx1a represses transcription of these genes by two mechanisms: competition for DNA binding with transcriptional activators and endogenous repression activity. In these studies, we identify a novel molecular mechanism of endogenous transcriptional repression by HoxA10-Pbx1a. Endogenous repression activity of other Hox-Pbx1a complexes requires recruitment of transcriptional co-repressor proteins by Pbx1a. In contrast, our investigations have determined that HoxA10 has Pbx1a-independent endogenous repression activity. We find that this transcriptional repression activity is abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting involvement of co-repressor proteins. Consistent with this, we identify HoxA10 amino acids 224-249 as a Pbx1-independent repression domain, which interacts with histone deacetylase 2. We have determined that this HoxA10 domain is not conserved with other Abd Hox proteins, although homology exists with other transcription factors and co-repressors. Understanding the roles different Hox proteins play in myeloid differentiation is a challenging problem. Our results suggest that insight into this problem can be obtained from biochemical characterization of the various molecular mechanisms of Hox protein function.","['Lu, YuFeng', 'Goldenberg, Inna', 'Bei, Ling', 'Andrejic, Jelena', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Lu Y', 'Goldenberg I', 'Bei L', 'Andrejic J', 'Eklund EA']","['Fineberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

Historically, T-ALL patients have had a worse prognosis than other ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the outcomes of 125 patients with T-ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium trials between 1981 and 1995. Therapy included four- or five-agent remission induction; consolidation therapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, corticosteroid, mercaptopurine, and weekly high-dose asparaginase; and cranial radiation. T-ALL patients were treated the same as high-risk B-progenitor ALL patients. Fifteen patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma were also treated with the same high-risk regimen between 1981 and 2000. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for T-ALL patients was 75% +/- 4%. Fourteen of 15 patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma were long-term survivors. There was no significant difference in EFS comparing patients with T-ALL and B-progenitor ALL (P =.56), although T-ALL patients had significantly higher rates of induction failure (P <.0001), and central nervous system (CNS) relapse (P =.02). The median time to relapse in T-ALL patients was 1.2 years versus 2.5 years in B-progenitor ALL patients (P =.001). There were no pretreatment characteristics associated with worse prognosis in patients with T-ALL. CONCLUSION: T-ALL patients fared as well as B-progenitor patients on DFCI ALL Consortium protocols. Patients with T-ALL remain at increased risk for induction failure, early relapse, and isolated CNS relapse. Future studies should focus on the identification of and treatment for T-ALL patients at high risk for treatment failure.","['Goldberg, John M', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Levy, Donna E', 'Dalton, Virginia Kimball', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Lehmann, Leslie', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Asselin, Barbara L']","['Goldberg JM', 'Silverman LB', 'Levy DE', 'Dalton VK', 'Gelber RD', 'Lehmann L', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Asselin BL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/22 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.10.116 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.10.116 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Oct 1;21(19):3616-22. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.10.116.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']","['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since arsenic can prolong the QT interval and lead to torsade de pointes, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, this retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the degree of QT prolongation in patients treated with arsenic trioxide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and serial ECGs from 99 patients with advanced malignancies who received 170 courses of arsenic trioxide in either a phase I or phase II investigational study were reviewed. RESULTS: Prolonged QT intervals developed in 38 patients (26 patients had intervals >/= 500 milliseconds). Compared with baseline, the heart rate-corrected (QTc) interval was prolonged by 30 to 60 milliseconds in 36.6% of treatment courses, and by more than 60 milliseconds in 35.4% of patients. The degree of prolongation was higher in men than in women during the first course of therapy, and in patients with hypokalemia. In patients receiving multiple courses, QTc intervals returned to pretreatment levels before the second course, signifying that arsenic trioxide does not permanently prolong the QTc interval. One hypokalemic, arsenic trioxide-treated patient with relapsed APL developed asymptomatic torsade de pointes, which resolved spontaneously and did not recur after electrolyte replacement. There were no sudden or arrhythmia-related deaths. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that arsenic trioxide can prolong the QTc interval. However, with appropriate ECG monitoring and management of electrolytes and concomitant medications, arsenic trioxide can be safely administered in patients with relapsed APL.","['Barbey, Jean T', 'Pezzullo, John C', 'Soignet, Steven L']","['Barbey JT', 'Pezzullo JC', 'Soignet SL']","['Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, 3900 Reservoir Rd, NW, MedDent Building, C 305, Washington, DC 20007, USA. tczjb@aol.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/10/22 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.10.009 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.10.009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Oct 1;21(19):3609-15. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.10.009.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Long QT Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Torsades de Pointes/*chemically induced']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GATA-1 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and is essential for proper development of erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. Although loss of GATA-1 leads to differentiation arrest and apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, absence of GATA-1 promotes accumulation of immature megakaryocytes. Recently, we and others have reported that mutagenesis of GATA1 is an early event in Down syndrome (DS) leukemogenesis. Acquired mutations in GATA1 were detected in the vast majority of patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL) and in nearly every patient with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), a ""preleukemia"" that may be present in as many as 10% of infants with DS. Although the precise pathway by which mutagenesis of GATA1 contributes to leukemia is unknown, these findings confirm that GATA1 plays an important role in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Future studies to define the mechanism that results in the high frequency of GATA1 mutations in DS and the role of altered GATA1 in TMD and DS-AMKL will shed light on the multistep pathway in human leukemia and may lead to an increased understanding of why children with DS are markedly predisposed to leukemia.","['Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Crispino, John D']","['Gurbuxani S', 'Vyas P', 'Crispino JD']","['University of Chicago, 924 E 57th St, Rm R116, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/27 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-05-1556 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54616-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jan 15;103(2):399-406. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1556.

Men who have undergone sex-mismatched allogeneic HSCT are at high risk for GVHD because of immune responses directed against mHAs encoded by genes on the Y chromosome (termed H-Y antigens). We hypothesized that the immunogenicity of mHAs results in a coordinated response involving B cells as well as T cells. To test this, we measured antibody responses to a well-characterized H-Y antigen, dead box RNA helicase Y (DBY), and its homolog, DBX, in 150 HSCT patients. Using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found that 50% of male patients who received stem cell grafts from female donors developed antibody responses to recombinant DBY protein. Antibodies to DBY were also detected in 17% of healthy women, but not in healthy men. Antibody responses were directed primarily against areas of amino acid disparity between DBY and DBX.

Here, we describe novel associations between donor T-cell cytokine production during donor-antipatient mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). The data reveal positive correlations between both Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine production and GVHD and the assay established could potentially represent a useful tool for identification of permissible unrelated SCT donors. Associations between interleukin 13 (IL-13) levels and aGVHD were by far the strongest predictor of a GVHD (P =.0002). All patients suffering severe (grade III) aGVHD following SCT had donors who produced very high pretransplantation IL-13 responses, while those developing little or no aGVHD (grades 0-I) produced no IL-13 at all. IL-13 levels were independent of all other cytokines measured as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) frequencies. The cytokines IL-5, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) also predicted development of aGVHD (P <.05 for all 3), appearing to be coproduced in the assay and correlating with estimated CTLp frequencies. The data challenge the notion that aGVHD is purely a Th1-type cytokine-driven response, high-lighting a novel and highly significant link between the Th2-type cytokine IL-13 and aGVHD.","['Jordan, William J', 'Brookes, Paul A', 'Szydlo, Richard M', 'Goldman, John M', 'Lechler, Robert I', 'Ritter, Mary A']","['Jordan WJ', 'Brookes PA', 'Szydlo RM', 'Goldman JM', 'Lechler RI', 'Ritter MA']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom. w.jordan1@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/27 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0192 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54663-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jan 15;103(2):717-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0192.

We examined the interaction between two cytokine families, gp130-related cytokines and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which are coexpressed in the nervous system during acute trauma and pathological conditions. Typical nerve cells show an IFN-gamma response that is restricted to activating STAT1, with minor activation of STAT3. IFN-gamma elicited a pronounced STAT3 response in cells pre-treated for 5-7 h with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor or interleukin-6. CNTF or interleukin-6 induced an IFN-gamma STAT3 response in a variety of cells including SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma, HMN-1 murine motor neuron hybrid cells, rat sympathetic neurons and human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The enhancement was measured as an increase in tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3, in STAT3-DNA binding and in STAT-luciferase reporter gene activity. The enhanced STAT3 response was not due to an increase in overall STAT3 levels but was dependent upon ongoing protein synthesis. The induction by CNTF was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, BIM, and the MAPK-kinase inhibitor, U0126. Further, H-35 hepatoma cells expressing gp130 receptor chimeras lacking either the SHP-2 docking site or the Box 3 STAT binding sites failed to enhance the IFN-gamma STAT3 response.

To characterize further how this widely distributed molecule is regulated differentially in each tissue, we analysed the major type 2 CD10/NEP promoter and found three functionally important transcription factor binding sites, one of which was identical to CCAAT-binding transcription factor/nuclear transcription factor Y. In this report, we analyse the type 1 CD10/NEP promoter and found a functionally important transcription factor binding site in the 5'-untranslated region.

The mechanism involved in the development of PRCA in T-GLPD is unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 patients with T-GLPD. Ten patients had associated PRCA. Granular lymphocytes (GLs) of T-GLPD are positive for CD94, but not NKG2A. To clarify the functional role of CD94 in T-GLPD, we performed a cytotoxicity assay against the trophoblast cell line, BeWo, which is known to express human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a natural ligand of CD94, and is deficient in other HLA class I and class II antigens. GLs isolated from T-GLPD with PRCA patients killed BeWo cells more significantly than GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA patients. Furthermore, GLs from T-GLPD with PRCA were significantly stimulated by a monoclonal antibody against CD94, whereas those of T-GLPD without PRCA were not. Taken together, HLA-E, a ligand of CD94, was suggested to stimulate CD94+ cells to kill HLA-E+ cells in T-GLPD with PRCA. GLs of T-GLPD with PRCA have a potential positive activity against HLA-E+ cells, whereas GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA do not. CD94 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PRCA in T-GLPD.","['Mori, Kiyoshi L', 'Furukawa, Hisae', 'Hayashi, Keiko', 'Sugimoto, Kei-Ji J', 'Oshimi, Kazuo']","['Mori KL', 'Furukawa H', 'Hayashi K', 'Sugimoto KJ', 'Oshimi K']","['Department of Haematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. klmori@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['4553 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04553.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(1):147-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04553.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the recovery of phenotype and function of moDCs after myeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT) was prompt, there was a trend to a lower expression of co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility antigen class II antigens on mature moDCs in patients who had received RIC transplants. Similarly, the allostimulatory capacity of mature moDCs after RIC transplants was reduced for up to 6 months. Six out of 14 (43%) RIC transplant patients showed a pattern of mixed chimaerism within the first 3 months after transplant. RIC transplant patients with a mixed donor DC chimaerism had a significantly higher risk of relapse (75% versus 35% for patients with full donor DC chimaerism, P = 0.03) but a lower incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (25% versus 56% for patients with full donor DC chimaerism, P = 0.157). These data, although preliminary, provide evidence that DC function is impaired after RIC transplants and that DC chimaerism may have an impact on graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukaemia reactions.","['Nachbaur, David', 'Kircher, Brigitte', 'Eisendle, Klaus', 'Latzer, Karla', 'Haun, Margot', 'Gastl, Gunther']","['Nachbaur D', 'Kircher B', 'Eisendle K', 'Latzer K', 'Haun M', 'Gastl G']","['BMT Unit and Tumour- and Immunobiology Laboratory, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria. david.nachbaur@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['4588 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04588.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(1):119-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04588.x.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chimera', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Middle Aged', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to investigate whether the IPSS could be used as a prognostic tool in MDS patients aged less than 61 years who were treated with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-like chemotherapy with or without transplantation, and whether the scoring system discriminated between the subgroups of patients who benefit from intensive treatment strategies. The patients were retrospectively assigned to the IPSS risk categories and compared with the IPSS workshop patients. Eighty-three of 159 patients aged < 61 years, classified as intermediate 1, intermediate 2 and high risk according to the IPSS, received intensive treatment consisting of chemotherapy only (n = 30), chemotherapy followed by either autologous stem cell transplantation (n = 7) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 46). After intensive treatment, the median survival was 2.6 years for the intermediate 1 risk group (n = 33), 3.4 years for the intermediate 2 risk group (n = 27) and 0.9 years for the high-risk group (n = 23). We conclude that the IPSS is an improved scoring system for patients receiving supportive care. Nevertheless, the scoring system does not seem to be the best method for predicting outcome after intensive antileukaemic treatment. In particular, intermediate 2 risk patients may benefit from intensive treatment.","['Oosterveld, Margriet', 'Wittebol, Shulamiet H', 'Lemmens, Wim A J G', 'Kiemeney, Bart A L M', 'Catik, Ashuman', 'Muus, Petra', 'Schattenberg, Anton V M B', 'de Witte, Theo J M']","['Oosterveld M', 'Wittebol SH', 'Lemmens WA', 'Kiemeney BA', 'Catik A', 'Muus P', 'Schattenberg AV', 'de Witte TJ']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Human cyclin A1 was cloned as an A-type cyclin that is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The clinical significance of these cyclins in myeloid leukaemia remains to be clarified. We investigated the relative levels of these transcripts in 80 patients with de novo AML. Correlations with clinical parameters showed that the initial white blood cell count and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were inversely associated with cyclin A (A2) mRNA levels (r = -0.276, P = 0.019) and cyclin A1 mRNA levels (r = -0.241, P = 0.042) respectively. They were independently associated with increased overall survival [P = 0.035 for cyclin A (A2) and P = 0.016 for cyclin A1]. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that elevated cyclin A1 mRNA levels contributed significantly to the better prognosis of patients with AML. Furthermore, the analysis of survival probability showed that the group with high levels of both cyclin A (A2) and A1 survived significantly longer than the group with low expression of both these cyclins (P = 0.002). These data indicate that high expression levels of both cyclin A (A2) and A1 are associated with good prognosis in AML patients.","['Nakamaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Hamano, Yasuharu', 'Hisatake, Jun-Ichi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiro', 'Kawakami, Kei-Ichiro', 'Tomoyasu, Shigeru', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Koeffler, Phillip']","['Nakamaki T', 'Hamano Y', 'Hisatake J', 'Yokoyama A', 'Kawakami K', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Honma Y', 'Koeffler P']","['Department of Haematology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Centre Research Institute, Saitama, Japan. nakamaki@med.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['4569 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04569.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(1):72-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04569.x.,"['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Cyclin A/*genetics', 'Cyclin A1', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 910 children were included, all of whom had histologically and/or cytologically verified leukaemia or lymphoma. At the time of their diagnoses, all the children were aged 0-14 years and were resident in the counties of Greater Manchester or Lancashire. Standardized morbidity ratios were calculated. Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between incidence rates and small-area (census ward) population density, ethnic composition and deprivation index. There was a monotonic relationship between acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) incidence and population density (P = 0.05). Higher rates were seen in more densely populated areas. There was evidence for a monotonic relationship between the incidence of the mixed cellularity subtype of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and the Townsend deprivation score (P = 0.001).

Quantitative analysis of WT1 transcript at presentation in 66 patients (52 AML, 14 ALL) correlated significantly with remission rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). WT1 levels were normalized to 105ABL transcripts. Within good and standard cytogenetic risk groups, high WT1 levels correlated with poorer outcome. Serial quantification was performed in 35 patients (28 AML, seven ALL); those with less than 103 copies of WT1 after induction and second consolidation chemotherapy had significantly better DFS and OS. Fourteen patients have relapsed with a median complete remission duration of 12 (range 4-49) months. We detected a rise in WT1 levels in nine out of 14 patients, 2-4 months before the onset of haematological relapse, whereas in the remaining five patients, WT1 levels remained persistently high during the disease course. WT1 levels were lower in PB than in BM, but mirrored changes in the BM samples and were equally informative.

Genetic variants in the coding regions of the mismatch repair genes MLH1 (Ile-219Val) and MSH3 (Arg-940Glu and Thr-1036Ala) could contribute to an individual's susceptibility as modifiers in leukaemogenesis. To investigate this possibility, we conducted a case-control study on 287 children with ALL and 320 healthy controls both of French-Canadian origin. MLH1 and MSH3 variants, when taken independently, seemed to play little or no role in the aetiology of childhood ALL. However, when the MLH1 genotypes were combined with genotypes previously shown to influence ALL susceptibility, we found that the MLH1 variant Val-219 further increases the risk of GSTM1 null and CYP1A1*2A genotypes [combined odds ratio (OR) = 6.0, P = 0.002] as well as that of CYP2E1*5 (OR = 15.8, P = 0.001).

The mechanisms responsible for this are unknown, although loss of p53 has been reported in approximately 25% of cases. Elevated expression of Bcr-Abl is also associated with disease progression. We have shown that cells expressing high levels of Bcr-Abl also express elevated levels of p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor, p21WAF-1. Despite this, cells continue to cycle and are drug resistant. As p21WAF-1 inhibitory activity is associated with nuclear localization, we investigated its localization in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, and found that it is predominantly cytoplasmic. We have also shown that it associates physically with the serine/threonine kinase AKT, but this association and the cytosolic location of p21WAF-1 are phosphinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) independent. Cytosolic p21WAF-1 has been reported to have a prosurvival role in other transformed cells. In Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, p21WAF-1 rapidly diminishes as the cells are sensitized to apoptosis, using the inhibitor STI571.

This study suggests that, by retaining p21WAF-1 in a cytosolic location, Bcr-Abl can evade the cell cycle arrest normally induced by nuclear p21WAF-1 and therefore also enable the cells to negate an important feature of a tumour suppressor response.","['Keeshan, Karen', 'Cotter, Thomas G', 'McKenna, Sharon L']","['Keeshan K', 'Cotter TG', 'McKenna SL']","['Department of Pathology, Institute for Medicine and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2003/09/27 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['4538 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04538.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Oct;123(1):34-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04538.x.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Piperazines', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, both recombinant protein as well as a gene vaccine for Art v 1 failed to be immunogenic in mice. In order to improve immunogenicity we focused on genetic immunization because interspecific differences of codon usage have been shown as an obstacle for effective induction of immune responses with gene vaccines encoding infectious pathogens. OBJECTIVE: In order to find out, whether codon usage might also be used to improve genetic immunization with allergen genes, the response against a gene vaccine expressing the wild-type gene of Art v 1 (pCMV-wtArt) was compared with a synthetic codon-optimized vector with human codon usage (pCMV-humArt). METHODS: Balb/c mice were injected intradermally with pCMV-wtArt or pCMV-humArt. In vitro expression levels of both constructs were compared in transfection experiments. Total immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1, IgG2a and IgE antibodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the anaphylactic activity of the sera was determined by allergen-specific degranulation of rat basophil leukemia-2H3 cells. RESULTS: No immune response was detectable with the gene vaccine expressing the wildtype Art v 1, but immunization with pCMV-humArt revealed a strong and allergen-specific induction of antibody responses. The antibodies recognized both the recombinant as well as the purified natural (glycosylated) Art v 1 molecule. The response type was Th1-biased, as indicated by high levels of IgG2a antibodies. Expression analysis with B16 mouse melanoma cells transfected with pCMV-humArt or pCMV-wtArt revealed an impaired expression of the wild-type vector but normal translation after recoding. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that optimization of codon usage offers a simple way to improve immunogenicity and therefore should be routinely considered in the development of gene vaccines for the treatment of allergy.","['Bauer, R', 'Himly, M', 'Dedic, A', 'Ferreira, F', 'Thalhamer, J', 'Hartl, A']","['Bauer R', 'Himly M', 'Dedic A', 'Ferreira F', 'Thalhamer J', 'Hartl A']","['Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Immunology Group, University of Salzburg Institute of Genetics and General Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,2003/09/27 05:00,2004/02/19 05:00,['2003/09/27 05:00'],"['2003/09/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['170 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00170.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2003 Oct;58(10):1003-10. doi: 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00170.x.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Art v 1 protein, mugwort)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Allergens/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Codon', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that sex-related factors influence early virus replication via mechanisms involving a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the long terminal repeat (LTR) enhancer region. In the present study, we investigated further the influence of sex and steroid hormones on early murine retrovirus dissemination and immune functions. In male mice we found a correlation between an early expansion of the CD8+ cell subset and rapid infection of lymphocytes, including CD8+ cells. Virus load in blood declined faster in females than in males, and the postpeak declines coincided with more rapidly generation of antibodies against virus-positive cells. Moreover, female-derived T-cells responded better to in vitro mitogen stimuli than male-derived T-cells. Physiological concentrations of progesterone and dexamethasone induced a dose-dependent inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Administration of progestin in vivo did not modify early FIS-2 production in female mice. Male castrated mice, who were notably less involved in aggressive behaviour and fighting compared to male control mice, had a significant delay of virus dissemination. We suggest that testosterone-dependent aggression, with successive enhanced stress hormone levels, may influence both FIS-2 replication and immune responses during infection.","['Bruland, Torunn', 'Lavik, Liss Anne S', 'Dai, Hong Yan', 'Dalen, Are']","['Bruland T', 'Lavik LA', 'Dai HY', 'Dalen A']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

The human genome encodes two E-type cyclins (E and E2) and two A-type cyclins (A1 and A2). Dysregulation of the CDK2-bound cyclins plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Cyclin A2 is associated with cellular proliferation and can be used for molecular diagnostics as a proliferation marker. In addition, cyclin A2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancer. Cyclin A1 is a tissue-specific cyclin that is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and in testicular cancer. High levels of cyclin E expression are found in many types of cancer. Overexpression of cyclin E at the mRNA level can be based on gene amplification and transcriptional mechanisms. In addition, proteolytically cleaved forms of cyclin E that show oncogenic functions have been described. Cyclin E plays a critical role for G1/S transition. Its overexpression is not only associated with proliferation but rather indicates a more malignant phenotype which is likely to be linked to the induction of chromosomal instability. These biological functions of cyclin E relate to a poor prognosis when high cyclin E levels are found. The link between cyclin E and poor prognosis is well established in breast and lung cancer but is likely to be observed in other cancers as well. The second E-type cyclin, cyclin E2, has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancers although the potential role as a diagnostic or prognostic marker is unknown.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the benefit of adding imatinib to the treatment sequence of patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who received interferon alpha (IFN)-based regimens as frontline therapy. METHODS: A total of 201 patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who were treated on our 3 recent frontline IFN-based programs and were impacted early by the availability of sequential therapy with imatinib were analyzed. Their outcome was compared with that of a historical control group of 293 patients treated from 1982 until 1990 who were treated with IFN programs for early chronic phase CML and who did not have the opportunity of early access to imatinib (because it was not available during that period). Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the independent effect of imatinib therapy on survival. RESULTS: Of 201 patients who were treated, 159 patients (79%) had their regimen changed sequentially to imatinib after a median duration of 14 months of IFN therapy. Of 139 patients who continued evaluation at our institution, 101 patients (73%; 64% of the total group) achieved a complete cytogenetic response, and 20 of 80 patients analyzed (25%; 10% of the total group) had no disease according to molecular studies (quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies). The estimated 5-year survival rate for the total study group of 201 patients was 86%. Survival of this group was significantly superior to the historic control group of IFN-treated patients who did not have the benefit of imatinib (P = 0.03). The trend also was observed within defined CML risk groups. Imatinib therapy was confirmed as an independent, significant, favorable prognostic factor for survival by multivariate analysis, after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment prognostic factors (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis is the first to indicate the independent, favorable effect of imatinib on the survival of patients with Ph-positive CML.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorges', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Giles, Francis', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Shan J', 'Giles F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Faderl S', 'Rios MB', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

This has translated into the recognition of several subgroups of ALL and the institution of risk-adapted therapies. New therapies are emerging based on the definition of specific cytogenetic-molecular abnormalities. METHODS: A review from the English literature, including original articles and related reviews from Medline (Pubmed) and abstracts based on publication of meeting material, was performed. RESULTS: Changes in the pathologic classification of ALL have led to therapeutic consequences. Adaptation of successful treatment strategies in children with ALL has resulted in similar complete response rates in adults. Prognosis has especially improved in mature-B-cell and T-lineage ALL. The role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL was evaluated in the current study. However, regardless of the ALL subgroup, long-term survival of adults is still inferior to that in children. CONCLUSIONS: Intense clinical and laboratory research is attempting to close the gap in outcome between children and adults with ALL. Investigations are focusing on 1) refinement of the basic treatment stratagem of induction, consolidation, and maintenance; 2) expansion of risk-based, subgroup-oriented therapies; 3) assessment of minimal residual disease, its impact on disease recurrence, and its practical implications in clinical practice; 4) salvage strategies; 5) the role of stem cell transplantation in ALL; and 6) the development of new drugs based on a better understanding of disease biology.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Jeha S', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Unusual reports of aggressive lymphoma presenting with both translocations have been described as well as rare cases with a third structural alteration usually involving BCL6. The patient described here presented with aggressive high-grade lymphocytic leukemia, FAB subtype L2 (ALL-L2), and three reciprocal translocations, t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), and t(1;2) (q22-23;p13). Despite immature morphology the leukemic blasts had a mature B-cell phenotype; they were positive for surface immunoglobulin heavy chains and negative for CD34, TdT, and CD10. Most reported dual t(14;18)/t(8;14) cases have not shown sIg and were positive for CD10. Molecular genetic analyses showed the typical rearrangements of BCL2 and cMYC as well as the FCGR2B gene on chromosome 1q23. The occurrence of a third oncogene rearrangement in association with the dual BCL2, cMYC translocations in ALL patients is very rare. To our knowledge, this is the first case where the third hit involves the FCGR2B locus. This report reiterates the poor prognosis associated with activation of cMYC together with elevated Bcl-2 expression. These data also support recent evidence that dysregulation of FCGR2B may play a role in tumor progression.","['Greer, Wenda L', 'Lee, Christine L Y', 'Callanan, Mary B', 'Zayed, Ekram', 'Sadek, Irene']","['Greer WL', 'Lee CL', 'Callanan MB', 'Zayed E', 'Sadek I']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. wenda.greer@cdha.nshealth.ca']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,2003/09/26 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10393 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Oct;74(2):112-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10393.,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Biology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', '*Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss Inc.'],,,,,,

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Normal platelet count in pregnancy is 250-290 x 10(9)/l, Thrombocytopaenia in pregnancy may be defined as platelet counts below 150 x 10(9)/l. Benign gestational thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 70-150 x 10(9)/l without clinical findings or any maternal or fetal risk) develops in 5%-12% of all pregnancies in the third trimester. Immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) occurs in about one or two out of 1000 pregnancies and may be complicated by fetal alloimmune thrombocytopaenia. Thrombocytopaenia is present in nearly half of the cases with preeclampsia. The HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count) is classified according to platelet counts.

The Dbl homology domain of Bcr, activating Rho GTPases, is present in p210(bcr-abl), but absent in p190(bcr-abl). We investigated the interaction of Bcr-Abl chimeras and Rho proteins by coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments and GEF activity measurement. RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 interact in vivo with p210(bcr-abl) only. Moreover, the three types of GTPases are activated in vitro and in vivo by p210(bcr-abl). Nevertheless, Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, are activated by p190(bcr-abl) in vitro and in vivo. Part of this GEF activity of p190(bcr-abl) is probably attributable to p95(vav), which is complexed with both p190(bcr-abl) and p210(bcr-abl) in an activated form. p160(bcr), also in complex with Bcr-Abl, presents no GEF activity in p190(bcr-abl)-expressing cells.

U937 cells were transduced using a retrovirus carrying NPM-RARalpha. While treatment with the synthetic PPARgamma ligand troglitazone (TG) had no effect on the viability of U937 cells, TG treatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability, dependent upon both the concentration of TG and the level of expression of NPM-RARalpha. Analysis of the cell cycle profile and flow cytometry with annexin V confirmed that these effects of TG were due to induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation, and could be blocked by treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Cotreatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) abrogated the induction of apoptosis by TG. Induction of apoptosis was seen also in the PML-RARalpha-expressing APL cell line NB4, and in several other atRA-sensitive leukemia cell lines, demonstrating that this effect is limited neither to the monocyte lineage nor to the rare NPM-RARalpha fusion variant. RXRalpha/NPM-RARalpha heterodimers were found to interact directly with a PPARgamma-responsive element in vitro. We conclude that in the presence of X-RARalpha, TG induces cell death due to apoptosis via the caspase pathway.

Based on immunophenotyping and cell lineage, cases were classified into B-cell type (CD20,CD19 or CD79a+, n = 53), T-cell type (surface CD3+, n = 84), and non-B, non-T type (B cell marker- and surface CD3-, n = 21). The latter group was further divided based on immunohistochemistry into: 1) CD7+ stem cell lymphoma (CD7+SCL) [CD4-, CD7+, CD33+/-, CD56-], 2) blastic natural killer cell lymphoma (B-NKL) [CD4-, CD7+/-, CD33-, CD56+, CD123-], 3) myeloid/NK precursor cell leukemia (M/NKL) [CD4-, CD7+, CD33+, CD56+], and 4) CD4+CD56+ hematodermic malignancy (CD4+CD56+) type [CD4+, CD7+/-, CD33-, CD56+, CD123+]. The CD7+SCL and M/NKL types frequently exhibited bone marrow invasion and mediastinal masses. All CD4+CD56+ types were associated with skin lesions. B-NKL type is included into Blastic NK lymphoma in new World Health Organization classification with CD4+CD56+ type. But the cases of B-NKL were more reminiscent of CD7+SCL or M/NKL type than the CD4+CD56+ type, both clinically and histologically. We propose that blastic NK lymphoma, a disease entity in the new WHO classification, should be divided into two types based on phenotypes and clinical features. The non-B, non-T lymphomas exhibited poorer prognoses, similar to that of B-cell lymphomas, than T-cell type tumors (P = 0.009). Among the 21 tumors, the prognosis of the four subtypes did not differ significantly; however, cases receiving aggressive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation had a more favorable prognosis than those receiving only traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy (P = 0.0089).","['Karube, Kennosuke', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Tsuchiya, Takeshi', 'Yamaguchi, Takahiro', 'Suefuji, Hiroaki', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Harada, Mine', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Karube K', 'Ohshima K', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Suefuji H', 'Suzumiya J', 'Harada M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. xs255@cis.fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,2003/09/26 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200310000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2003 Oct;27(10):1366-74. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200310000-00009.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,['Am J Surg Pathol. 2004 Jun;28(6):835-7; author reply 837.

The effective prevention and intervention remained largely complex and unclear. In a cell model of human leukemia THP-1 monocytes following bacterial endotoxin (LPS) exposure, we show the novel anticoagulant ability of polyamino acid (polyAA) to suppress the extrinsic hypercoagulation. LPS-induced monocytic tissue factor (mTF) procoagulation was readily offset by poly-L-lysine (PLK), poly-L-arginine (PLR), or poly-L-ornithine (POR) included in single-stage clotting assays. IC50 was estimated at 0.35, 0.30, or 0.58 microM for PLR, POR, or PLK, respectively, whereas, poly-L-asparatic acid (PLD) remained ineffective. In a separate approach, inclusion of cationic polyAA in human plasma significantly prolonged prothrombin time, confirming the depressed extrinsic coagulation. In chromogenic assays dissecting the extrinsic pathway, we further determined the inhibitory site(s). PLK, PLR, or POR significantly inhibited LPS-induced FVII activation, which was consistent with the diminished FVIIa formation shown on Western blotting analysis. In contrast, polyAA did not show any additional effect on either FVIIa/FXa amidolytic activities or mTF/FVIIa-catalyzed FX activation. Nor did polyAA show any effect on FVII activation directly catalyzed by FXa. Taken together, PLK, PLR, or POR preferentially inhibited mTF-dependent FVII activation, accounting for their novel anticoagulant activities. PolyAA might present the specific antagonists to arrest the extrinsic hypercoagulation following inflammation.","['Chu, Arthur J', 'Rauci, Mihai', 'Nwobi, Obioma I', 'Mathews, Suresh T', 'Beydoun, Salwa']","['Chu AJ', 'Rauci M', 'Nwobi OI', 'Mathews ST', 'Beydoun S']","['Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. ajchu91@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,7902492,2003/09/26 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005344-200310000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2003 Oct;42(4):477-83. doi: 10.1097/00005344-200310000-00004.,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Peptides)', '25104-12-5 (polyornithine)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '25212-18-4 (polyarginine)', '26063-13-8 (polyaspartate)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Factor VII/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Factor Xa/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/adverse effects/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Monocytes/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Polylysine/pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cancer therapeutic and chemopreventive agents exert anti-proliferative, differentiation-inducing, pro-apoptotic and other biological effects. The retinoids act through nuclear retinoid receptors to activate target genes that signal retinoid biological effects. Direct retinoid targets contain retinoid responsive elements in their promoters, are directly regulated by retinoids and reproduce retinoid biological effects once introduced into a responsive cell context. Through studies conducted in in vitro models, a proteolytic mechanism was linked to retinoid induced tumor cell differentiation and chemopreventive effects. Retinoid treatments can activate the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) can also trigger degradation of the oncogenic protein, PML-RARalpha. Microarray analysis revealed involvement of an E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme, UBE1L, in this induction. Retinoid chemopreventive activity in human bronchial epithelial cells was linked to triggering of G(1) cell cycle arrest, concomitant growth suppression, and a decline in expression of G(1) cyclins. This can engage proteasome-dependent cyclin degradation, causing G(1) arrest and this permits repair of genomic DNA damage. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also identified as a retinoid target. Retinoids exert diverse biological effects. Different retinoid target genes likely trigger distinct effects. Identification of target genes is the next step towards a molecular understanding of mechanisms of retinoid response or resistance in cancer therapy and chemoprevention.","['Dragnev, Konstantin H', 'Petty, W Jeffrey', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Dragnev KH', 'Petty WJ', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA. dragnev@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,2003/09/26 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['215 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2003 Jul-Aug;2(4 Suppl 1):S150-6.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/therapy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retinoids/*metabolism']","['R01-CA62275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA87546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,106,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDM2 binding inhibits p53 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome, whereas promyelocytic leukemia (PML) activates p53 by recruiting it to multiprotein complexes termed PML-nuclear bodies. We reported previously an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 that is independent of p53. In the current study, we investigated whether interaction between MDM2 and PML can indirectly affect p53 activity. Increasing amounts of MDM2 inhibited p53 activation by PML but could not inhibit PML-mediated activation of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the MDM2-binding domain. Conversely, increasing amounts of PML could overcome p53 inhibition by MDM2 but could not overcome MDM2-mediated inhibition of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the PML-binding domain. These results demonstrate that MDM2 and PML can antagonize each other through their direct interaction with p53 and suggest the combined effects of MDM2 and PML on p53 function are determined by the relative level of each protein. Furthermore, these results imply that interactions between MDM2 and PML by themselves have little or no effect on p53 activity.","['Zhu, Hongyan', 'Wu, Liqing', 'Maki, Carl G']","['Zhu H', 'Wu L', 'Maki CG']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/09/26 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M308302200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75704-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 5;278(49):49286-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M308302200.

At E8-E9, the embryonic body from the umbilicus caudalwards was also analysed. Fetal liver was analysed beginning on E10. At E8, between five and nine somite pairs (sp), placenta, yolk sac and embryonic body yielded no progenitors. The first progenitors appeared at E8.5 at the stage of 15 sp in the yolk sac, 18 sp in the embryonic body, 20 sp in the placenta and only at E12 in the fetal liver (absent at E10, at E11 not determined). Progenitors with a high proliferation potential that could be replated for two months, as well as the whole range of myeloid progenitors, were found at all stages in all organs. However, the earliest of these progenitors (these yielding large, multilineage colonies) were 2-4 times more frequent in the placenta than in the yolk sac or fetal liver. In the fetal liver, late progenitors were more frequent and the cellularity increased steeply with developmental age. Thus, the fetal liver, which is a recognized site for amplification and commitment, has a very different hematopoietic developmental profile from placenta or yolk sac. Placentas were obtained from GFP transgenic embryos in which only the embryonic contribution expressed the transgene. 80% of the colonies derived from these placental cells were GFP+, and so originated from the fetal component of the placenta. These data point to the placenta as a major hematopoietic organ that is active during most of pregnancy.","['Alvarez-Silva, Marcio', 'Belo-Diabangouaya, Patricia', 'Salaun, Josselyne', 'Dieterlen-Lievre, Francoise']","['Alvarez-Silva M', 'Belo-Diabangouaya P', 'Salaun J', 'Dieterlen-Lievre F']","[""Laboratoire d'Embryologie cellulaire et moleculaire du CNRS et du College de France, 49 bis, avenue de la Belle Gabrielle, 94736 Nogent s/Marne cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,2003/09/26 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/dev.00755 [doi]', 'dev.00755 [pii]']",ppublish,Development. 2003 Nov;130(22):5437-44. doi: 10.1242/dev.00755.

However, photophysical studies of IFPs have been carried out mainly in aqueous solution. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the intracellular environmental effects on the steady-state spectroscopy and excited-state dynamics of green (EGFP) and red (DsRed) fluorescent proteins, using both one- and two-photon excitation. EGFP and DsRed are expressed either in the cytoplasm of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mucosal mast cells or anchored (via LynB protein) to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The fluorescence lifetimes (within approximately 10%) and spectra in live cells are basically the same as in aqueous solution, which indicate the absence of both IFP aggregation and cellular environmental effects on the protein folding under our experimental conditions. However, comparative time-resolved anisotropy measurements of EGFP reveal a cytoplasmic viscosity 2.5 +/- 0.3 times larger than that of aqueous solution at room temperature, and also provide some insights into the LynB-EGFP structure and the heterogeneity of the cytoplasmic viscosity. Further, the oligomer configuration and internal depolarization of DsRed, previously observed in solution, persists upon expression in these cells. DsRed also undergoes an instantaneous three-photon induced color change under 740-nm excitation, with efficiently nonradiative green species. These results confirm the implicit assumption that in vitro fluorescence properties of IFPs are essentially valid for in vivo applications, presumably due to the beta-barrel protection of the embodied chromophore. We also discuss the relevance of LynB-EGFP anisotropy for specialized domains studies in plasma membranes.","['Hess, Samuel T', 'Sheets, Erin D', 'Wagenknecht-Wiesner, Alice', 'Heikal, Ahmed A']","['Hess ST', 'Sheets ED', 'Wagenknecht-Wiesner A', 'Heikal AA']","['School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Nanobiotechnology Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,2003/09/26 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(03)74679-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74679-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2003 Oct;85(4):2566-80. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74679-7.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (fluorescent protein 583)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Luminescent Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton/methods', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']","['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI018306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08267/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008267/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '9-P41-EB0011976-16/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,PMC1303480,,,

The magnitude and nature of this bias were explored using data from a German case-control study on childhood leukemia conducted between 1992 and 1997. A moderate overreporting of occupational exposures by fathers was observed, particularly for the prenatal period. Overreporting was most apparent when the time between exposure and interview was short. It was also found that job titles were no satisfactory substitute for information on specific occupational exposures. The results of this analysis emphasize the need for more sophisticated exposure assessment methods in epidemiologic studies of childhood cancer.

Also, there have been some reports of links between an FH and some other malignancies (mostly uterus, ovary, and prostate cancers), and an increased risk of developing BC. In this paper we present descriptive report of the occurrence pattern of malignancies in families of BC afflicted patients through 4 generations. Patients included 542 Iranian primary BC cases, presenting at an outpatient clinic for treatment and follow-up. Detailed pedigrees were drawn for each patient, and data for a total of 6220 relatives were gathered. Among the probands, 29.9% and 53.9% had a positive FH of BC and other malignancies (OM) respectively. Mean number of breast cancers was nearly double in maternal-lines versus paternal-line relatives. Also, occurrence of brain, uterus, and colorectal cancers was significantly higher in maternal-line relatives, but conversely, liver cancer showed a tendency toward paternal-line relatives (1st degree relatives excluded). The highest frequency of BC involvement was noted in 2nd degree/2nd generation, and 3rd degree/3rd generation relatives. For OMs, although gastric cancer was by far the most frequent OM across pedigrees, uterus cancer, and hematopoeitic system lesions (leukemia) predominated over gastric cancer through the 3rd and 4th generations respectively. We did not find any relation between having a positive FH of BC, and developing early-onset BC.

A major concern is whether BLV infection of dairy cows alters milk yield. Although several studies have examined the effect of BLV on milk production in vivo, the results were inconclusive. No in vitro studies have been done. The discovery of BLV in mammary epithelial cells (MEC) of infected cows raises the possibility that the virus could affect these cells directly. The purpose of this study was to use an in vitro system to determine if BLV could alter milk yield by altering cell number and/or milk production per cell. A short-term cell line established from the MEC of a BLV-negative cow, and a proven casein-producer mouse cell line, Comma D, were stably transfected with a plasmid containing the entire BLV genome. Untransfected parental lines served as negative controls. The BLV-containing bovine MEC line has a reduced population-doubling time, higher saturation density, and increased longevity. The Comma D line is an already-transformed cell line, and growth properties did not change after transfection with BLV. Under appropriate differentiation conditions, both the bovine and mouse MEC transfected with BLV displayed decreased casein production and mRNA synthesis compared with control cell lines without BLV. Our results suggest that effects of BLV infection on milk production may not be related solely to overall animal health but may also be mediated directly at a cellular level.","['Motton, D D', 'Buehring, G C']","['Motton DD', 'Buehring GC']","['Infectious Diseases Division, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,2003/09/26 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/09/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-0302(03)73880-6 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73880-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2003 Sep;86(9):2826-38. doi: 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73880-6.,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caseins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Cattle', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the differences between these two types are far less numerous than initially thought. Morphological analyses might provide important information to distinguish apoptotic from necrotic samples. We recently reported that in necrotic, but not apoptotic, HL-60 human myeloid leukaemia cells, the nuclear protein topoisomerase IIalpha concentrated in nucleoli. In order to ascertain whether or not this phenomenon was restricted to a peculiar cell type or could be detected also in cells of lymphoid lineage, we performed an investigation aimed at defining the localization of topoisomerase IIalpha in apoptotic and necrotic Jurkat human T lymphoblastoid cells. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that topoisomerase IIalpha was excluded from the condensed chromatin of apoptotic cells, whereas in necrotic cells it was localized in discrete nuclear dots. Immuno-electron microscopy analysis showed that topoisomerase IIalpha was undetectable in nucleoli of normal and apoptotic cells, whereas it was present in the nucleolus of necrotic cells irrespectively of the type of inducer used (ethanol, H(2)O(2), HgCl(2)). Taken together, our findings identify topoisomerase IIalpha as a potential morphological marker useful to discriminate between apoptotic and necrotic cells.","['Falcieri, Elisabetta', 'Burattini, Sabrina', 'Bortul, Roberta', 'Luchetti, Francesca', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Falcieri E', 'Burattini S', 'Bortul R', 'Luchetti F', 'Tabellini G', 'Tazzari PL', 'Cappellini A', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","['Istituto di Scienze Morfologiche, Campus Scientifico, Localita Crocicchia, Universita di Urbino, 61029 Urbino, Italy. e.falcieri@uniurb.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,2003/09/25 05:00,2003/12/17 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jemt.10386 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2003 Oct 15;62(3):192-200. doi: 10.1002/jemt.10386.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Necrosis']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

Reductions in systemic GVHD are frequently associated with a corresponding diminishment of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response. In this study, we tested the effects of a novel recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor, repifermin (keratinocyte growth factor-2), on the induction of GVHD in a well-defined murine BMT model (B6 --> B6D2F1). Administration of repifermin (5 mg/kg/d) to allogeneic BMT recipients resulted in a significant decrease in both systemic GVHD and target organ histopathology. Repifermin treatment also reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide compared with control mice. In contrast, repifermin did not affect T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, or cytotoxic responses to host antigens. When 2000 host-derived P815 (H-2(d)) leukemia cells were added to the bone marrow inoculum, repifermin preserved GVL effects and resulted in significantly delayed mortality compared with control-treated allogeneic BMT recipients.

Several DHSS appear to be involved in regulating the level of endogenous expression and in the PMA response of hematopoietic cell lines. A DHSS unique to resting HL-60 cells and induced in CHRF 288-11 by PMA may explain the high degree of endogenous expression in HL-60 relative to HEL and CHRF (Schick, B.

A total of 4 DHSS in intron 1 and 6 in intron 2 are associated with the PMA response in a cell-specific manner. A DHSS in the 5'-flanking region and another in intron 1 lie in areas that have high homology with the orthologous murine serglycin locus and are rich in potential transcription factor binding sites. One DHSS in intron 1 and one in intron 2 are located within Alu repeats. Two DHSS found in DNA of normal primary neutrophils were different from those of the cell lines. One DHSS in exon 2 unique to neutrophils correlated with a previously unrecognized alternative splicing that removes exon 2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells had a DHSS in intron 1 that was common with the cell lines. The different patterns of DHSS exhibited by the cells studied suggest that cell- and differentiation-specific alterations in chromatin structure may control serglycin gene expression.","['Castronuevo, Patria', 'Thornton, Michael A', 'McCarthy, Lois E', 'Klimas, Joanne', 'Schick, Barbara P']","['Castronuevo P', 'Thornton MA', 'McCarthy LE', 'Klimas J', 'Schick BP']","['Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M310220200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75634-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 5;278(49):48704-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M310220200.

This study of a large number of patients with B-cell malignancies, over an extended period of time, characterized their human antimouse antibody (HAMA) seroconversion. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 617 samples from 112 subjects were analyzed for HAMA titers. Eighty-five patients with B-cell malignancies; 12 breast cancer patients, and 15 volunteers were titered for comparison. Fifty-six B-cell malignancy patients were titered for HAMA throughout Lym-1 radioimmunotherapy (RIT); 29 were titered after a single imaging dose of Lym-1 antibody. RESULTS: Baseline titers did not correlate with subsequent HAMA seroconversion against Lym-1. Only 1 of 29 (3%) of the patients developed HAMA after an imaging dose of Lym-1. Of the RIT trial group, 37 of 56 (66%) never developed HAMA above baseline despite multiple doses. Of those who did (19 of 56; or 34%), the HAMA responses fell into two categories. Thirteen responded rapidly (median of 31 days) and were termed ""early responders,"" whereas 6, termed ""late responders,"" had a median response time of 111 days. Early responders developed higher peak HAMA titers with fewer exposures to Lym-1 and took longer to return to baseline than did the late responders. The frequency of new antiglobulin seroconversion decreased as the number of exposures increased. CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-seven percent of B-cell malignancy patients developed no response or a weak response after multiple doses of mouse Lym-1 antibody. Positive responders occurred in all histology types and fell into two categories differing in seroconversion time and titer, possibly indicative of the initial state of the immune system.","['DeNardo, Gerald L', 'Mirick, Gary R', 'Kroger, Linda A', 'Bradt, Bonnie M', 'Lamborn, Kathleen R', 'DeNardo, Sally J']","['DeNardo GL', 'Mirick GR', 'Kroger LA', 'Bradt BM', 'Lamborn KR', 'DeNardo SJ']","['University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California 95816, USA. gldenardo@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 1;9(10 Pt 2):4013S-21S.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lym-1 monoclonal antibody)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged']",['CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to better understand the mode of action of epratuzumab, the antibody was tested in vitro in a variety of cell-based assays similar to those used to evaluate the biological activity of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, including rituximab. In this report, we present epratuzumab activities as they relate to binding, signaling, and internalization of the receptor CD22. METHODS: Chinese hamster ovary-expressed CD22 extracellular domain was used to measure epratuzumab affinity on Biacore. CD22 receptor density and internalization rate were measured indirectly using a monovalently labeled, noncompeting (with epratuzumab) anti-CD22 antibody on Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, primary B cells derived from fresh tonsils, and B cells separated from peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or healthy volunteers. Epratuzumab-induced CD22 phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitation/Western blot and compared with that induced by anti-IgM stimulation. RESULTS: Epratuzumab binds to CD22-extracellular domain, with an affinity of K(D) = 0.7 nM. Binding of epratuzumab to B cell lines, or primary B cells from healthy individuals and patients with NHL, results in rapid internalization of the CD22/antibody complex. Internalization appears to be faster at early time points in cell lines than in primary B cells and NHL patient-derived B cells, but the maximum internalization reached is comparable for all B cell populations after several hours of treatment and appears to reach saturation at antibody concentrations of 1-5 micro g/ml. Finally, epratuzumab binding results in modest but significant CD22 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Epratuzumab represents an excellent anti-CD22 ligating agent, highly efficacious in inducing CD22 internalization, and can induce phosphorylation.

A recent study demonstrated frequent expression of a chemokine receptor, CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4, which is known as a Th2 marker but not CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)3, which is known as a Th1 marker, among both ATLL- and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-immortalized T cells. In this study, immunostaining analysis for CCR4 and CXCR3 expression in ATLL cells obtained from 103 patients with ATLL was performed, and the clinical parameters and overall survival of the CCR4-positive and -negative cases were compared. Ninety-one (88.3%) of the 103 cases were positive for CCR4 staining, whereas only 5 (4.9%) were positive for CXCR3 staining. Positivity for CCR4 was significantly associated with skin involvement (P < 0.05), although there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the CCR4-positive and -negative cases at the time of initial diagnosis. CCR4(+) ATLL cells may accumulate in the skin because of the expression of a CCR4 ligand, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), on normal and inflamed cutaneous endothelia. As for survival analysis, positivity for CCR4 expression was extracted as an unfavorable prognostic factor as well as other factors, including the presence of B symptoms and extranodal involvement of more than one site. Multivariate analysis confirmed that CCR4 expression was an independent and significant prognostic factor (P < 0.05). Thus, our finding may provide a novel insight into not only the biological but also the clinical features of ATLL.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Takeuchi, Genji', 'Shimizu, Shigeki', 'Ito, Masato', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Wakita, Atsushi', 'Eimoto, Tadaaki', 'Matsushima, Kouji', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ishida T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Iida S', 'Inagaki H', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Kusumoto S', 'Takeuchi G', 'Shimizu S', 'Ito M', 'Komatsu H', 'Wakita A', 'Eimoto T', 'Matsushima K', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Nagoya 467-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/05/29 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 1;9(10 Pt 1):3625-34.,"['0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL17', 'Chemokines, CC/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/mortality', 'Ligands', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the safety and efficacy in these patients of a diphtheria fusion protein DAB(389)IL2 (denileukin diftitox) directed against the interleukin 2 receptor that is expressed by CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DAB(389)IL2 was administered by 60 min i.v. infusions for 5 days every 21 days at 9 or 18 micro g/kg/day for up to eight cycles. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated. The mean age of the patients was 61.8 years. There were 14 males and 4 females. Two had Rai stage I, 6 had Rai stage II, and 10 had Rai stage IV. The mean number of prior treatments was 4.5 (range, 1-11). Responses were evaluated by peripheral CLL counts, computed tomography scans of all nodes and bone marrow biopsies. Twelve patients received greater than or equal to three cycles of DAB(389)IL2 and were evaluable for response. Eleven of 12 patients showed reductions of peripheral CLL cells, with 6 of 11 showing >/=="" BORDER=""0"">95% reductions. Seven of 12 patients showed reductions of node diameters on exam and computed tomography scans, and 2 of 12 showed 60 and 80% shrinkage, respectively. Pre and postbone marrow biopsies showed a reduction in CLL marrow index in 11 patients. Seven of 11 patients had >50% reduction, including >/=="" BORDER=""0"">98% reduction in 3 patients. DAB(389)IL2 produced 2 of 12 (17%) partial remission and 7 of 12 (58%) minimal responses. Progression-free intervals in the responders were 1, 1, 3+, 4, 9, 10, 10+, 14 and 19+ months. Toxicities were mild to moderate and included asymptomatic, transient transaminasemia, fever, asthenia, hypoalbuminemia, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, rash, anorexia, vascular leak syndrome, and elevated creatinine kinase. Antidiphtheria toxin antibody levels were variable and ranged from 0 to 9 micro g/ml (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: DAB(389)IL2 produced a rapid decrease of leukemic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of most chemotherapy refractory CLL patients. Most patients also tolerated DAB(389)IL2 well, without significant myelosuppression and/or immunosuppression. The prolonged progression-free interval and subjectively observed quality-of-life in responders is intriguing. The results suggest DAB(389)IL2 has biological activity in patients with B-cell CLL. Follow-up studies of combinations or altered schedules or doses to improve the response rate are warranted.","['Frankel, Arthur E', 'Fleming, Donald R', 'Hall, Philip D', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Black, Jennifer H', 'Leftwich, Carole', 'Gartenhaus, Ronald']","['Frankel AE', 'Fleming DR', 'Hall PD', 'Powell BL', 'Black JH', 'Leftwich C', 'Gartenhaus R']","['Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA. afranckel@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/05/29 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 1;9(10 Pt 1):3555-61.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '25E79B5CTM (denileukin diftitox)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2004 May 15;10(10):3572-5.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the health status of adult survivors of childhood cancer and siblings and to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health status was assessed in 9535 adult participants of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of long-term survivors of childhood cancer who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. A randomly selected cohort of the survivors' siblings (n = 2916) served as a comparison group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six health status domains were assessed: general health, mental health, functional status, activity limitations, cancer-related pain, and cancer-related anxiety/fears. The first 4 domains were assessed in the control group. RESULTS: Survivors were significantly more likely to report adverse general health (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.0; P<.001), mental health (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1; P<.001), activity limitations (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.3; P<.001), and functional impairment (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.1-6.6; P<.001), compared with siblings. Forty-four percent of survivors reported at least 1 adversely affected health status domain. Sociodemographic factors associated with reporting at least 1 adverse health status domain included being female (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6; P<.001), lower level of educational attainment (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2; P<.001), and annual income less than 20 000 dollars (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1; P<.001). Relative to those survivors with childhood leukemia, an increased risk was observed for at least 1 adverse health status domain among those with bone tumors (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.5; P<.001), central nervous system tumors (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-2.0; P<.001), and sarcomas (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P =.01). CONCLUSION: Clinicians caring for adult survivors of childhood cancer should be aware of the substantial risk for adverse health status, especially among females, those with low educational attainment, and those with low household incomes.","['Hudson, Melissa M', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Hobbie, Wendy', 'Chen, Hegang', 'Gurney, James G', 'Yeazel, Mark', 'Recklitis, Christopher J', 'Marina, Neyssa', 'Robison, Leslie R', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Hudson MM', 'Mertens AC', 'Yasui Y', 'Hobbie W', 'Chen H', 'Gurney JG', 'Yeazel M', 'Recklitis CJ', 'Marina N', 'Robison LR', 'Oeffinger KC']","[""Department of Hematology Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Memphis 38105, USA. melissa.hudson@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,2003/09/25 05:00,2003/09/30 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/jama.290.12.1583 [doi]', '290/12/1583 [pii]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2003 Sep 24;290(12):1583-92. doi: 10.1001/jama.290.12.1583.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/physiopathology/psychology/therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Survivors']","['5U24-CA-55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Investigators'],,,"['JAMA. 2003 Sep 24;290(12):1641-3.

In the present study, the two pairs of flavonoids of hesperetin (HT) and hesperidin (HD; HT-7-rutinose), and naringenin (NE) and naringin (NE-7-rutinose), were used to study their apoptosis-inducing activities in HL-60 cells. Both HD and NI are flavonoids which contain a rutinoside at the C7 of HT and NE, respectively. Results of the MTT assay showed that HT and NE, but not HD and NI, exhibited significant cytotoxic effect in HL-60 cells, accompanied by the dose- and time-dependent appearance of characteristics of apoptosis including an increase in DNA ladder intensity, morphological changes, appearance of apoptotic bodies, and an increase in hypodiploid cells by flow cytometry analysis. HT and NE, but not HD and NI, caused rapid and transient induction of caspase-3/CPP32 activity, but not caspase-1 activity, according to the cleavage of caspase-3 substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and D4-GDI proteins, the appearance of cleaved caspase-3 fragments detected in HT- or NE-, but not in HD- or NI-treated HL-60 cells. A decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, was detected in HT- and NE-treated HL-60 cells, whereas other Bcl-2 family proteins including Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bag remained unchanged. The caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-FMK, but not the caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-FMK, attenuated HT- and NE-induced cell death. Interestingly, neither HT nor NE induced apoptosis in the mature monocytic cell line THP-1 and primary human polymorphonuclear cells, as characterized by a lack of DNA ladders, caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and Mcl-1 decrease, compared with those in HL-60 cells. In addition, the rutinoside group in HD and NI was removed by hesperidinase and naringinase, accompanied by the production of HT and NE, respectively, according to HPLC analysis. Accordingly, hesperidinase and naringinase digestion recovered the apoptosis-inducing activity of HD and NI in HL-60 cells. Our experiments provide the first evidence to suggest that rutinoside in flavonoids prevents the induction of apoptosis, and that activation of the traditional caspase-3 cascade participates in HT- and NE-induced apoptosis.","['Chen, Yen-Chou', 'Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Lin, Hui-Yi']","['Chen YC', 'Shen SC', 'Lin HY']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Hsing Street, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC. yc3270@tmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2003/09/25 05:00,2003/10/25 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203004556 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00455-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Oct 1;66(7):1139-50. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00455-6.,"['0 (ARHGDIB protein, human)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', 'E750O06Y6O (Hesperidin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (hesperidinase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (naringinase)', 'EC 3.2.1.21 (beta-Glucosidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'HN5425SBF2 (naringenin)', 'N7TD9J649B (naringin)', 'Q9Q3D557F1 (hesperetin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 1', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hesperidin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'beta-Glucosidase/metabolism', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERVENTION(S): Embryos were randomly cultured in different growth factor-treated or untreated in vitro systems. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Blastocyst formation and morphology, total cell numbers of day 5 blastocysts, birth rates, and characteristics of the offspring. RESULT(S): The beneficial effects of LIF or EGF on blastocyst development and morphology were observed only in IVF50 medium but not in sequential IVF50-S2 media. In addition, blastocysts generated from the LIF-supplemented cultures had higher total cell numbers and higher total birth rates after transfer compared to those from IVF50 medium alone. No significant effect on fetal development was observed but pups born after treatment in LIF-supplemented sequential cultures had prolonged gestation and increased birth weights. CONCLUSION(S): The beneficial effects of LIF and EGF on in vitro blastocyst development are mainly seen under suboptimal culture conditions (simple medium only) and their effects are masked in an improved in vitro system (sequential culture media). Supplementation of culture media with such factors, however, is still an attractive approach in enhancing embryo viability through increased total cell numbers. The beneficial effect of LIF in improving implantation and subsequent increased birth rates should be further explored.","['Cheung, Lai-Ping', 'Leung, Ho-Yin', 'Bongso, Ariff']","['Cheung LP', 'Leung HY', 'Bongso A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, SAR China, Shatin, Hong Kong. lpcheung@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,2003/09/25 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0015028203007726 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(03)00772-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2003 Sep;80 Suppl 2:727-35. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(03)00772-6.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects/physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: There were 54 CML patients including 17 patients in chronic phase (CP), 13 patients in accelerated phase (AP) and 24 patients in blast crisis (BC). The dosage of imatinib is 400 mg/day for CP patients and 600 mg/day for AP and BC patients. The prescribed dose was administrated orally, once daily after a meal with a large glass of water. Before starting the imatinib administration, all the patients had thorough physical examination as well as blood and bone marrow examination, Ph chromosome and or the bcr/abl fusion-gene detection. Blood picture was examined twice a week in the first month of administration and thereafter weekly or fortnightly in the following days. Hepatic and renal function was tested fortnightly or every four weeks. Patients had bone marrow examination, Ph chromosome and or the bcr/abl fusion-gene detection again when they achieved a hematological response (CR). Dose was adjusted from time to time according to the results of blood examination and the patients tolerance to the drug. RESULTS: After a median 5-month period of follow-up, all the 17 CP patients achieved complete hematological response, including 6 cases (35.2%) whose Ph chromosome turned negative after treatment. 8 (61.5%) out of the 13 AP patients and 9 (37.5%) out of the 24 BC patients returned to chronic phase respectively. Adverse events included myelosuppression, periorbital edema or edema of the lower limbs, myalgia and muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, low fever, tetter and bilirubin increasing. CONCLUSIONS: imatinib has good early efficacy in the treatment of CML and the therapeutic result is the best in the CP patients, next in the AP patients and relatively poor in the BP patients. The long term outcome of imatinib needs further observation. Patients have a good tolerance to imatinib.","['Lou, Fang-ding', 'Lu, Xue-chun']","['Lou FD', 'Lu XC']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2003 Aug;42(8):571-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver injury was induced in mice by Con A. The in vitro assays for examining the adhesions of spleen T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) were also performed. RESULTS: N-desulfated heparin significantly inhibited the elevation in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase activities in serum, and recovered the superoxide dismutase activity in the liver tissue of mice with liver injury. In liver histological examination, the inflammatory infiltration, hepatocyte degeneration and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were remarkably improved by N-desulfated heparin. Multiple administrations of the heparin derivative for one day showed a more potent prevention of the liver injury than did single dosing for three days. N-desulfated heparin significantly inhibited the adhesion of spleen cells and purified T lymphocytes isolated from the liver injured mice to either type I collagen or fibronectin but not to laminin. The heparin derivative also showed a similar inhibition of the adhesion of spleen cells from normal mice, stimulated in vitro with Con A, whereas it did not affect their proliferation. Moreover, the adhesion of human leukemia Jurkat cells to collagen I was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin. CONCLUSION: N-desulfated heparin may improve immunological liver injury partly via reducing the functions, such as the adhesion to ECM, of T lymphocytes.","['Yuan, L', 'Geng, J G', 'Xu, Q']","['Yuan L', 'Geng JG', 'Xu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 22 Han Kou Road, 210093 Nanjing, China. molpharm@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

We propose, that intracellular redirection of oncogenic proteins towards novel targets can be used to specifically kill tumor cells. For example, an oncogenic kinase could be redirected to activate an apoptosis inducing protein. This redirection approach offers the advantages of high specificity (the oncogene is restricted to tumor cells) and potentially high activity since it makes use of the intrinsic functions of the oncogene. Also, the oncogene is not only functionally inhibited but it is turned against the cancer cell. Activity and specificity of the redirection therapy approach were demonstrated in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cells. A recombinant protein redirected the transcriptionally inhibitory AML1-ETO protein to essential proliferation-associated promoters. As a result, leukemia cells were inhibited with high effectivity and specificity. This approach can be utilized to target a wide variety of human cancers.","['Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Steffen B', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Dept of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Domagkstr 3, 48129 Munster, Germany. mueller@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['585 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.2.6.585 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2003 Nov-Dec;2(6):531-3. doi: 10.4161/cc.2.6.585.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hallmark of all cancers is the capacity for unlimited self-renewal, which is also a defining characteristic of normal stem cells. Given this shared attribute, it has been proposed that leukemias may be initiated by transforming events that take place in hematopoietic stem cells. Alternatively, leukemias may also arise from more committed progenitors caused by mutations and/or selective expression of genes that enhance their otherwise limited self-renewal capabilities. Identifying the LSCs for each type of leukemia is a current challenge and a critical step in understanding their respective biologies and may provide key insights into more effective treatments. Moreover, LSC identification and purification will provide a powerful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool in the clinic.","['Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Ailles, Laurie E', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Passegue E', 'Jamieson CH', 'Ailles LE', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2003/09/25 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.2034201100 [doi]', '2034201100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Sep 30;100 Suppl 1:11842-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2034201100.

Because clinical observations suggest that leukemic cells accumulate at different rates, we measured telomere length and telomerase activity in B-CLL cells to distinguish differences in cellular replication. Our data indicate that the telomeres of B-CLL cells are shorter than telomeres of B cells from healthy subjects, indicating that the leukemic cells have a prolonged proliferative history. Leukemic cells of the immunoglobulin V gene mutation subgroups differ in telomere length and telomerase activity. B lymphocytes from the subgroup with poor outcome and with limited IgV gene mutations have uniformly shorter telomeres and more telomerase activity than those from the subgroup with better outcome and with considerable mutations. Differences in telomere length appear to largely reflect the proliferative histories of precursors of the leukemic cells, although differences in cell division, masked by the action of telomerase, cannot be excluded. These results may provide insight into the stages of maturation and the activation pathways of the cells that give rise to B-CLL. In addition, they reinforce the concept that B-CLL is not simply an accumulative disease of slowly dividing B lymphocytes but possibly one of B cells with extensive proliferative histories.","['Damle, Rajendra N', 'Batliwalla, Franak M', 'Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Valetto, Angelo', 'Albesiano, Emilia', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan', 'Vinciguerra, Vincent P', 'Kudalkar, Prasad', 'Wasil, Tarun', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Gregersen, Peter K', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Damle RN', 'Batliwalla FM', 'Ghiotto F', 'Valetto A', 'Albesiano E', 'Sison C', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz J', 'Vinciguerra VP', 'Kudalkar P', 'Wasil T', 'Rai KR', 'Ferrarini M', 'Gregersen PK', 'Chiorazzi N']","['North Shore-Long Island Jewish Research Institute, 350 Community Dr, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-04-1345 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54612-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jan 15;103(2):375-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-04-1345.

Apart from inhibition of the Abl protein tyrosine kinases, it also shows activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), c-Kit, Abl-related gene (ARG), and their fusion proteins while sparing other kinases. In vitro studies have revealed that imatinib mesylate can inhibit growth of cell lines and primitive malignant progenitor cells in CML expressing Bcr-Abl. However, little is known about the effects of imatinib mesylate on nonmalignant hematopoietic cells. In the current study we demonstrate that in vitro exposure of mobilized human CD34+ progenitors to therapeutic concentrations of imatinib mesylate (1-5 microM) inhibits their differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs). DCs obtained after 10 to 16 days of culture in the presence of imatinib mesylate showed concentration-dependent reduced expression levels of CD1a and costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD40. Furthermore, exposure to imatinib mesylate inhibited the induction of primary cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. The inhibitory effects of imatinib mesylate were accompanied by down-regulation of nuclear localized RelB protein. Our results demonstrate that imatinib mesylate can act on normal hematopoietic cells and inhibits the differentiation and function of DCs, which is in part mediated via the nuclear factor kappaB signal transduction pathway.","['Appel, Silke', 'Boehmler, Andreas M', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Muller, Martin R', 'Rupf, Anette', 'Weck, Markus M', 'Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Reichardt, Volker L', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Brossart, Peter']","['Appel S', 'Boehmler AM', 'Grunebach F', 'Muller MR', 'Rupf A', 'Weck MM', 'Hartmann U', 'Reichardt VL', 'Kanz L', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Brossart P']","['University of Tubingen, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Otfried-Muller Str 10, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-03-0975 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54636-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jan 15;103(2):538-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0975.

In 14 of 14 patients, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and/or CD4 proliferative responses developed after beginning vaccinations, and 11 of 14 patients showed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release by CD4 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) at one or more time points. These responses were CD4(+)CD45RO(+). A peptide-specific CD8(+) interferon-gamma ELISPOT was found in 4 patients. Four patients in hematologic remission had a decrease in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) percentage (3 concurrently receiving interferon-alpha and 1 on imatinib mesylate), and 3 patients in molecular relapse after allogenic transplantation became transiently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative after vaccination; 2 of these patients received concurrent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). All 5 patients on IFN-alpha ultimately reached a complete cytogenetic remission. In conclusion, a tumor-specific bcr-abl breakpoint peptide-derived vaccine can be safely administered and can reliably elicit measurable peptide-specific CD4 immune responses, including in patients after bone marrow transplantation, on interferon, or on imatinib mesylate.

They interact with 3 receptors: BAFF-R, specific to BAFF; and TACI and BCMA, which are shared by BAFF and APRIL. We tested the potential role of these proteins in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) resistance to apoptosis. TACI and BAFF-R mRNAs were found in leukemic B cells. BAFF and APRIL mRNAs and proteins were detected in B-CLL leukemic cells and normal blood or tonsil-derived B lymphocytes. Yet, in contrast to normal B lymphocytes, BAFF and APRIL were expressed at the membranes of leukemic cells. Adding soluble BAFF or APRIL protected B-CLL cells against spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and stimulated NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, adding soluble BCMA-Fc or anti-BAFF and anti-APRIL antibodies enhanced B-CLL apoptosis. Moreover, a soluble form of BAFF was detected using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) in the sera of B-CLL patients but not of healthy donors. Taken together, our results indicate that B-CLL cells can be rescued from apoptosis through an autocrine process involving BAFF, APRIL, and their receptors.

Following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), recipient tissues may not express a ligand for KIRs present within the graft, and the combination of donor KIR and recipient HLA-C types could influence outcome.

FLT3-D835/I836 mutations were found in 6 (5.4%) of 112 children with ALL older than 1 year and in 8 (16.0%) of 50 infants with ALL. Missense mutations were found in 11 patients, 3-base pair deletions in 2 patients, and a deletion/insertion in 1 patient. Remarkably, FLT3-D835/I836 mutations were found in 8 (18.2%) of 44 infants with ALL with MLL rearrangements and in 4 (21.5%) of 19 patients with hyperdiploid ALL, but they were not found in any patients older than 1 year who had TEL-AML1 (n = 11), E2APBX1 (n = 4), or BCR-ABL (n = 6) fusion genes. Although infant ALL patients with mutations had poorer prognoses than did those without mutations, pediatric ALL patients with mutations who were older than 1 year had good prognoses. We also found FLT3-D835 mutations in 2 of 11 leukemic cell lines with MLL rearrangements. FLT3 was highly phosphorylated in these cell lines with FLT3-D835 mutations, leading to constitutive activation of downstream targets such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) without FLT3 ligand stimulation. These results suggested that FLT3-D835/I836 mutations are one of the second genetic events in infant ALL with MLL rearrangements or pediatric ALL with hyperdiploidy.","['Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Furuichi, Yoshiyuki', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Sugita, Kenichi', 'Ida, Kohmei', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Taketani T', 'Taki T', 'Sugita K', 'Furuichi Y', 'Ishii E', 'Hanada R', 'Tsuchida M', 'Sugita K', 'Ida K', 'Hayashi Y']","[""Gunma Children's Medical Center, 779 Shimohadoka, Kitatachibana, Gunma 377-8577, Japan. hayashiy-tky@umin.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-02-0418 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50249-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Feb 1;103(3):1085-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0418.

We studied the methylation status of DAP-kinase of 194 bone marrow samples from 160 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 34 with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at the time of initial diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Hypermethylation of DAP-kinase was present in 27.5% (44 of 160) of AML and in 47% (16 of 34) of MDS specimens and significantly correlated to loss of DAP-kinase expression (P =.008). It was significantly more frequent in AML secondary to therapy for other malignancies (s-AML; 14 of 29, 48.3%), as compared to de novo AML (30 of 131, 22.9%, P =.01). DAP-kinase hypermethylation in AML was associated with myelodysplastic changes in the bone marrow at the time of the initial diagnosis (P =.002) and with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities (P =.02).

We previously reported that the AML1 molecules with trans-activation subdomains retained can rescue in vitro hematopoietic defects of AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells when expressed by using a knock-in approach. Extending this notion to in vivo conditions, we found that the knock-in ES cell clones with AML1 mutants, which retain trans-activation subdomains but lack C-terminal repression subdomains including the conserved VWRPY motif, contribute to hematopoietic tissues in chimera mice. We also found that germline mice homozygous for the mutated AML1 allele, which lacks the VWRPY motif, exhibit a minimal effect on hematopoietic development, as was observed in control knock-in mice with full-length AML1. On the other hand, reduced cell numbers and deviant CD4 expression were observed during early T-lymphoid ontogeny in the VWRPY-deficient mice, whereas the contribution to the thymus by the corresponding ES cell clones was inadequate. These findings demonstrate that AML1 with its trans-activating subdomains is essential and sufficient for hematopoietic development in the context of the entire mouse. In addition, its trans-repression activity, depending on the C-terminal VWRPY motif, plays a role in early thymocyte development.","['Nishimura, Motohiro', 'Fukushima-Nakase, Yoko', 'Fujita, Yasuko', 'Nakao, Mitsushige', 'Toda, Shogo', 'Kitamura, Nobuo', 'Abe, Tatsuo', 'Okuda, Tsukasa']","['Nishimura M', 'Fukushima-Nakase Y', 'Fujita Y', 'Nakao M', 'Toda S', 'Kitamura N', 'Abe T', 'Okuda T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-2109 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54639-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jan 15;103(2):562-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-2109.

We addressed these limitations by creating a multipurpose master vector (pMV) and cloning the tumor gene NY-ESO-1, which is highly expressed in more than 50% of advanced myeloma patients. pMV was constructed from a Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)-based retroviral backbone with the following features: (1) an extended packaging signal to achieve high viral titers, (2) a splice acceptor region to facilitate protein production, (3) a nonimmunogenic selectable marker, dihydrofolate reductase-L22Y (DHFR(L22Y)), to exclude the generation of CTLs against the selectable marker, (4) an internal ribosomal entry site between the tumor-specific gene (NY-ESO-1) and the selectable marker DHFR(L22Y) for coexpression of two heterologous gene products from a single bicistronic mRNA, minimizing the possibility of differential expression of these two genes, and (5) human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) cDNA driven by the human T-lymphotropic virus promoter to enhance DC function and viability. Recombinant virus of pMV-NY-ESO-1 was generated with vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein (VSV-G) in the GP2-293 cell line for efficient transduction. We present evidence that the DC phenotype is unaltered after transduction and that more than 85% of DCs express NY-ESO-1, which secrete approximately 40 ng of GM-CSF per 10(6) DCs.","['Batchu, R B', 'Moreno, A M', 'Szmania, S', 'Gupta, S K', 'Zhan, F', 'Rosen, N', 'Kozlowski, M', 'Spencer, T', 'Spagnoli, G C', 'Shaughnessy, J', 'Barlogie, B', 'Tricot, G', 'van Rhee, F']","['Batchu RB', 'Moreno AM', 'Szmania S', 'Gupta SK', 'Zhan F', 'Rosen N', 'Kozlowski M', 'Spencer T', 'Spagnoli GC', 'Shaughnessy J', 'Barlogie B', 'Tricot G', 'van Rhee F']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403322319417 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Sep 20;14(14):1333-45. doi: 10.1089/104303403322319417.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CTAG1B protein, human)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Testis/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The United Kingdom (UK) Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was tasked with investigating the possible dangers to flight safety of treatment with this type of chemotherapy. METHODS: From CAA computer records of 18,319 professional license holders, 14 were identified as having received anthracycline treatment. These subjects underwent clinical cardiological examination, exercise and 24 h ambulatory electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Other studies were performed as needed. RESULTS: Of the 14 subjects, 9 demonstrated arrhythmias on ambulatory electrocardiography, including 4 with ventricular tachycardia and 5 with supraventricular tachycardia, a much higher incidence than expected. One pilot had evidence of left ventricular dysfunction and another developed symptomatic sinus arrest at first follow-up. Another died shortly after completing the investigations from acute lymphatic leukemia, probably a complication of his original chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. In this small cohort there seemed to be no correlation of abnormal findings with anthracycline dose nor with time since completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented strongly suggest the need for cardiological review of individuals who have received anthracycline treatment and who are seeking initial certification or recertification for professional aviation licensing.","['Evans, Sally A', 'Cooke, John N C']","['Evans SA', 'Cooke JN']","['United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority, Gatwick, West Sussex, UK. sally.evans@srg.caa.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",7501714,2003/09/25 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/09/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Aviat Space Environ Med. 2003 Sep;74(9):1003-8.,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aerospace Medicine/*standards', 'Air Ambulances/standards', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Cardiovascular System/drug effects', 'Certification', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Heart Block/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United Kingdom', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/chemically induced/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated occupational exposure and cancer incidence among Finnish laboratory workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort was comprised of 4,722 laboratory workers reported to the Finnish Register of Workers Exposed to Carcinogens in 1979-1988. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for cancers and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on data of the Finnish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: The most common carcinogens, to which these workers were potentially exposed, were chromium (VI), carbon tetrachloride, cadmium, benzene, and chloroform. From this cohort, 174 persons were recorded with primary tumors in 1980-1999. The SIR for cancer of all sites combined was 0.99 (CI 0.85-1.14). None of the cancer-specific SIRs were significantly elevated. Slight excesses were found, e.g., for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (seven observed, 4.8 expected) and leukemia (four observed, three expected). CONCLUSIONS: This study did not suggest any major cancer risks among Finnish laboratory workers but the follow-up time of the cohort was too short (on an average 15.7 years) to reveal possible cancer risks requiring a longer induction period.","['Kauppinen, Timo', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Saalo, Anja', 'Sasco, Annie J']","['Kauppinen T', 'Pukkala E', 'Saalo A', 'Sasco AJ']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland. tkau@occuphealth.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.10278 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2003 Oct;44(4):343-50. doi: 10.1002/ajim.10278.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Laboratory Chemicals)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Laboratory Chemicals/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

We first carried out a functional class identity assignment for the 60 NCI cancer testing cell lines via hierarchical clustering of gene expression data. Comprised of nine clinical tissue types, the 60 cell lines were placed into six classes-melanoma, leukemia, renal, lung, and colorectal, and the sixth class was comprised of mixed tissue cell lines not found in any of the other five classes. We then carried out supervised machine learning, using the GI(50) values tested on a panel of 60 NCI cancer cell lines. For separate 3-class and 2-class problem clustering, we successfully carried out clear cell line class separation at high stringency, p < 0.01 (Bonferroni corrected t-statistic), using feature reduction clustering algorithms embedded in RadViz, an integrated high dimensional analytic and visualization tool. We started with the 1400 compound GI(50) values as input and selected only those compounds, or features, significant in carrying out the classification. With this approach, we identified two small sets of compounds that were most effective in carrying out complete class separation of the melanoma, non-melanoma classes and leukemia, non-leukemia classes. To validate these results, we showed that these two compound sets' GI(50) values were highly accurate classifiers using five standard analytical algorithms. One compound set was most effective against the melanoma class cell lines (14 compounds), and the other set was most effective against the leukemia class cell lines (30 compounds). The two compound classes were both significantly enriched in two different types of substituted p-quinones. The melanoma cell line class of 14 compounds was comprised of 11 compounds that were internal substituted p-quinones, and the leukemia cell line class of 30 compounds was comprised of 6 compounds that were external substituted p-quinones. Attempts to subclassify melanoma or leukemia cell lines based upon their clinical cancer subtype met with limited success. For example, using GI(50) values for the 30 compounds we identified as effective against all leukemia cell lines, we could subclassify acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) origin cell lines from non-ALL leukemia origin cell lines without significant overlap from non-leukemia cell lines. Based upon clustering using GI(50) values for the 60 cancer cell lines laid out by the RadViz algorithm, these two compound subsets did not overlap with clusters containing any of the NCI's 92 compounds of known mechanism of action, a few of which are quinones.

During or soon after induction therapy, leukemic patients frequently develop gastroenteric complications, characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea. The association of these symptoms with fever and melena is typical of necrotizing enterocolitis (NE), a life-threatening condition that can be documented by ultrasound abdominal scan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the clinical course of 169 adult patients with AML treated by standard dose Ara-C-containing induction regimens, either by continuous venous infusion (group 1) or subcutaneous injection (group 2). Ultrasonography was employed as early diagnostic tool in a majority of patients with gastroenteric complications. Bowel wall thickening was accurately measured and used to confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. RESULTS: In the first group of 115 patients (median age, 51 years), gastroenteric complications were observed in 55 patients (48%), and 10 patients (9%) received diagnosis of NE, which was fatal in four. Patients with NE had a median age older than that of patients without gastroenteric symptoms, and a more prolonged neutropenia. In the second group of 54 patients (median age, 60 years), gastroenteric events were observed in 14 patients (26%), and no case of NE was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis shows that NE is a serious complication occurring mainly in patients treated by Ara-C administered as continuous i.v. infusion.","['Camera, Andrea', 'Andretta, Claudia', 'Villa, Maria Rosaria', 'Volpicelli, Mario', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Rossi, Marco', 'Rinaldi, Ciro Roberto', 'Della Cioppa, Paola', 'Ciancia, Rosanna', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'Rotoli, Bruno']","['Camera A', 'Andretta C', 'Villa MR', 'Volpicelli M', 'Picardi M', 'Rossi M', 'Rinaldi CR', 'Della Cioppa P', 'Ciancia R', 'Selleri C', 'Rotoli B']","['Division of Hematology, Federico II University Medical School, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200304 [doi]', '6200304 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(5):346-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200304.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Enterocolitis, Necrotizing/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intestinal Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that retinoic acid (RA) isomers, all-trans-RA (ATRA), 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA, induce growth arrest and apoptosis in ATL cell lines. In this study we investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by RAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ATL cell line, KK1, established from an ATL patient was cultured with or without RAs. DNA fragmentation was analyzed using propidium iodide for staining DNA on a FACS. The apoptosis-related proteins and their transcriptional levels were thereafter analyzed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Caspase activity was determined by using specific fluorogenic substrates. RESULTS: Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are constitutively expressed in KK1. Treatment with RAs caused the level of Bcl-x protein decreased, while the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xS remained unchanged. The level of Bax tended to decrease. There was a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 and -6 without any activation of caspase-1. Broad range caspase inhibitors, Z-Asp and Z-VAD, prevented DNA fragmentation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RA-induced apoptotic signals were transduced via downregulation of Bcl-xL and the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane function leading to caspase-3 activation.","['Fujimura, Satoshi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kuroki, Masahide', 'Ono, Junko']","['Fujimura S', 'Suzumiya J', 'Yamada Y', 'Kuroki M', 'Ono J']","['Molecular Oncology Center, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. fujimura@minf.med.fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200321 [doi]', '6200321 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(5):328-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200321.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) with expression limited to the hematopoietic system may have a prominent role in the graft-versus-leukemia reaction. Earlier in vitro studies demonstrated that cytotoxic T cells specific for the minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 only lysed cells of hematopoietic origin. Despite this limited expression, an HA-1 mismatch is associated with GvHD. Yet, the hematopoietic-restricted HA-1 membrane expression motivated us to develop an ex vivo HA-1-specific protocol for cellular immunotherapy of relapsed leukemia. To ensure the feasibility and safety of such cellular therapy, broad HA-1 RNA analysis is indispensable. Here we demonstrate the hematopoietic-restricted expression at the HA-1 gene transcriptional level with high RNA expression in normal and in malignant hematopoietic cells and background expression levels in nonhematopoietic cells. In tissues that showed low HA-1 RNA expression, hematopoietic cells were present as demonstrated by CD45 RNA expression analyzed in parallel. Thus, the mHag HA-1 can function as an excellent target antigen for immunotherapy of hematological malignancies with no or low risk of GvHD.","['Wilke, Martina', 'Dolstra, Harry', 'Maas, Frans', 'Pool, Jos', 'Brouwer, Rolf', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Rebello, Ashok', 'Lamers, Femke', 'Schuuring, Ed', 'Kluin, Philip', 'Brasseur, Francis', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Wilke M', 'Dolstra H', 'Maas F', 'Pool J', 'Brouwer R', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Rebello A', 'Lamers F', 'Schuuring E', 'Kluin P', 'Brasseur F', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200318 [doi]', '6200318 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(5):315-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200318.,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis/*genetics', 'Oligopeptides/analysis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analog induces apoptosis in and exerts pronounced antiproliferative effects on various human tumors (colon, pancreas, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, hepatoma) cell lines. The growth of human xenografts (prostate, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma) and animal tumors (colon-26, P-388, S-180, B16, MXT) was inhibited by TT-232 (dose range: 30-750 microg/kg/day) in 54-98% of cases. Continuous long-term infusion proved to be the most effective way of administration. TT-232 combined with decarbazine or etoposide treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of these drugs on human melanoma and lymphoma xenografts, respectively. Regarding the mode of action, TT-232 activates cell cycle inhibitors via SSTR receptors, inhibits tyrosine kinases through interfering with the proliferative signaling cascades, and interacts with an intracellular receptor and an enzyme involved in glycolysis causing translocation of this enzyme to the nucleus, thus inducing apoptosis.

Occupational benzene exposure is a possible cause of this excess. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of lympho-hematopoietic cancer nested within the existing cohort study to examine the role of benzene exposure. Cases identified between 1981 and 1999 (N = 79) were age-matched to 5 control subjects from the cohort. We estimated each subject's benzene exposure using occupational histories, local site-specific information, and an algorithm using Australian petroleum industry monitoring data. RESULTS: Matched analyses showed that the risk of leukemia was increased at cumulative exposures above 2 ppm-years and with intensity of exposure of highest exposed job over 0.8 ppm. Risk increased with higher exposures; for the 13 case-sets with greater than 8 ppm-years cumulative exposure, the odds ratio was 11.3 (95% confidence interval = 2.85-45.1). The risk of leukemia was not associated with start date or duration of employment. The association with type of workplace was explained by cumulative exposure. There is limited evidence that short-term high exposures carry more risk than the same amount of exposure spread over a longer period. The risks for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were raised for the highest exposed workers. No association was found between non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma and benzene exposure, nor between tobacco or alcohol consumption and any of the cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We found an excess risk of leukemia associated with cumulative benzene exposures and benzene exposure intensities that were considerably lower than reported in previous studies. No evidence was found of a threshold cumulative exposure below which there was no risk.","['Glass, Deborah C', 'Gray, Christopher N', 'Jolley, Damien J', 'Gibbons, Carl', 'Sim, Malcolm R', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Adams, Geoffrey G', 'Bisby, John A', 'Manuell, Richard']","['Glass DC', 'Gray CN', 'Jolley DJ', 'Gibbons C', 'Sim MR', 'Fritschi L', 'Adams GG', 'Bisby JA', 'Manuell R']","['Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Central and Eastern Clinical School, The Alfred Hospital, Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. deborah.glass@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,2003/09/23 05:00,2003/12/11 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.ede.0000082001.05563.e0 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2003 Sep;14(5):569-77. doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000082001.05563.e0.,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations', 'Petroleum']",,,,,,,,,,"['Epidemiology. 2004 Jul;15(4):509; author reply 510-1.

This review summarizes, in brief, the recent progress in the various attempts to prevent premature ovarian failure in these young women with unconsumed fertility potential. RECENT FINDINGS: The investigational endeavours of ovarian cryopreservation await the clinical experience of auto- or xenotransplantation, or in-vitro maturation of thawed primordial follicles, and in-vitro fertilization. Although promising, this procedure is not available yet. Moreover, the risk of possible reimplantation of malignant stem cells with the thawed cryopreserved ovary has been highlighted following experimental animal observations. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist has been efficient in primates in a prospective study, and in young women in several nonrandomized series. The disruption of the acid sphingomyelinase gene, or sphingosine-1-phosphate, in rodents can prevent follicle destruction by ionizing radiation, possibly indicating in-vivo protection in cancer patients at risk of iatrogenic sterilization. SUMMARY: The recent enormous scientific advance lends hope that the future may hold answers to the questions regarding safety and efficiency of oocyte, follicle, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and the most efficient means of using the thawed tissue - auto-, hetero-, or xenotransplantation versus IVM on the one hand, and in-vivo pharmacological attempts to minimize follicle depletion by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or other modalities on the other hand. Until then, a combination of all the clinically available modalities should be offered to these young women with unconsumed fertility potential who face gonadotoxic therapy.","['Blumenfeld, Zeev']",['Blumenfeld Z'],"['Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam medical Center, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. bzeev@techunix.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,9007264,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001703-200310000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol. 2003 Oct;15(5):359-70. doi: 10.1097/00001703-200310000-00003.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', '*Fertility', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Reproductive Techniques', '*Survivors']",,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that a pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with isolated brain gangliosides inhibited the release of preformed secretory mediators from cells activated via FcepsilonRI but not Thy-1 glycoprotein. Exogenously administered gangliosides also affected the cell-substrate adhesion and the levels of polymeric filamentous actin in Ag-activated cells. Although the production of phosphoinositides was also decreased, enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was not inhibited. Gangliosides had no or only marginal effect on the association of aggregated FcepsilonRI with glycosphingolipid-enriched membranes and on tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI and the linker for activation of T cells. Though pretreatment with gangliosides did not inhibit the association of linker for activation of T cells with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma1 and PLCgamma2, tyrosine phosphorylation of these enzymes, as well as their enzymatic activities and association with detergent-insoluble signaling assemblies were reduced. This resulted in a decreased production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and an inhibition of Ca(2+) mobilization.

Because screening of Flt3 in AML patients by PCR followed by gel electrophoresis is time-consuming and fails to detect some very small internal tandem duplications (ITDs), we developed a method for screening of FLT3 receptor mutations with PCR plus denaturing HPLC (D-HPLC). METHODS: Total mRNAs extracted from 34 AML patients were first analyzed for the presence of juxtamembrane length mutations and tyrosine kinase domain point mutations by a conventional method involving PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, and agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-RED-AGE). Subsequently, the same patient panel was analyzed by D-HPLC, using specifically designed primers and optimized running temperatures for the length and point mutation analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were analyzed by PCR-RED-AGE; 9 were positive for known Flt3 mutations: 6 of 34 (18%) for ITDs in exon 14 and 3 of 34 (9%) for point mutations in exon 20. The same patient panel was analyzed by D-HPLC, and additional nucleotide changes were discovered; in total, 14 sequence variations were identified: 7 of 34 (21%) for ITDs in exon 14; 2 of 34 (6%) for point mutations in exon 20; 1 of 34 (3%) for a new point mutation in exon 16; and 4 of 34 (12%) for polymorphisms in exons 13 and 14.

The present studies demonstrate that CDDO activates the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in U-937 leukemia cells.

The results also demonstrate that CDDO-induced: (a) stimulation of Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase; (b) activation of caspase-8; (c) loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential; (d) release of cytochrome c; and (e) cleavage of caspase-3 are blocked by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and GSH but not with cysteine.

Peptide prodrugs cleavable by peptidases present in the tumor environment have been explored to improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic drugs. One such prodrug of doxorubicin (Dox), CPI-0004Na [N-succinyl-beta-alanyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-L-leucyl-Dox (sALAL-Dox)] has been shown to have an improved antitumor efficacy profile with reduced toxicity compared with Dox in tumor xenograft models (V. Dubois et al., Cancer Res., 62: 2327-2331, 2002). In this study, we demonstrate that CD10, a cell surface metalloprotease expressed on a variety of tumor cell types, is capable of cleaving CPI-0004Na and related peptide prodrugs such as N-succinyl-beta-alanyl-L-isoleucyl-L-alanyl-L-leucyl-Dox (sAIAL-Dox). This proteolytic cleavage generates leucyl-Dox, which is capable of entering cells and generating intracellular Dox. In a [(3)H]thymidine proliferation assay, analogues of CPI-0004Na showed a 100-300-fold increase in potency on CD10(+) cells compared with CD10(-) cells. Cytotoxicity of CPI-0004Na was inhibited by phosphoramidon, a known inhibitor of CD10 enzymatic activity. Furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary CHO-S cells, which are resistant to CPI-0004Na, could be sensitized to the cytotoxic effect of the prodrug by transfection of a CD10 cDNA. Tumor xenograft studies using LNCaP prostate tumor cells support the important role of CD10 in the antitumor efficacy of these prodrugs against tumors expressing CD10. CPI-0004Na and sAIAL-Dox achieved statistically significant 70% tumor growth inhibition at day 22. CD10 is expressed on many types of human tumors including B-cell lymphoma, leukemia, and prostate, breast, colorectal, and lung carcinomas; therefore, CD10-cleavable prodrugs may be effective in a range of different tumor types.","['Pan, Chin', 'Cardarelli, Pina M', 'Nieder, Matthew H', 'Pickford, Lesley B', 'Gangwar, Sanjeev', 'King, David J', 'Yarranton, Geoffrey T', 'Buckman, Dana', 'Roscoe, William', 'Zhou, Fengmin', 'Salles, Adam', 'Chen, Tseng-Hui', 'Horgan, Killian', 'Wang, Yi-Hong', 'Nguyen, Thi', 'Bebbington, Christopher R']","['Pan C', 'Cardarelli PM', 'Nieder MH', 'Pickford LB', 'Gangwar S', 'King DJ', 'Yarranton GT', 'Buckman D', 'Roscoe W', 'Zhou F', 'Salles A', 'Chen TH', 'Horgan K', 'Wang YH', 'Nguyen T', 'Bebbington CR']","['Corixa Corp., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA. cpan@medarex.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2003/09/23 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 1;63(17):5526-31.,"['0 (N-(succinyl-beta-alanyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-L-leucyl)doxorubicin)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neprilysin/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Prodrugs/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a novel variant t(5;14) whereby NKX2-5, a related (NK-like family) homeobox gene located approximately 2 Mb telomeric of TLX3, juxtaposes BCL11B in a subset of T-cell ALL cell lines. In this t(5;14) variant, NKX2-5 is expressed instead of TLX3 at both RNA and protein levels. Subsequent expression screening failed to detect involvement of additional NK-like genes in T-cell ALL cells.

Acad. Sci. USA, 94:2551-2556, 1997). In addition, transgenic MRP8-PMLRARA mice exhibited a skin phenotype characteristic of vitamin A deficiency. The severity of the skin phenotype and spontaneous papilloma development correlated with the level of transgene expression. Papilloma formation was preceded by follicular hyperplasia and the expression of epidermal differentiation markers in the follicular epithelium. Mutations in the Ha or Ki alleles of ras were not detected in papillomas that developed on transgenic skin, and papilloma formation was accentuated on the C57/Bl6 background, unlike the usual resistance of this strain to skin tumor induction. Analysis of liver extracts from transgenic mice indicated a deficiency in the production of retinoic acid. Furthermore, affected transgenic epidermis had reduced levels of retinoic acid receptoralpha (RARalpha) and retinoic X receptor (RXRalpha), and supplementation with exogenous retinoic acid prevented the skin phenotype. When transgenic keratinocytes were grafted to nude mice, the resulting integument was normal, and conversely, when transgenic bone marrow was grafted to normal mice, a skin phenotype did not develop. Together these results suggest that local interruption of PML and RARalpha signaling in the skin, together with a systemic retinoid deficiency, initiates a tumor induction pathway that is independent of ras activation.","['Hansen, Laura A', 'Brown, Diane', 'Virador, Victoria', 'Tanaka, Takemi', 'Andreola, Fausto', 'Strain, Kathryn', 'Dancheck, Barbara', 'Riley, Rebeccah', 'Arbeit, Jeffrey M', 'De Luca, Luigi M', 'Kogan, Scott', 'Yuspa, Stuart H']","['Hansen LA', 'Brown D', 'Virador V', 'Tanaka T', 'Andreola F', 'Strain K', 'Dancheck B', 'Riley R', 'Arbeit JM', 'De Luca LM', 'Kogan S', 'Yuspa SH']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2003/09/23 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Sep 1;63(17):5257-65.,"['0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinyl Esters)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1D1K0N0VVC (retinol palmitate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calgranulin A/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Diterpenes', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hair Follicle/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Papilloma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Retinyl Esters', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transgenes', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are, however, species differences in receptor specificity and receptor crossreactivity in the gp130-gp130 ligand system. We asked whether gp130 signaling is also involved in the regulation of VEGF in human cardiac myocytes and if so which gp130 ligands are critical for such an effect. METHODS: Human adult cardiac myocytes (HACMs) were isolated from myocardial tissue and characterised by positive staining for myocardial actin, troponin-I and cardiotin. HACMs were treated with the gp130 ligands CT-1, IL-6, LIF or OSM and VEGF-1 was determined by a specific ELISA in the conditioned media of these cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was used in order to detect gp130, IL-6-receptor, LIF-receptor or OSM-receptor specific protein and mRNA in human adult cardiac myocytes and for detection of VEGF-1 specific mRNA in cardiac myocytes after incubation with OSM. Pieces of myocardial tissue were incubated ex vivo in the presence and absence of OSM and VEGF was determined in supernatants of these cultures and immunohistochemistry was performed on the tissue using specific antibodies for VEGF-1. Immunohistochemistry was also employed to detect VEGF in sections from a healthy human heart and in a heart from a patient suffering from acute myocarditis. RESULTS: OSM, but not CT-1, IL-6 or LIF increased VEGF-1 production in human adult cardiac myocytes dose-dependently derived from five different donors. This selective stimulation of VEGF by gp130 ligands was also reflected by a specific receptor expression on these cells. We detected high levels of mRNA for gp130 and the OSM receptor in freshly isolated human cardiac myocytes but only low amounts of mRNA for the IL-6 receptor whereas mRNA for the LIF receptor was hardly detectable by RT-PCR. OSM receptor and IL-6 receptor were also detectable by Western blotting whereas LIF receptor was only present as a faint band. OSM also increased the expression of VEGF-1 mRNA in cardiac myocytes. When pieces of human myocardial tissue were incubated with the gp130 ligands in an ex vivo model only OSM resulted in an increase in VEGF-1 in the supernatants of these cultures. Furthermore, VEGF increased in tissue samples treated with OSM in cardiac myocytes as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we found increased VEGF-1 expression in myocardial tissue from a patient suffering from acute myocarditis. CONCLUSION: The gp130-gp130 ligand system is also involved in VEGF regulation in human cardiac myocytes and OSM is the gp130 ligand responsible for this effect in the human system whereas LIF and CT-1 which had been shown to regulate VEGF expression in mouse and rat cardiac myocytes had no effect. Thus we have added OSM, which is produced by activated T lymphocytes and monocytes, to the list of regulatory molecules of VEGF production in the human heart. Our results lend further support to the notion that besides hypoxia, inflammation via induction of VEGF through autocrine or paracrine pathways plays a key role in (re)vascularisation of the myocardium.","['Weiss, Thomas W', 'Speidl, Walter S', 'Kaun, Christoph', 'Rega, Gersina', 'Springer, Christopher', 'Macfelda, Karin', 'Losert, Udo M', 'Grant, Susan L', 'Marro, Martin L', 'Rhodes, Andrew D', 'Fuernkranz, Alexander', 'Bialy, Jan', 'Ullrich, Robert', 'Holzmann, Philipp', 'Pacher, Richard', 'Maurer, Gerald', 'Huber, Kurt', 'Wojta, Johann']","['Weiss TW', 'Speidl WS', 'Kaun C', 'Rega G', 'Springer C', 'Macfelda K', 'Losert UM', 'Grant SL', 'Marro ML', 'Rhodes AD', 'Fuernkranz A', 'Bialy J', 'Ullrich R', 'Holzmann P', 'Pacher R', 'Maurer G', 'Huber K', 'Wojta J']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0008636303004632 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00463-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2003 Sep 1;59(3):628-38. doi: 10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00463-2.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC22A5 protein, human)', '0 (Slc22a5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (glycoprotein 130, human)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Molecular Chaperones/pharmacology', 'Myocarditis/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', '*Organic Cation Transport Proteins', 'Peptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cellular stress agents have been shown to elevate ceramide, the basic precursor of all sphingolipids, initiating a cascade of events leading to arrest of the cell cycle, apoptosis and cell death. Aiming at inhibiting metabolic pathways of sphingolipid metabolism that might lead to an increase of cellular ceramide, we have synthesized non-natural analogs of ceramide, sphingosine and trimethylsphingosine. When the respective analogs were applied to HL60 human myeloid leukemic cells they inhibited the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin (SPM) and glycosphingolipids and induced apoptosis that led to cell death.

These results suggest that the newly synthesized sphingolipid analogs might be valuable for potential application as a therapeutic modality in leukemia and other malignancies.","['Dagan, Arie', 'Wang, Chunbo', 'Fibach, Eitan', 'Gatt, Shimon']","['Dagan A', 'Wang C', 'Fibach E', 'Gatt S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel. dagan@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,2003/09/23 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1388198103001227 [pii]', '10.1016/s1388-1981(03)00122-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Sep 22;1633(3):161-9. doi: 10.1016/s1388-1981(03)00122-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Sphingolipids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sphingolipids/*biosynthesis/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['5R03TW01372-03/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the main disadvantages of the drug are (1) the need for frequent intramuscular injection and (2) a very high rate of allergic reactions. Because of this, L-asparaginase seemed like an ideal target for pegylation and PEG-L-asparaginase was developed in the 1970s and 1980s. The drug has undergone extensive testing and appears to retain its antileukemic effectiveness while allowing less frequent administration than the native compound. While the actual cost to patients for PEG-L-asparaginase is greater than that of multiple injections of other L-asparaginases, the reduced need for physician visits and treatment of complications of therapy may make overall treatment costs considerably less than that of the conventional L-asparaginases.

We found seven genes by exon trapping, cDNA screening and analysis/cDNA extension of known expressed sequence tags. One appeared to originate from another region of 13q. Recent publications have focused on two of the genes that most likely do not have a tumor suppressor role. This study evaluates the remaining four genes in the region by mutation scanning and theoretical analysis of putative encoded products. No mutations suggestive of a pathogenic effect were found. The 13q14 deletions may be a consequence of an inherent instability of the region, an idea supported by our finding of a considerable proportion of AluY repeats. Deletion of putative enhancer sequences and/or genes in the region may result in an inactivation of tumor suppression by a haploinsufficiency mechanism.

Intriguingly, recent studies have strongly implicated ATM in the pathogenesis of T-PLL as a tumor suppressor gene, because biallelic inactivation of ATM is frequently observed in this disease; however, translocations involving 11q23 have rarely been reported in T-PLL. We report here a case of T-PLL with der(11)t(1;11)(q21;q23). Southern blot analysis did not reveal any abnormality of ATM, nor of MLL, which is also located on 11q23 and is involved in t(1;11)(q21;q23) in acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Northern blot analysis further showed that the ATM transcript of normal size is expressed in the leukemic cells at a level higher than that in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Western blot analysis, however, revealed that expression of ATM in the leukemic cells is much lower than that in normal lymphocytes. These results imply that translation of the ATM transcript is impaired or that the ATM protein is highly unstable in the leukemic cells, thus suggesting the presence of nucleotide changes in both alleles.","['Yamaguchi, Mitsuko', 'Yamamoto, Koh', 'Miki, Tohru', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Miki T', 'Mizutani S', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,2003/09/23 05:00,2003/11/06 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460803001043 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00104-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Oct 1;146(1):22-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00104-3.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of resistance to these molecules is one of the major reasons for treatment failure. The overexpression of the membrane transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is among the principal mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. This pump, which is responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, decreases the toxicity of a wide range of unrelated anticancer drugs by increasing their cellular efflux. Structure-activity relationship experiments have shown that the positively charged amino group of the anthracyclines could be responsible for their transport by P-gp. Here, we used three new anthracyclines that shared the same chromophore but differed by the degree of N-methylation of their sugar moiety. Oxaunomycin (OXN) possessed a non-methylated amino group, while LB-1 was monomethylated and beta-clamycin T (BCT) was dimethylated. In sensitive cells (FLC), reduced cytotoxicity was related to the level of N-methylation; whereas in resistant cells (DOX-RFLC(1) and DOX-RFLC(2)) overexpressing different levels of P-gp, increased N-methylation enhanced anthracycline cytotoxicity. Decreased resistance in DOX-RFLCs was associated with an increased drug accumulation due to a reduced cellular efflux. As expected, the MDR modulator verapamil decreased resistance to these anthracyclines by increasing the cellular accumulation. These results suggest that N-methylation of anthracyclines circumvents resistance by diminishing drug transport by P-gp in MDR-positive cells. These observations could be the consequence of the steric hindrance created by the methyl group(s) which may impair the interaction between the positively charged amino group and the active site of P-gp.","['Gate, L', 'Couvreur, P', 'Nguyen-Ba, G', 'Tapiero, H']","['Gate L', 'Couvreur P', 'Nguyen-Ba G', 'Tapiero H']","['UMR-CNRS 8612, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Paris XI, 92290 Chatenay-Malabry cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,2003/09/23 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/09/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0753332203000374 [pii]', '10.1016/s0753-3322(03)00037-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2003 Sep;57(7):301-8. doi: 10.1016/s0753-3322(03)00037-4.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the acute stages of their illness, all twenty-three patients showed a very marked difference in their seromucoid pattern as contrasted to the control group, both groups being comparable in age, sex, and race. As the patients recovered, their seromucoid patterns returned to that of the control group. Three patients with bilateral pneumococcal pneumonia showed seromucoid patterns similar to those of the twenty-three patients with unilateral pneumococcal pneumonia. Five individuals with viral pneumonia showed a seromucoid pattern similar to those observed in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The data suggested that the seromucoid pattern observed in pneumonia depended upon the stage of the disease of the patient, different patterns being observed during the acute, convalescent, and complete recovery stages. Each stage showed a characteristic pattern. The seromucoid pattern of seven patients with acute leukemia differed from that of the control groups and also differed from that observed in patients with pneumonia. Five individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed seromucoid patterns which could not be distinguished from those of the control group in spite of the fact that all showed clinical signs of disease at the time the blood sample was drawn for fractionation.","['PRICE, W H', 'MATANOWSKI, G', 'PREWER, A', 'REACTOR, L']","['PRICE WH', 'MATANOWSKI G', 'PREWER A', 'REACTOR L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,1962/03/01 00:00,1962/03/01 00:01,['1962/03/01 00:00'],"['1962/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1962/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1962/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.45.4.205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1962 Mar;45(4)Pt 2:205-21. doi: 10.1085/jgp.45.4.205.,"['0 (Mucoproteins)', '0 (Orosomucoid)']",OM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Mucoproteins/*blood', '*Orosomucoid', 'Pneumonia/*blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2195206,,['NLM'],"['*LEUKEMIA/blood', '*MUCOPROTEINS/blood', '*PNEUMONIA/blood']"

In the management of Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and lymphoma, chemotherapy is a useful and accepted form of therapy. In many cases radiation and chemotherapy are interdependent. In disseminated carcinomas arising in the lung, ovary or breast, there is less likelihood of significant improvement with the use of chemotherapy, but if the disease is not amenable to radiotherapy, useful palliation can be obtained at times. While newer chemotherapeutic agents for cancer, notably the pyrimidine analogues, have a broader spectrum of antitumor effects than others investigated earlier, they should be regarded as providing a valuable research stimulus in the continued search for more effective and less toxic agents.","['PAPAC, R J', 'WOOD, D A']","['PAPAC RJ', 'WOOD DA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Calif Med,California medicine,0410260,1962/06/01 00:00,1962/06/01 00:01,['1962/06/01 00:00'],"['1962/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1962/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1962/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Calif Med. 1962 Jun;96:420-5.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],OM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapy', 'Female', '*Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1575405,,['NLM'],['*ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS/therapy']

An important point to be noted when attempting to extrapolate from animal experiments to man is that, whereas the levels of leukaemia incidence open to experimental investigation lie between 5% and 100%, the mechanisms important to man are those concerned with levels of incidence of 1: 1000 or 1: 10 000. Moreover, since the human and murine diseases are not identical, the relevance of experimental work to the human problem depends on the definition of leukaemia.Experimental work suggests that the incidence of radiation-induced leukaemia depends as much on the particular conditions of irradiation as on the total radiation dose received.","['MOLE, R H']",['MOLE RH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bull World Health Organ,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,7507052,1962/01/01 00:00,1962/01/01 00:01,['1962/01/01 00:00'],"['1962/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1962/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1962/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull World Health Organ. 1962;26:613-8.,,OM,"['Animals', '*Hematologic Diseases', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Leukemia, Experimental', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Radiation Injuries, Experimental']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2555773,,['NLM'],"['*BLOOD DISEASES/experimental', '*LEUKEMIA/experimental', '*RADIATION INJURY/experimental']"

However, studies attempting to relate leukaemia mortality to variation in levels of natural radioactivity might to advantage be confined, for the moment, to areas in which differences in natural radioactivity levels are substantial. The investigation of certain groups of patients exposed to ionizing radiation from medical sources is also important to an understanding of the etiology of leukaemia.There are other groups in which the leukaemia experience is unusual and which might form the basis for further investigation. These include mongolian idiots and their relatives, children aged 3-4 years, children in certain maternal age and parity groups, certain segments of the population of Israel, and persons occupationally exposed to benzol.","['MACMAHON, B']",['MACMAHON B'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bull World Health Organ,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,7507052,1962/01/01 00:00,1962/01/01 00:01,['1962/01/01 00:00'],"['1962/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1962/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1962/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull World Health Organ. 1962;26:579-84.,,OM,"['Child', 'Female', '*Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2555778,,['NLM'],['*LEUKEMIA/epidemiology']

The data available on leukaemias in man are equivocal so far as the role of genetic factors is involved.
