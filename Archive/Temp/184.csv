This configuration is retained in benign and malignant neoplasms derived therefrom. The choroid plexus was involved in the pathological process of leukemic cell infiltration in one case reported here and in chronic cryptococcal leptomeningitis in the other case. The epithelial cells of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle were arranged extensively in a tubular (acinar) configuration, in association with remarkable stromal fibrosis caused by an infiltration of leukemic or inflammatory cells. In addition, choroid plexus epithelial cells in the first case contained a moderate amount of intracytoplasmic glycogen. These two cases indicate that the non-neoplastic choroid plexus epithelium can undergo transformation into a tubular (acinar) structure as a response or adaptation to the fibrotic processes of the stroma. This finding should be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma.

RESULTS: The hematological manifestations can be conveniently categorized into the broad areas of; anemia, particularly NSAID induced iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease, neutropenia, particularly Felty's syndrome and the large granular lymphocyte syndrome and drug induced neutropenia; thrombocytopenia, particularly autoimmune and drug induced thrombocytopenia; and hematological malignancy. Rarer conditions, their diagnosis and therapy are also described in this review. CONCLUSION: Hematological manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis are very common.

The patch clamp method in cell-attached configuration was used to search for the effects of amiloride and gadolinium (Gd3+) exerted on two types of voltage-insensitive cationic channels in plasma membrane of human leukemia K562 cells: Na-selective channels activated by actin disassembly, and mechanosensitive channels. Here we demonstrate that amiloride in high concentrations (1 mM) caused a full inhibition of mechanosensitive channels in K562 cells similarly to Gd3+ effect in micromolecular concentration range. Na-selective channels controlled by actin dynamics were shown to be unaffected by Gd3+ similarly as by amiloride. We also found that application of amiloride to the extracellular surface of membrane patch resulted in a significant increase in the activity of sodium channels. This unexpected stimulatory effect of amiloride may represent an unknown mechanism of activation of non-voltage-gated sodium channels. The data show an essential difference of the activation and blockage of these types of cation-selective channels.","['Starushchenko, A V', 'Neguliaev, Iu A', 'Morachevskaia, E Z']","['Starushchenko AV', 'Neguliaev IuA', 'Morachevskaia EZ']","['Institute of Cytology RAS, St. Petersburg. star@mail.cytspb.rssi.ru']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,IM,"['Amiloride/*pharmacology', 'Gadolinium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ion Channels/*drug effects/physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects']",2002/11/29 04:00,2003/01/17 04:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2002;44(7):676-80.,,Ingibiruiushchee i stimuliruiushchee deistvie amilorida na potentsialnezavisimye kationnye kanaly v kletkakh K562.,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pgp-mediated resistance can be modulated by coadministration with the highly potent, selective inhibitor, LY335979. Modulation of resistance by mitoxantrone and vinorelbine, 2 drugs used to treat certain solid tumors, was examined in a 3-day cytotoxicity assay using a panel of HL60 leukemia cell lines or MCF-7 breast cancer transfectants. LY335979, at 0.5 microM, substantially reversed mitoxantrone resistance and fully reversed vinorelbine resistance of Pgp-expressing HL60/Vinc cells. However, LY335979 did not modulate drug resistance in the MRP1-expressing HL60/ADR or drug-sensitive parental HL60 cells. To ascertain if LY335979 modulates BCRP-mediated drug resistance, the sensitivity of 26-fold mitoxantrone resistant, BCRP-transfected MCF-7 cells was evaluated. Addition of 5 microM LY335979, a concentration approximately 100-fold higher than the affinity of Pgp, had little to no effect on the BCRP transfectant. [(125)I]Iodomycin photolabeled Pgp in CEM/VLB(100) membranes and was inhibited by 5 microM LY335979 and GF120918. No photolabeling of MRP or BCRP occurred in H69AR or MCF-7/BCRP membranes, respectively. These results further demonstrate that LY335979 is highly specific for Pgp and does not modulate MRP1- or BCRP-mediated resistance and can be used in combination with mitoxantrone and vinorelbine in tumor cells.","['Shepard, Robert L', 'Cao, Jin', 'Starling, James J', 'Dantzig, Anne H']","['Shepard RL', 'Cao J', 'Starling JJ', 'Dantzig AH']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA.

These include relative rapid assay times (hours), reliability and ease of performing replicate analyses. In contrast, competitive PCR is a very labor-intensive procedure requiring a few days to generate useful data. We compared the same samples from CML patients by both methods. Importantly, we used the Bcr-Abl junction plasmid DNA, which is used as a competitor in the manual competitive PCR assay, to generate a standard curve for the real-time assay. This permitted reporting the real-time data as the number of BCR-ABL transcripts per microg of total RNA, which is the same format used for the competitive PCR assay. In this study, a total of 435 peripheral blood and marrow samples from 285 CML patients were analyzed by RT-PCR; these patients were undergoing therapy by STI-571, interferon, and bone marrow transplantation treatment. Most samples also had assay values for the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), FISH and Western blotting for the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. Our findings indicated that the real-time assay was less sensitive than the manual competitive RT-PCR assay (t = 5.118; P < 0.001). Of interest, the transcript levels in cell line mixtures with various ratios of K562/KG-1 (BCR-ABL positive/negative) cells were also significantly higher with the competitive RT-PCR assays than real-time RT-PCR, except for levels of BCR-ABL below 200 transcripts per microg of RNA. In both patient and cell line experiments, dividing the BCR-ABL transcripts by the total ABL transcripts virtually eliminated the difference between real-time BCR-ABL transcript values and quantitative competitive BCR-ABL transcript values, indicating that both BCR-ABL and ABL transcripts were underestimated by the real-time assay. In addition, the increased sensitivity of the nested, competitive RT-PCR was readily apparent in patients with minimal residual disease, which by the real-time were negative in the majority of patients but were positive by nested, competitive RT-PCR in 44.6% (n = 29) of samples analyzed (n = 65). These findings indicate that real-time RT-PCR, when normalized for the total ABL transcripts, can be used to monitor CML patients during therapy, but we suggest that nested, competitive RT-PCR be used to determine BCR-ABL/ABL transcript ratios at low transcript values or especially when real-time analyses are negative.","['Guo, J Q', 'Lin, H', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Champlin, R', 'Andreeff, M', 'Glassman, A', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Guo JQ', 'Lin H', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M', 'Champlin R', 'Andreeff M', 'Glassman A', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402730 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Dec;16(12):2447-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402730.,,,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2527-8; author reply 2528-31.

Current data from gene profiling expression have failed to demonstrate a clear-cut distinction between these two forms of B-CLL disease. In the present study, we have investigated the complete V(H) nucleotide sequence and the presence of RNA transcripts from different C(H) domains in 25 B-CLL patients. Our results demonstrate that: (1) expression of IgD is not related to the mutational frequency and activation of the isotype switch pathway; (2) isotype switch, leading to simultaneous expression at the transcriptional and protein level of IgM, IgD, IgG and IgA, occurs in a small percentage of patients, and (3) different mechanisms such as VDJ duplication and trans-splicing or RNA splicing of long nuclear transcript, could be involved in isotype switch.

Of 6790 genes examined, we identified 87 genes that were differentially expressed at least two-fold between CLL and the normal B cells. CLL cells significantly down-regulated transcripts from CD1c and CD1d genes, which encode proteins known to present lipid antigen and mediate innate and adaptive immunity. The expression pattern was also consistent with reduced signaling by interferon gamma but increased response to interleukin 4 in leukemic cells. CLL cells increased the expression of several collagen-associated extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules, up-regulated many genes involved in intracellular protein transport and processing, while downregulating genes involved in proliferation and metabolism. Based on the expression pattern, we propose that CLL-B cells prolong their survival through increased interaction with survival factors such as IL-4, and through various mechanisms of evading the immune response, such as turning off the expression of CD1c and CD1d, reducing immunogenic response to interferon gamma, inactivating T cell in B-T interaction and increasing the expression of immunoglobulin receptors which neutralize antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","['Zheng, Z', 'Venkatapathy, S', 'Rao, G', 'Harrington, C A']","['Zheng Z', 'Venkatapathy S', 'Rao G', 'Harrington CA']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. zhizheng10@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD1/*genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, CD1d', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'Receptors, Interferon/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/genetics']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402711 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Dec;16(12):2429-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402711.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (CD1C protein, human)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)']",,,"['5R01CA056764-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HG01323/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involved gene on chromosome 12 is TEL; the 7q36 partner gene has not been identified. We describe morphologic, molecular and cytogenetic characterization of two cases of 7q36/12p13-associated AML that provide important insights regarding the consequences of this rearrangement. First, the molecular organization of the breakpoint regions differ significantly: one case is a reciprocal 7;12 translocation (RTR); the other has an insertion of 7q into 12p (INS). While 12p13 breakpoints in both patients interrupt TEL intron 1, the centromere to telomere orientation of the 7q36 sequences relative to the TEL sequences are inverted in INS compared to RTR. This difference makes it difficult to postulate a mechanism whereby both patients could produce a common fusion transcript. Further, no evidence was obtained for any TEL-containing fusion transcripts. Finally, we report the first cloning of a 7;12 genomic breakpoint (from RTR) and find that it maps to a site 30 kbp proximal to the HLXB9 gene in 7q36. Together, these data suggest that, unlike most leukemia-associated chromosomal rearrangements, the important consequence of the t(7;12) is likely not the generation of a novel fusion transcript, but instead the inactivation of TEL and/or a gene at 7q36.","['Simmons, H M', 'Oseth, L', 'Nguyen, P', ""O'Leary, M"", 'Conklin, K F', 'Hirsch, B']","['Simmons HM', 'Oseth L', 'Nguyen P', ""O'Leary M"", 'Conklin KF', 'Hirsch B']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402773 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Dec;16(12):2408-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402773.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, degradation may lead to inaccurate estimates of MRD in positive specimens. We sought to determine feasibility and efficacy of a novel blood collection and processing system which is based on integrated RNA stabilization at the time of phlebotomy (PAXgene Blood RNA Kit) by comparison with standard methods of RNA extraction (cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation and RNeasy Mini Kit) using unstabilized EDTA anticoagulated PB. In 26 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) on therapy, PB was processed after a storage time at room temperature of 2 and 72 h according to these protocols. BCR-ABL, total ABL and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mRNA transcripts of PB samples were quantified as a measure for response to therapy and RNA integrity. RNA yield expressed as the ratio of ABL transcripts after a storage time of 72 h/ABL transcripts after a storage time of 2 h at room temperature was significantly higher with the stabilizing method (median 0.40) compared to the RNeasy method using unstabilized PB (median 0.13, P = 0.01). Furthermore, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL after 72 vs 2 h still correlated well using the PAXgene method (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001) in contrast to the standard method which did not (r = 0.65, P = 0.03). Even investigation of complete cytogenetic responders with very low tumor burden showed a good correlation of ratios BCR-ABL/ABL compared to the reference method. Comparable results were achieved using G6PD transcripts as standard.

This may result from defective MTX accumulation due to alterations in the human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) gene. We have identified an hRFC gene point mutation in a transport-defective CCRF-CEM human T-ALL cell line resulting in a lysine to glutamic acid substitution at codon 45 (E45K), which has been identified in other antifolate-resistant sublines (JBC 273:30 189, 1998; JBC 275:30 855, 2000). To characterize the role of this mutation in MTX resistance, transfection experiments were performed using hRFC-null CCRF-CEM cells. E45K transfectants demonstrated an initial rate of MTX influx that was approximately 0.5-fold that of CCRF-CEM cells, despite marked protein overexpression. Cytotoxicity studies revealed partial reversal of MTX and raltitrexed resistance in E45K transfectants, while trimetrexate resistance was significantly increased. Kinetic analysis indicated only minor differences in MTX kinetics between wild-type and E45K hRFCs, however, K(i)s for folic acid and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were markedly reduced for E45K hRFC. This was paralleled by increased folic acid transport and reduced synthesis of MTX polyglutamates. Collectively, the results demonstrate that expression of E45K hRFC leads to increased MTX resistance due to decreased membrane transport and, secondarily, from alterations in binding affinities and transport of folate substrates. However, despite these findings, we could find no evidence of this mutation in 121 childhood ALL samples, suggesting that it does not contribute to clinical MTX resistance in this disease.","['Gifford, A J', 'Haber, M', 'Witt, T L', 'Whetstine, J R', 'Taub, J W', 'Matherly, L H', 'Norris, M D']","['Gifford AJ', 'Haber M', 'Witt TL', 'Whetstine JR', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Folic Acid/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2001/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402655 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Dec;16(12):2379-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402655.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,"['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further aims were to compare karyotypic features of t-AML/t-MDS with de novo AML/MDS, in our material as well as in 5098 unselected, cyto- genetically abnormal, published cases, and to analyze associations between type of prior therapy and karyotype. Among our 372 AML and 389 MDS, 47 (13%) were t-AML and 62 (16%) were t-MDS. Clonal abnormalities were significantly more common in t-AML and t-MDS than in de novo disease (68% vs 50%, P < 0.05 and 84% vs 45%, P < 0.001, respectively). Among the available 4230 AML and 1629 MDS (the present series and published cases), 14% were t-AML and 15% were t-MDS. In t-AML/t-MDS, the number of anomalies and the ploidy levels differed significantly from de novo cases, with complex and hypodiploid karyotypes being more common in t-AML/t-MDS. In t-AML, unbalanced changes in general, t(1;3), der(1;7), 3p-, -5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, t(9;11), t(11;19), t(11q23), der(12p), -17, der(17p), -18, and -21 were significantly more frequent than in de novo AML. In t-MDS, -5, -7, 7q-, 13q-, der(17p), and -18 were significantly more common. Type of prior treatment correlated significantly with number of anomalies in t-AML and with ploidy levels in t-AML/t-MDS. The frequencies of several aberrations varied with type of therapy, eg, 5q- was more frequent in radiotherapy-associated t-MDS, monosomy 7 was more common in t-AML and t-MDS after treatment with alkylators, and t(11q23) in t-AML was associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors. Abnormalities significantly more common in de novo disease were +8 as a sole anomaly, balanced changes in general, t(8;21), t(9;22), t(15;17), inv(16), and t(21q22) in AML, and -Y, 5q-, and 20q- as sole anomalies and +8 in MDS.

To determine whether imatinib may facilitate allogeneic SCT in relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL, we evaluated 46 consecutive, not previously transplanted patients who were enrolled in phase II studies of imatinib. Of 30 patients eligible for SCT, 22 (73%) were actually transplanted. Ten patients were in complete hematologic remission (CHR) (n = 5) or had a complete marrow response (CMR) (n = 5) at the time of SCT, 12 patients had again relapsed or were refractory. After SCT, 18 patients were in complete remission, one patient was refractory, three patients died prior to response assessment. Seven patients (32%) are in ongoing complete remission with a median follow-up of 9.4 (range 1.7-23.8) months. Seven patients (32%) relapsed a median of 5.2 months after SCT. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 36%. Probability of disease-free survival (DFS) is 25.5 +/- 9.8% overall and 51.4 +/- 17.7% when SCT was performed in CHR or CMR, compared with 8.3 +/- 8% for SCT during overt leukemia (P = 0.06). In conclusion, imatinib is a well-tolerated salvage therapy prior to allogeneic SCT in patients with Ph+ALL, but requires that SCT be performed within a few weeks of starting treatment to avoid resistance.

The drug shows great efficacy in chronic phase, but is less effective in maintaining hematologic remissions in blast crisis patients. Our group has previously described several cell lines made resistant to imatinib. We now examine the question of cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic drugs used in CML. Four paired imatinib-sensitive/resistant CML cell lines were assessed by caspase-3 and MTS assays for their proliferative response to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), daunorubicin (DNR), homoharringtonine (HHT) and hydroxyurea (HU), either alone or in combination with imatinib. Primary blasts from advanced-stage CML patients refractory to imatinib therapy were studied by semi-solid media clonogenic assays. We found that these drugs are generally capable of major inhibition of proliferation of the CML cell lines, although differential responses to DNR and HHT were noted between some sensitive and resistant cell line pairs, implying that resistance to imatinib may confer a growth advantage under such conditions. The four drugs were also effective in preventing the formation of progenitor cell colonies from CML patients both before treatment with imatinib, and after relapse on the drug. Isobolographic analysis implied that these drugs will generally combine well with imatinib, and in some cases will be synergistic. We conclude that Ara-C, DNR or HHT, either alone or in combination with imatinib, are likely to be the best therapeutic alternatives in the management of patients who become resistant to imatinib monotherapy.","['Tipping, A J', 'Mahon, F X', 'Zafirides, G', 'Lagarde, V', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Tipping AJ', 'Mahon FX', 'Zafirides G', 'Lagarde V', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Dept of Haematology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402775 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Dec;16(12):2349-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402775.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of alkylating agents seems to be associated with an increased risk of leukemic transformation of PV. Hypercalcemia is a serious complication of malignancies, but it is uncommon in acute leukemia. In the majority of malignancies with hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is thought to be the main cause of hypercalcemia. We report a rare case of megakaryoblastic transformation of PV with hypercalcemia. A 62-year-old man was diagnosed as having PV in 1983, and he had received ranimustine and busulfan. He developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia 17 years after the initial diagnosis of PV. Serum calcium was elevated, the serum level of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was suppressed, and the level of intact PTHrP was slightly elevated. He had no lytic bone lesions; however, uncoupling of bone turnover due to an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone formation was detected by using biochemical markers. Since the level of PTHrP was slightly elevated from the normal value, we speculated that PTHrP produced in the local field by leukemic cells might have been more abundant than circulating PTHrP. Pamidronate and adrenocortical hormone were effective in reducing the serum calcium level. However, the patient died shortly after the start of induction chemotherapy. The prognosis of cases of PV that has transformed into acute leukemia is generally poor because the majority of such cases are refractory to chemotherapy.","['Kurosawa, M', 'Iwasaki, H']","['Kurosawa M', 'Iwasaki H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Kosei Hospital, Kita-3, Higashi-8, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-0033, Japan. mikurosawa5211@ ima.me-h.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/administration & dosage', 'Bone Resorption/diagnosis/etiology', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Diphosphonates/administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/blood/*complications/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Pamidronate', 'Parathyroid Hormone/blood', '*Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proteins']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/03/20 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2001/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0543-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Nov;81(11):668-71. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0543-7.

In this study we tested two molecular markers in bone marrow of MDS patients: Galpha16, a hematopoiesis-specific G protein alpha subunit serving as an intracellular marker of hematopoietic activity, and 5'-lipoxygenase (5-LO), a putative differentiation marker. The results were correlated with clinical and laboratory features and outcome. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were evaluated by block cycler PCR in 32 patients for Galpha16 and in 25 patients for 5-LO. In 12 patients cDNA analyzed by the block cycler method was quantified by real-time quantitative (RTQ) PCR for both Galpha16 and 5-LO. The results confirmed concordance of the two methods. All FAB and WHO subtypes were positive for at least one of the two genes. Strikingly, only 1 of 11 patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts was positive for Galpha16. No correlation between Galpha16 or 5-LO and bone marrow cellularity or cytogenetic risk factors (IPSS) was detected. Only combined evaluation of Galpha16 and 5-LO expression showed a correlation with extent of anemia and thrombocytopenia. A relationship between the two markers and preleukemic duration was found. Our findings show that both Galpha16 and 5-LO can be expressed in MDS, reflecting proliferation and differentiation processes in this disease. Different expression patterns of the two molecules indicate that proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells may occur independently. These parameters could constitute a new class of risk factors in MDS.

Recent studies on patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed increased levels of leukocyte-associated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neovascularization of the bone marrow. Murine (32D, M1) and human (HEL, U937, and UKE-1) leukemic cell lines and freshly isolated leukemic cells were analyzed for the expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor mRNA. The expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors KDR and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) was detected in these cells. In a murine chloroma model, delivery of VEGF(165) using microencapsulation technology resulted in enhanced tumor growth and vascularization, whereas treatment with a VEGF antagonist soluble NRP-1 (sNRP-1) inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth. In a systemic leukemia model, survival of mice injected with adenovirus (Ad) encoding for Fc-sNRP-1 (sNRP-1 dimer) was significantly prolonged as compared with mice injected with Ad-LacZ. Further analyses showed a reduction in circulating leukemic cells and infiltration of liver and spleen as well as bone marrow neovascularization and cellularity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that angiogenic factors such as VEGF promote AML progression in vivo. The use of VEGF antagonists as an antiangiogenesis approach offers a potential treatment for AML. Finally, our novel in vivo drug delivery model may be useful for testing the activities of other peptide antiangiogenic factors.","['Schuch, Gunter', 'Machluf, Marcelle', 'Bartsch, Georg Jr', 'Nomi, Masashi', 'Richard, Henri', 'Atala, Anthony', 'Soker, Shay']","['Schuch G', 'Machluf M', 'Bartsch G Jr', 'Nomi M', 'Richard H', 'Atala A', 'Soker S']","[""Department of Urology, Laboratory for Cellular Therapeutics, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*physiopathology', 'Neuropilin-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solubility', 'Swine', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V100.13.4622 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53673-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4622-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.V100.13.4622.,,,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of MTHFR C677T and the influence of genotype on methotrexate (MTX) toxicity in patients with acute leukemia undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. Seventy-eight patients were analyzed and 61 were evaluable for toxicity. MTX toxicity was assessed on bone marrow, liver and mucosae. RESULTS: The incidence of the C677T mutation was as expected in the general Italian population with 23.08% of patients being TT, 38.46% of patients CT and 38.46% of patients CC. The TT genotype was significantly associated with an increase of toxicity during MTX administration. No specific pattern of toxicity was detected, although in TT patients myelosuppression and liver toxicity were more pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: TT genotype may indicate a need to reduce the dose of MTX during prolonged administration. Considering the high prevalence of homozygous individuals in the Italian population, pretreatment screening may be worthwhile.","['Chiusolo, P', 'Reddiconto, G', 'Casorelli, I', 'Laurenti, L', 'Sora, F', 'Mele, L', 'Annino, L', 'Leone, G', 'Sica, S']","['Chiusolo P', 'Reddiconto G', 'Casorelli I', 'Laurenti L', 'Sora F', 'Mele L', 'Annino L', 'Leone G', 'Sica S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Divisione di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore Roma, Italy. emacat@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf322 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)47206-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Dec;13(12):1915-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf322.,,,"['EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of PB-FISH were compared with those of CCA and interphase FISH on bone marrow aspirates (BM-FISH). PB-FISH analysis was combined with CD3 immunophenotyping that allowed simultaneous investigation of the leukemic status of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and scoring CD3(-) cells for BCR/ABL fusion gene. Moreover, the frequency of BCR/ABL fusion in nonlymphoid PB cells was estimated according to the differential leukocyte counts. The incidence of BCR/ABL(+) fusion signals in CD3(+) T cells of CML patients was 5.3% (SD +/- 1.9) and did not exceed the normal cut-off value of 8%.

Correction of PB-FISH results to include only nonlymphoid or CD3(-) cells reduced the mean of differences and improved agreement between PB-FISH and CCA or BM-FISH methods. The best agreement was noted between CCA and PB-FISH on nonlymphoid cells. On the other hand, results of BM-FISH agreed well with those of PB-FISH on CD3(-) cells. These findings imply that PB-FISH on nonlymphoid or CD3(-) cells is reliable and may replace BM analysis for monitoring of response to treatment in CML patients.","['Akel, S', 'Kolialexi, A', 'Mavrou, A', 'Metaxotou, C', 'Loukopoulos, D', 'Yataganas, X']","['Akel S', 'Kolialexi A', 'Mavrou A', 'Metaxotou C', 'Loukopoulos D', 'Yataganas X']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece. sakel@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['470 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2002.00470.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2002 Dec;24(6):361-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2002.00470.x.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old white man diagnosed with APL presented with bleeding diathesis. His molecular and cytogenetic studies were positive for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptoralpha (PML-RARalpha) and t(15;17) transformation. Complete molecular and cytogenetic remission was achieved with ATRA, daunorubicin, and cytarabine. Within 6 months, the patient was readmitted for investigation of severe global headaches and an ataxic gait. His peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid were positive for PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Intrathecal chemotherapy and radiation, as well as ATRA, were the main treatment modalities provided. Molecular and cytogenetic remission was again obtained. Three months later, a second relapse occurred in the CNS and the peripheral blood. DISCUSSION: APL is typically treated with anthacycline-based chemotherapy and ATRA. Approximately 85-95% of patients achieve complete remission (CR); however, the relapse rate has been reported to be about 30-40%. A thorough literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, 1966-January 2002) revealed only 54 cases of extramedullary disease, of which 35 involved the CNS. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of ATRA has improved patient survival dramatically. APL relapse, in general, has been in part attributable to repetitive or prolonged exposure to ATRA and the possibility of additional chromosomal changes, making the disease more refractory to treat. Given the evidence, one could argue that, with repeated ATRA treatment, CR duration may be shortened. However, limited data are available to guide the appropriate management of APL relapsed to the CNS with either ATRA, chemotherapy, or arsenic trioxide. In our opinion, treatment using arsenic trioxide is an unconventional option worthy of exploring.","['Burry, Lisa D', 'Seki, Jack T']","['Burry LD', 'Seki JT']","['Mt.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with an incidence of 29% is the most common paediatric malignancy, whereas acute myeloid leukaemias account for about 5%. The treatment of acute leukaemias consists of sequential therapy cycles (induction, consolidation, intensification, maintenance therapy) with different cytostatic drugs over a time period of up to 1.5-3 years. Over the last 25 years of clinical trials, a significant rise in the rate of complete remissions as well as an increase in long-term survival has been achieved. Therefore, growing attention is now focused on the long-term effects of antileukaemic treatment. Several cytostatic drugs administered in the treatment of acute leukaemia in childhood are known to cause long-term adverse effects. Anthracyclines may induce chronic cardiotoxicity, alkylating agents are likely to cause gonadal damage and secondary malignancies and the use of glucocorticoids may cause osteonecrosis. Most of the long-term adverse effects have not been analysed systematically. Approaches to minimising long-term adverse effects without jeopardising outcome have included: the design of new drugs such as a liposomal formulation of anthracyclines, the development of anthracycline-derivates with lower toxicity, the development of cardioprotective agents or, more recently, the use of targeted therapy;alternative administration schedules like continuous infusion or timed sequential therapy; and risk group stratification by the monitoring of minimal residual disease. Several attempts have been made to minimise the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines: decreasing concentrations delivered to the myocardium by either prolonging infusion time or using liposomal formulated anthracyclines or less cardiotoxic analogues, or the additional administration of cardioprotective agents. The advantage of these approaches is still controversial, but there are ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the long-term effects. The use of new diagnostic methods, such as diagnosis of minimal residual disease, which allow reduction or optimisation of dose, offer potential advantages compared with conventional treatment in terms of reducing the risk of severe long-term adverse effects. Most options for minimising long-term adverse effects have resulted from theoretical models and in vitro studies, but only some of the modalities such as the use of dexrazoxane, the continuous infusion of anthracyclines or timed sequential therapy, have been evaluated in prospective, randomised studies in patients. Future approaches to predict severe toxicity may be based upon pharmacogenetics and gene profiling.","['Langebrake, Claudia', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Ritter, Jorg']","['Langebrake C', 'Reinhardt D', 'Ritter J']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany. langebra@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Gonadal Disorders/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Osteonecrosis/chemically induced', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Vinca Alkaloids/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2002/11/28 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/11/28 04:00'],"['2002/11/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['251502 [pii]', '10.2165/00002018-200225150-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Saf. 2002;25(15):1057-77. doi: 10.2165/00002018-200225150-00002.,172,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to explore the cytogenetic feature of BAL. METHODS: The FAB subsets of fifty-six BAL cases were established by morphology/cytochemistry; and surface immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry using a broad panel of lymphoid- and myeloid-associated monoclonal antibodies through directly immunofluorescence technique; karyotype analysis was carried out by reverse heating giemsa (RHG). RESULTS: The data from our study showed that the cytogenetic feature of BAL possess a certain degrees of heterogeneity. In all cases, 44.4% were normal karyotype, 55.6% were clonal chromosome aberration. In clonal chromosome aberration, Ph chromosome abnormality occurred 23.2% and in matched AML controls was 0%. Ph chromosome abnormality occurred 39.3% in group of coexpression of myeloid and B lymphoid lineage; Ph chromosome aberration occurred 0% in group of coexpression of myeloid and T-lymphoid lineage. The other associated clonal chromosome aberrations were t (8; 21), t (15; 17), t (9; 22), inv (16), and not associated clonal chromosome aberration were t (12; 17), t (14; 15), t (3; 6), +21, complex aberration, etc. CONCLUSION: The generalized abnormality of t (9; 22) in BAL indicate that the blast cells of BAL were derived from earlier hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell.","['Shen, Yi-min', 'Li, Jian-yong', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Gu, Qing-li']","['Shen YM', 'Li JY', 'Xue YQ', 'Gu QL']","['First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, P.

METHODS: Compared with cisplatin(cDDP), the growth inhibiting rates to human ovarian cancer cell line 3AO by treatment with various concentrations of As2O3 for 48 h were determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) method. After implanted with 3AO cells 4 x 10(6) into abdominal cavity for 96 h, the nude mice were randomly divided into 5 groups and treated by intraperitoneal injection of normal saline, cisplatin, or different concentrations of As2O3. The rate of tumor formation, death rate, and survival period of tumor-bearing nude mice were evaluated. After treatment with As2O3, the changes of Fas, FasL, and nm23 gene expressions were estimated by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Compared with cisplatin, 3AO cell growth inhibiting rates by As2O3 were different significantly in concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.05); Compared with cisplatin, As2O3 could reduce the 3AO cell tumor formation rate in nude mice and the death rate of tumor-bearing nude mice, and prolong the survival period of tumor-bearing nude mice significantly (P < 0.05). As2O3 up-regulated Fas and nm23 gene expressions of abdominal cavity implanted tumors (P < 0.05), but did not affect FasL gene expression (P > 0.05).

In order to get insight into pharmalogic activity of Topo I inhibitor, this study was designed to investigate the killing and proapoptotic activity of Topo I inhibitor(Topotecan, TPT) using K562 cell line, which carry abnormal chromosome[t(9;22)] of characteristics of CML. METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of TPT on K562 cells was determined using MTT assay; TPT-induced apoptosis in K562 cells was identified by morphological analysis and Annexin V FITC staining; correlation between TPT-mediated killing or apoptosis and caspase-8 activation was investigated using caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk. RESULTS: After incubation of K562 cells with 0.15 mumol/L TPT for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, the survival rates, compared with control, progressively reduced to (92 +/- 36)% [P > 0.05 vs (94 +/- 27)%], (68 +/- 21)% [P < 0.05 vs (119 +/- 13)%], (54 +/- 15)% [P < 0.05 vs (132 +/- 31)%], and (21 +/- 10)% [P < 0.01 vs (114 +/- 19)%].

As2O3 could induce complete remission in de novo APL patients as well as in relapsed APL patients who have been resistant to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the underlying mechanisms of As2O3-induced remission remain obscure. Therefore, we designed this study to explore the possible mechanism of low dose As2O3 in treatment of the patients with APL. METHODS: The APL cell line NB4 and primary malignant cells isolated from APL patients were used as in vitro models. Cell differentiation was determined by cell morphology, NBT reduction test and cytometry assay of cell differentiation antigens. The change of PML-RAR alpha fusion protein was analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot. RESULTS: The 0.25 mumol/L As2O3 combined with cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP), had induced differentiation in NB4 cell line and primary cells. It was also found that this effect could be attenuated by H89, a specific PKA inhibitor. Moreover, 8-CPT-cAMP was able to facilitate the As2O3-mediated degradation of PML-RAR alpha.

Topotecan and cytarabine (ara-C) is an effective anti-AML regimen. A pilot study of Mylotarg combined with topotecan and ara-C (MTA) was conducted in patients with refractory AML. METHODS: MTA consisted of Mylotarg 9 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) over 2 h on day 1, ara-C 1 g/m(2) over 2 h i.v. on days 1 through 5, and topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion i.v. on days 1 through 5. RESULTS: A group of 17 patients (9 primary resistant, 8 relapsed) with AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) received 20 courses of MTA. The median age of the patients was 55 years (20-70 years). Two patients (12%) achieved complete remission. The median overall survival was 8.2 weeks. Five patients (29%) developed grade 3/4 hepatic transaminitis, including one patient (6%) who died with hepatic venoocclusive disease.

In contrast to the cytidine nucleoside analogues currently in clinical use (cytarabine and gemcitabine), troxacitabine is a poor substrate of nucleoside transporters and enters cells primarily by passive diffusion. This unusual property led us to evaluate the efficacy of troxacitabine in multidrug resistant (MDR) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) tumors. METHODS: The in vitro antiproliferative activity of troxacitabine was investigated in the human nasopharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma cell line, KB, and its vincristine-resistant derivative (KBV), as well as in human leukemia cell lines of myeloid and lymphoblastoid origin, HL60 and CCRF-CEM, respectively, and their MDR (HL60/R10 and CCRF-CEM/VLB) and MRP (HL60/ADR) derivatives, using the thymidine incorporation assay. For in vivo studies, we compared the antitumor efficacy of troxacitabine with that of doxorubicin and vinblastine in xenograft models of these solid and hematological human anthracycline-resistant tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Troxacitabine demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity against both P-glycoprotein-positive (KBV, HL60/R10, CCRF-CEM/VLB) and P-glycoprotein-negative (HL60/ADR) multidrug-resistant cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 7 to 171 n M. Tumor regression was observed in the KBV xenograft following a 5-day treatment with 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg of troxacitabine, with percent total growth inhibition (TGI) of 81, 96 and 97, respectively, and some cures at the two highest dose levels. In the HL60, HL60/R10, HL60/ADR and CCRF-CEM/VLB xenografts, the effect of troxacitabine was evaluated on survival time. In the HL60 promyelocytic human xenograft models, troxacitabine treatment (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg per day for 5 days) was initiated 10 days after tumor cell inoculation, once animals had developed disseminated tumors. In all three promyelocytic leukemia xenografts, troxacitabine was quite potent, producing T/C values of 162% to 315% as well as complete cures at the higher dose levels. In the CCRF-CEM/VLB T-lymphoblastoid leukemia xenograft, troxacitabine treatment (10, 30 or 250 mg/kg total doses using different schedules) was initiated 20 days after tumor cell inoculation. Troxacitabine was not as potent in this model but did result in significant antileukemic activity (T/C of 131%) when administered at 10 mg/kg on days 20, 27 and 34. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that troxacitabine has a potent in vivo antitumor activity associated with tumor regressions and complete cures in animals with tumors refractory to current chemotherapeutic agents.","['Gourdeau, Henriette', 'Genne, Philippe', 'Kadhim, Salam', 'Bibeau, Lucie', 'Duchamp, Olivier', 'Ouellet, France', 'deMuys, Jean-Marc', 'Bouffard, David Y', 'Attardo, Giorgio']","['Gourdeau H', 'Genne P', 'Kadhim S', 'Bibeau L', 'Duchamp O', 'Ouellet F', 'deMuys JM', 'Bouffard DY', 'Attardo G']","['Shire BioChem Inc., 275 Armand-Frappier Blvd, Laval, Quebec H7V 4A7, Canada. hgourdeau@ca.shire.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Dioxolanes/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/11/27 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2001/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0530-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Dec;50(6):490-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0530-7.

METHODS: CEM/0, seven ara-C- and/or ASNase-resistant clones, Jurkat/0, the myelomonocytic line U937 and U87 MG glioblastoma cell lines were used for these studies. The drug-resistant leukemic clones lack p53, express bcl-2 and VEGF-R1, and thus are refractory to apoptosis. Since tyrosine kinases drive many proliferative pathways and these activities are increased in many leukemic cells, we hypothesized that NSC 680410 may induce cytotoxicity in drug-resistant leukemia clones, independently of p210bcr/abl expression. RESULTS: NSC 680410 exhibited significant antileukemic activity in CEM/0, Jurkat E6-1, and in the drug-resistant leukemic cell lines. The IC(50) values in nine leukemia lines ranged from 17 to 216 n M. Western blot analyses after NSC 680410 treatment demonstrated caspase-3 cleavage and ELISAs showed a fivefold upregulation of its activity in cellular extracts. In addition, U87 MG human glioblastoma cells, which express VEGF-R1, were treated with the Flt-1/Fc chimera, a specific inhibitor of VEGF, and showed 30-43% cell kill in the MTT assay. Furthermore, the combination of NSC 680410 plus Flt-1/Fc chimera demonstrated an eightfold synergism against U87 MG cells in vitro. To verify this observation in vivo, athymic mice were inoculated orthotopically into the caudate putamen with 10(6) U87 MG cells. On day 3, five mice per group were treated i.p. with either 8.3 mg/kg NSC 680410 daily for three doses per week for 4 weeks alone or in combination with one dose of Flt-1/Fc chimera 100 mg/kg subcutaneously. Treatment with NSC 680410 alone produced no weight changes and increased the median survival to 133%, whereas treatment with NSC680410 plus Flt-1/Fc chimera increased survival to 142% over control. Control animals had large intra- and extracranial tumors while the NSC 680410-treated mice had small, only intracranial tumors with necrotic centers. The combination treatment resulted in small residual tumors around the needle track, indicating significant inhibition of tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor NSC 680410 has significant antileukemic activity in p53-null, drug-resistant human leukemia cell lines, as well as significant antitumor activity in combination with Flt-1/Fc chimera against U87 MG glioblastoma brain tumors implanted in situ in athymic mice.","['Avramis, Ioannis A', 'Christodoulopoulos, Garyfallia', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Laug, Walter E', 'Gonzalez-Gomez, Ignacio', 'McNamara, George', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Avramis, Vassilios I']","['Avramis IA', 'Christodoulopoulos G', 'Suzuki A', 'Laug WE', 'Gonzalez-Gomez I', 'McNamara G', 'Sausville EA', 'Avramis VI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USC Keck School of Medicine, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/11/27 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0507-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Dec;50(6):479-89. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0507-6.

This involves daily intravenous (i.v.) administration for 4-8 weeks, with its attendant drawbacks: inconvenience, risks and expense of maintaining suitable vascular access and hospitalization. We therefore developed an oral formulation, administered it to patients and set out to assess the resulting systemic bioavailability of arsenic. METHODS: With ethics committee approval, nine patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia were recruited after giving informed consent. On day 1, each received 10 mg As2O3 by i.v. infusion over 1 h. Each patient swallowed 10 mg As2O3 in 10 ml oral solution 24 h later (day 2) and on subsequent days thereafter. Prior to and until 48 h post-i.v. dosing, timed venous blood samples were drawn and corresponding plasma and whole blood arsenic concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Systemic bioavailability was inferred from the area under the arsenic level versus time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule. Day-1 AUC after i.v. dosing was taken to be 100% and that attributed to oral dosing (day 2) was then calculated. The 48-h arsenic levels in blood cells were calculated using hematocrit values and corresponding plasma and whole blood arsenic concentrations. RESULTS: Respective day-2 mean plasma and blood AUCs attributed to oral dosing were 99% and 87% of corresponding day-1 values. On average, 48-h blood cell arsenic levels were 270% greater than in plasma ( P=0.013). No patient suffered unexpected complications, and five went into remission. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with i.v. dosing, our oral As2O3 formulation was more convenient and cost effective, and the ensuing systemic bioavailability of arsenic appeared similar. Arsenic seemed to be concentrated in the cellular fraction of blood 48 h after starting As2O3 treatment.","['Kumana, C R', 'Au, W Y', 'Lee, N S L', 'Kou, Maybelle', 'Mak, R W M', 'Lam, C W', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Kumana CR', 'Au WY', 'Lee NS', 'Kou M', 'Mak RW', 'Lam CW', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Professorial Block, Room 406, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China. hrmekcr@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2002/11/27 04:00,2003/04/05 05:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00228-002-0514-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;58(8):521-6. doi: 10.1007/s00228-002-0514-x.

Interestingly, the leukemic stem cell (LSC) shares many characteristics with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) including the ability to self-renew and a predominantly G(0) cell-cycle status. Thus, although conventional chemotherapy regimens often ablate actively cycling leukemic blast cells, the primitive LSC population is likely to be drug-resistant. Moreover, given the quiescent nature of LSCs, current drugs may not effectively distinguish between malignant stem cells and normal HSCs. Nonetheless, based on recent studies of LSC molecular biology, we hypothesized that certain unique properties of leukemic cells could be exploited to induce apoptosis in the LSC population while sparing normal stem cells. In this report we describe a strategy using treatment of primary AML cells with the proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG-132) and the anthracycline idarubicin. Comparison of normal and leukemic specimens using in vitro culture and in vivo xenotransplantation assays shows that the combination of these two agents induces rapid and extensive apoptosis of the LSC population while leaving normal HSCs viable. Molecular genetic studies using a dominant-negative allele of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (IkappaBalpha) demonstrate that inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) contributes to apoptosis induction. In addition, gene-expression analyses suggest that activation of p53-regulated genes are also involved in LSC apoptosis.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to determine the plasma concentrations of retinol and alpha-tocopherol in patients undergoing dose-intensive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant and to examine the association of plasma concentrations with clinical outcomes reflecting immunity. DESIGN: This was an observational trial of 120 consecutive recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and a multivariate analysis of plasma vitamin concentrations, mucositis, infections in the first 30 d, and herpes zoster infections in the first year after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. RESULTS: Plasma retinol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations declined from baseline to day 7, typically recovering without specific replacement toward baseline by day 14. The severity of mucositis was a strong predictor of low plasma retinol on day 7 (P = 0.001). Eighty-two patients (68%) had at least one plasma retinol concentration < or = 1.05 micro mol/L, a concentration previously determined to be of immunologic significance, during the peritransplant period (day -8 to day 14). Men more frequently acquired herpes zoster than women, and men who developed hyporetinolemia (< or = 1.05 micro mol/L) had a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster (OR: 6.6; 95% CI: 1.5, 29.6). Plasma alpha-tocopherol was not associated with any clinical event measured in this study. CONCLUSION: Hyporetinolemia is common, particularly in subjects with severe mucositis, and is associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster infection in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additional investigations are required to determine whether these findings indicate a causal relation.","['High, Kevin P', 'Legault, Claudine', 'Sinclair, Jane A', 'Cruz, Julia', 'Hill, Kevin', 'Hurd, David D']","['High KP', 'Legault C', 'Sinclair JA', 'Cruz J', 'Hill K', 'Hurd DD']","['Sections of Infectious Diseases and of Hematology and Oncology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1042, USA. khigh@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Breast Neoplasms/surgery', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/blood', 'Humans', 'Infections/*blood', 'Inflammation/*blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mucous Membrane', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tocopherols/blood', 'Vitamin A/*blood', 'alpha-Tocopherol/*blood']",2002/11/27 04:00,2002/12/21 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcn/76.6.1358 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2002 Dec;76(6):1358-66. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/76.6.1358.,,,"['11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",,,['M01 RR07122/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the kidney eliminates approximately 60% of fludarabine's primary metabolite (F-ara-A), dose modification is necessary for all patients with impaired renal function including elderly patients. In this study, 22 patients with varying levels of renal function received a single intravenous dose of fludarabine (25 mg/m3), followed one week later by five (one per day) doses that were adjusted according to three predefined creatinine clearance (CLcr) levels. Relationships between renal function and F-ara-A clearance, F-ara-A exposure and F-ara-A--related toxicities were examined. The results demonstrate that total F-ara-A clearance correlated with CLcr and that F-ara-A exposure levels and patient toxicity profiles were similar across treatment groups. IN CONCLUSION: The CLcr-based fludarabine dose adjustments used in this study provided reasonably equivalent F-ara-A exposure with acceptable safety in patients with varying degrees of renal function.","['Lichtman, Stuart M', 'Etcubanas, Erlinda', 'Budman, Daniel R', 'Eisenberg, Peter', 'Zervos, George', ""D'Amico, Paul"", ""O'Mara, Vivian"", 'Musgrave, Kimberly', 'Cascella, Peter', 'Melikian, Armen', 'Hinderling, Peter H', 'Ferrer, Jorge M', 'Williams, Gary J']","['Lichtman SM', 'Etcubanas E', 'Budman DR', 'Eisenberg P', 'Zervos G', ""D'Amico P"", ""O'Mara V"", 'Musgrave K', 'Cascella P', 'Melikian A', 'Hinderling PH', 'Ferrer JM', 'Williams GJ']","['Don Monti Division of Medical Oncology, North Shore University Hospital-NYU School of Medicine, 300 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. slichtma@suffolk.lib.ny.us']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Creatinine/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2002/11/27 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/cnv-120005903 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2002;20(7-8):904-13. doi: 10.1081/cnv-120005903.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including ventilatory capacity, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were performed before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after BMT, and every 12 months thereafter. Possible pre- and post-BMT risk factors were evaluated for their influence on pulmonary function. Patients were divided into two groups according to their survival duration for more than 12 months or not. Pretransplant PFTs were essentially normal except for mild reduction in DLCO values in the short-term survival group. Overall pulmonary function changes revealed persistent and significant decrease of forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO values after BMT. The DLCO values reached abnormal levels (< 80%) and showed a trend of incomplete recovery. Decrease of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and vital capacity were also noted but the FEV1/FVC ratio remained within normal limits after BMT. Transient fall of total lung capacity after BMT was noted. However, its values did not reach abnormal levels such as to cause restrictive ventilatory impairment. Possible risk factors including gender, smoking, bronchiolitis obliterans, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were found to have significant influences on posttransplant pulmonary function changes by multiple regression analysis. Most patients except those who developed bronchiolitis obliterans were clinically asymptomatic. Development of bronchiolitis obliterans was the most important factor to cause both clinical symptoms and impaired pulmonary function. In summary, pulmonary function changes before and after HLA-matched allogeneic BMT in long-term survivors of CML only showed modest dysfunction. The primary negative presentation with the development of oxygenation defect had no clinical significance in most patients. The influences on the impairment of pulmonary function were multifactorial.","['Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Tung, Shiao-Lin', 'Wang, Wei-Shu', 'Tzeng, Woan-Fang', 'Yen, Chueh-Chuan', 'Fan, Frank S', 'Liu, Jin-Hwang', 'Chen, Po-Min']","['Chiou TJ', 'Tung SL', 'Wang WS', 'Tzeng WF', 'Yen CC', 'Fan FS', 'Liu JH', 'Chen PM']","['Section of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital and National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, No. 201, Sec 2, Shih-Pai Road, Taipei 112, Taiwan, ROC. tjchiou@vghtpe.gov.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Lung/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/11/27 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/cnv-120005900 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2002;20(7-8):880-8. doi: 10.1081/cnv-120005900.,,,['0 (HLA-A Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not this is associated with altered surfactant components or functions. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 24 children with malignancies, immunosuppression, pulmonary infiltrates and fever unresponsive to empirical antibiotic treatment were compared to that from 24 healthy children. Levels of surfactant protein (SP) A and D and their binding capacity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as levels of SP-B and SP-C, were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The large and small surfactant aggregate forms were separated and the biophysical activity of large surfactant aggregates was determined using a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Compared to healthy controls, SP-A levels were increased four-fold, the increase being most pronounced in those children with pathogens recovered from their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In children with malignancies, levels of SP-C were increased two-fold and of small surfactant aggregates five-fold. No differences were observed in levels of SP-B or SP-D, binding capacity of SP-A or SP-D or the surface activity of large surfactant aggregates. The increased levels of surfactant protein A, particularly in children with recovered microorganisms, and unchanged binding capacity of surfactant protein A are consistent with upregulated local host defence mechanisms. Increased surfactant protein A and C may also be responsible for the conserved biophysical activity of surfactant in children with malignancies, immunosuppression, pulmonary infiltrates and fever.","['Griese, M', 'Neumann, M', 'von Bredow, T', 'Schmidt, R', 'Ratjen, F']","['Griese M', 'Neumann M', 'von Bredow T', 'Schmidt R', 'Ratjen F']","[""Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. griese@pk-i.med.uni-muenchen.de""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/immunology/metabolism', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fever/*complications', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/immunology/metabolism', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphoma/complications/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/immunology/metabolism', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Radiography', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/diagnostic imaging/immunology/metabolism']",2002/11/27 04:00,2003/02/22 04:00,['2002/11/27 04:00'],"['2002/11/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1183/09031936.02.00205702 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2002 Nov;20(5):1284-91. doi: 10.1183/09031936.02.00205702.,,,['0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARF can be isolated or became as component of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS comprises a number of metabolic abnormalities (hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, azotemia and hypocalcemia) which are associated with lymphoproliferative malignancies following spontaneous or chemotherapy-induced cytolysis. There exist probably no clear prediction for the development of TLS that could enable early detection of manifestation of this severe condition. SUBJECTIVE: Conventional management with aggressive hydration, alkalization of the urine, administration of allopurinol, and the slow introduction of chemotherapy is often unable to prevent metabolic instability and ARF. Recent studies define a subgroup of patients at higher risk of renal failure during induction chemotherapy. ARF was encountered during initial therapy of patients with a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) index greater than 3.3. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A retrospective analysis of 10 children (3 girls, 7 boys, average age 9.7 years) with LDII index greater than 3.3 has been done. All children were treated for lymphoproliferative malignancy with conventional preventive measures. RESULTS: Three children needed haemodialysis--2 boys had fully expressed TLS with ARF shortly after starting chemotherapy, in 1 boy the dialysis was indicated because of extreme hyperuricemia and high creatinine level presented before chemotherapy. We consider that LDH index is not specific criterium for prediction of TLS. In conclusion, our cases demonstrate the pathophysiologic spectrum of ARF in TLS between hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia. CONCLUSION: The LDH index, urine output, and hyperphosphatemia could be used to identify those paediatric patients who would benefit from the prospective use some of extracorporeal elimination methods. Further investigation of this techniques in a larger number of patients is warranted.

CD24, which is expressed only on granulocytes and not on monocytes, has not been adequately studied. Surface marker studies on eight control marrows indicate that CD24 is expressed on bone marrow granulocytes in a pattern that is similar to CD11b while much different than the more mature markers, CD16b and CD35. Three sorting experiments show that the majority of CD24(-) cells are promyelocytes. We conclude that CD24 is expressed on the neutrophilic granulocytes at the stage of myelocytes, and hence it could potentially be used to study normal and abnormal maturation of granulocytes.","['Elghetany, M Tarek', 'Patel, Jyoti']","['Elghetany MT', 'Patel J']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-0743, USA. melghetautmb.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10176 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Dec;71(4):348-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10176.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 30 patients with available data at diagnosis, 18 (60%) had extra-chromosomal abnormalities. They included 1q duplication (5/18, 28%), supernumerary Ph chromosome (4/18, 22%), 9p abnormalities (3/18, 17%), 7q deletion/monosomy 7 (3/18, 17%), trisomy 19 (1/18, 6%), and trisomy 8 (1/18, 6%). Excluding those with specific cytogenetic changes, only one patient had hyperdiploid karyotype with more than 50 chromosomes. The incidence of 1q duplication was higher and that of hyperdiploidy was lower in this study than has been previously reported. There was no prognostic implication of these additional cytogenetic abnormalities. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 14 (27%) of 53 unselected adult ALL patients and 2 (5%) of 38 unselected pediatric patients were BCR-ABL-positive, including one adult and two children without Ph chromosome. The BCR-ABL fusion genes/transcripts were also present in all other 16 selected Ph-positive ALL patients. The BCR-ABL fusion subtypes were determined in all these 32 patients: 91% (11/12) childhood cases showed m-type fusion gene while 45% (9/20) adult ones did so (P = 0.0083).

In the present study, sAFP levels were measured in order to determine its sensitivity and specificity in 33 Turkish FA patients (17 males and 16 females) with a mean age of 11.6 +/- 7.7 (1.0-28.0) (median 10.0). Complementation groups were available in 12 patients. Nineteen age-matched healthy children, 17 patients with bone marrow failure syndromes, 37 FA heterozygotes, and 37 children with acute leukemia served as negative control groups. The sAFP was measured by particle immunoassay. The level of sAFP was found to be higher than the cut-off value, 8 IU/mL in 46% and was within normal limits in 54% of the FA patients. The AFP values were within normal limits in all of the subjects belonging to the control groups. This method provided 46% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the diagnosis of FA. The sAFP values were high in 4 of 17 (24%) FA patients who did not receive any androgen therapy, while the sAFP level was high in 7 of 9 (78%) patients who received such a therapy. The statistical analysis of incidence of a high sAFP level between these two groups indicated a significant difference (P = 0.014), suggesting that androgen therapy might be a contributing factor for elevation of sAFP. The comparison of several clinical and laboratory parameters between FA patients with high and normal levels of AFP revealed no statistically significant differences. The level of sAFP was elevated in only 5 of the 11 patients with complementation group A; in addition, variable levels of sAFP were noted among the affected members in 4 families, indicating that complementation groups, type of mutation, or familial factors were not responsible for elevation of sAFP.","['Aslan, Deniz', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Alikasifoglu, Mehmet', 'Altay, Cigdem']","['Aslan D', 'Gumruk F', 'Alikasifoglu M', 'Altay C']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Turkey', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/*analysis']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10231 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Dec;71(4):275-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10231.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The K-HOT study group decided to examine whether this proposal was applicable to clinical practice in a multicenter study. Patients who developed fever with neutrophil counts <1,000/microL were randomized to receive either a single antibiotic, cefepime or one of the carbapenems, or a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside. Patients who became afebrile within the first 3 days were continued on the same treatment. Patients who remained febrile were switched to a combination regimen if they were randomized to receive a single agent, and patients on combination medication were changed from cefepime to another cephalosporin. A total of 165 patients were entered into the trial. One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response. The average age was 52 years, and 70% of the patients had acute leukemia. Severe neutropenia, defined as <100/microL at the time of FN, was seen in 62% of the patients on entry and during the course of treatment 71% of patients experienced neutrophil counts of <100/microL. Microbiologically documented infection was seen in 6.5% for monotherapy, and 10.5% for a combination treatment, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 75.3% and 59.2% of the patients in each regimen, respectively. Excellent to good response was seen in two-thirds of the patients in all treatment groups. Adverse events were minimal, and three early deaths were observed at days 9, 16, and 16 among patients treated with a single antibiotic and three in the combination regimen group at days 14, 15, and 20.

Efficacy of epirubicin (an analog of doxorubicin), however, has not been adequately evaluated in ALL management. This randomized study was undertaken to compare the relative efficacy of epirubicin vs. doxorubicin as part of induction chemotherapy in adult ALL. Between January 1990 and June 1998, 79 previously untreated adult ALL patients (age 11-55 years, median 20 years) were randomized to receive either doxorubicin (Group A, n = 39) or epirubicin (Group B, n = 40) as a part of induction therapy. Vincristine and prednisolone were common in each group. The induction treatment was followed by identical consolidation and maintenance therapy. The two groups were compared as regards pretherapy clinical and laboratory parameters, dose intensity of therapy, therapeutic efficacy, myelotoxicity, and survival. Epirubicin was as effective as doxorubicin in terms of complete remission rate (80% vs. 78.3%; P = 0.87) and relapse rate (57.1% vs. 51.7%; P = 0.68). Five-year overall survival (30% vs. 30%, P = 0.98) and disease-free survival (40% vs. 39%, P = 0.92) at median follow-up of 68 months was also similar in the two groups. The incidence of Grade 4 myelotoxicity was comparable in the two groups. Patients 20 years of age or less had better CR rates (90% vs. 65%; P = 0.011) and median overall survival (39 vs. 11 months; P = 0.008) compared to those who were older. From this study epirubicin appears as effective as doxorubicin as part of induction therapy for adult ALL.

Data from several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and three large community-based studies in patients with hematologic malignancies indicate that recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, epoetin alfa) can correct anemia, reduce transfusion requirements, and improve QOL. Moreover, a positive relationship has been found between increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels and improvements in QOL assessments, regardless of disease state, with the greatest incremental improvement occurring when Hb increases from 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL (range, 11 to 13 g/dL). This suggests that patients with mild-to-moderate anemia may achieve the greatest QOL benefit from epoetin alfa therapy. Evidence from community-based studies suggests that epoetin alfa administered once weekly has a similar safety and efficacy profile as three-times-weekly administration. Further research is ongoing with less frequent dosing regimens. The beneficial effects of epoetin alfa therapy have been reported in studies involving patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas.

Analysis of patient karyotypes reveals that nonrandom, somatically acquired translocations and inversions occur in most acute myeloid leukemias. Among these, fusion oncogenes have been identified that utilize similar signal transduction pathways and transcriptional activation pathways to mediate their leukemogeneic effect. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), both in vitro and in vivo animal studies show that BCR-AB expression leads to clinical manifestations of CML, demonstrating that BCR-AB and its fusion proteins are central mediators of myeloid proliferation and transformation in these malignancies. In other CML syndromes (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical CML), cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints has identified a spectrum of constitutively activated tyrosine kinases. These tyrosine kinase fusions alone apparently are both necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the disease phenotype in the murine model. In contrast, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is typified by chromosomal translocations involving transcription factors needed for normal myeloid differentiation. The functional consequence of translocations is loss of function of these transcription factors, resulting in impaired myeloid differentiation. However, these alone are not sufficient to cause acute leukemia; evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that second mutations are required. Data suggest a multistep pathogenesis for AML in which class I mutations, such as activating point mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (eg, FLT3 and c-KIT), provide a proliferative and/or survival signal to hematopoietic progenitors. Class II mutations are those targeting hematopoietic transcription factors and serving primarily to impair differentiation and subsequent apoptosis. Together, these mutations result in leukemic cells capable of proliferation and survival but not differentiation. The clinical and therapeutic implication is that it may be possible to target both classes of mutations using selected or screened small-molecule inhibitors. Insights gained from molecular genetic analysis of AML provide the basis for a rational, targeted therapeutic approach.","['Gilliland, D Gary']",['Gilliland DG'],"[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics/*therapy', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2002.36921 [doi]', 'S003719630200080X [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2002 Oct;39(4 Suppl 3):6-11. doi: 10.1053/shem.2002.36921.,45,,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Advances in automated hematology instrumentation, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are significantly improving our ability to recognize and classify spontaneous myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of flow cytometry-based light scatter patterns provided by the Cell-Dyn 3500 (CD3500) automated hematology analyzer to predict the lineage of leukemic cells in peripheral blood of dogs and cats. METHODS: Leukemic cells from 15 dogs and 6 cats were provisionally classified using an algorithm based on the CD3500 CBC output data and were subsequently phenotyped by enzyme cytochemistry, immunocytochemistry, indirect flow cytometry, and analysis of antigen receptor gene rearrangement. RESULTS: The algorithm led to correct predictions regarding the ontogeny of the leukemic cells (erythroid/megakaryocytic potential, myeloid leukemia, monocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia, lymphoid leukemia) in 19/21 animals. Mismatches in the WBC impedance count and the WBC optical count in conjunction with microscopic assessment of blasts in the blood were useful for predicting myeloproliferative disorders with erythroid or megakaryocytic potential. The leukocyte light scatter patterns enabled distinction among myeloid leukemias (represented by acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia) and lymphocytic leukemias (including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias). One case of acute lymphocytic leukemia was misidentified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithmic analyses can be applied to data generated by the CD3500 to predict the ontogeny of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood of dogs and cats.

We analysed the short and long-term efficacy of a stably expressed dominant-negative mutant (DN) of the telomerase catalytic unit (hTERT) in UT-7 and U937 human leukemia cell lines by using an IRES-e-GFP retrovirus. As expected, telomerase inactivation resulted in drastic telomere shortening, cytogenetic instability and cell growth inhibition in all e-GFP positive DN clones after 15-35 days of culture. However, despite this initial response, 50% of e-GFP positive DN clones with short telomeres escaped from crisis after 35 days of culture and recovered a proliferation rate similar to the control cells. This rescue was associated with a telomerase reactivation inducing telomere lengthening. We identified two pathways, one involving the loss of the DN transgene expression and the other the transcriptional up-regulation of endogenous hTERT with persistence of the DN transgene expression. Although this second mechanism appears to be a very rare event (one clone), these findings suggest that genomic instability induced by short telomeres after telomerase inhibition might enhance the probability of activation or selection of telomere maintenance mechanisms dependent on hTERT transcription.","['Delhommeau, Francois', 'Thierry, Antoine', 'Feneux, Daniele', 'Lauret, Evelyne', 'Leclercq, Edwige', 'Courtier, Marie Helene', 'Sainteny, Francoise', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise']","['Delhommeau F', 'Thierry A', 'Feneux D', 'Lauret E', 'Leclercq E', 'Courtier MH', 'Sainteny F', 'Vainchenker W', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A']","['INSERM U362, PR-1, Institut Gustave Roussy, 39/53 rue Camille Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Telomerase/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Telomere', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/26 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2002/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1206054 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Nov 28;21(54):8262-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206054.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of the acute-phase response on the ligand binding ability of plasma was studied in leukemic children with and without systemic inflammation (sepsis and septic shock). To target different transport proteins, differentially charged fluorescent dyes were used: anionic ANS (8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate), uncharged Nile red, and cationic Quinaldine red. Human serum albumin was a principal carrier for ANS and competed for Nile red binding with lipoproteins. The synchro-scan fluorescence spectra of Nile red in plasma distinguished two species of the dye bound to serum albumin and to low-density and/or very low-density lipoproteins. The binding of Quinaldine red did not correlate with albumin and lipoprotein levels, and was probably determined by alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Compared with the control group, leukemia increased Quinaldine red binding by 65% and did not significantly affect the binding of other probes. Sepsis and septic shock did not change the binding of Quinaldine red, but progressively decreased ANS binding, finally by about 33%, and shifted Nile red distribution from serum albumin toward lipoproteins. These changes reflected a modified composition of the three principal transport proteins in plasma in the acute-phase response. Simple and rapid fluorescent tests developed in this study can be used to evaluate the acute-phase response and to optimize drug administration protocols in clinical practice.","['Ivanov, A I', 'Gavrilov, V B', 'Furmanchuk, D A', 'Aleinikova, O V', 'Konev, S V', 'Kaler, G V']","['Ivanov AI', 'Gavrilov VB', 'Furmanchuk DA', 'Aleinikova OV', 'Konev SV', 'Kaler GV']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/*blood', 'Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/complications', 'Ligands', 'Lipoproteins/blood', 'Male', 'Oxazines', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'Quinaldines', 'Sepsis/blood/complications', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Shock, Septic/blood/complications', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s102380200021 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2002 Nov;2(3):147-55. doi: 10.1007/s102380200021.,,,"['0 (Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Quinaldines)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '630I4V6051 (1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate)', 'P476F1L81G (nile red)', 'Z70656T34N (quinaldine red)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of the medical records of the 102 neutropenic CICPs admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) over a 10-year period. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Malignancies consisted of acute leukemia (n=42), lymphoma (n=23), myeloma (n=28), and solid tumors (n=9). Reasons for ICU admission were acute respiratory failure (n=81), shock (n=58), acute renal failure (n=33), and coma (n=13). Seventy patients needed conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) and 21 noninvasive MV, 67 vasopressor agents, and 28 dialysis. Sixty-two patients experienced NR during their ICU stay. In a multivariate logistic regression model, 30-day mortality was higher in patients with acute respiratory or renal failure and lower in patients with NR (OR, 0.09 [0.01-0.86]). This model assumed that patients who experienced NR in the ICU were merely these who did not die early in the ICU. To take into account the effect of time to occurrence of NR on time to death we secondarily used a Cox model including neutropenia duration and NR as time-dependent variables. In this second model, the only significant predictors of 30-day mortality were age, respiratory failure, renal failure, and coma. CONCLUSION: Organ failure but not disease progression or neutropenia duration affect 30-day mortality in neutropenic CICPs. ICU-acquired events might be modeled as time-dependent variables in a Cox model, rather than standard covariates in logistic regression models.","['Darmon, Michael', 'Azoulay, Elie', 'Alberti, Corinne', 'Fieux, Fabienne', 'Moreau, Delphine', 'Le Gall, Jean-Roger', 'Schlemmer, Benoit']","['Darmon M', 'Azoulay E', 'Alberti C', 'Fieux F', 'Moreau D', 'Le Gall JR', 'Schlemmer B']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Saint Louis University Hospital and Paris 7 University, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Intensive Care Med,Intensive care medicine,7704851,IM,"['Adult', 'Critical Illness/*mortality', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms/complications/*mortality', 'Neutropenia/etiology/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2001/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00134-002-1528-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Intensive Care Med. 2002 Dec;28(12):1775-80. doi: 10.1007/s00134-002-1528-7.

We have previously shown that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induction of erythroid differentiation in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells correlates with delay of apoptosis and specific induction of Bcl-X(L). In this study, we investigate the contribution of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) to survival and erythroid differentiation by generating stable MEL transfectants expressing these antiapoptotic regulators. Overexpression of Bcl-2 completely prevented apoptosis of MEL cells before and after DMSO induction, whereas overexpression of Bcl-X(L) only delayed it. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) neither induced spontaneous erythroid differentiation nor accelerated DMSO-induced differentiation. Inhibition of Bcl-X(L) by antisense transcripts accelerated apoptosis in DMSO-treated MEL cells and blocked the synthesis of hemoglobin without altering the growth arrest associated with terminal erythroid differentiation. An antisense oligonucleotide to Bcl-X(L) did not induce apoptosis in MEL cells overexpressing Bcl-2 but greatly decreased their hemoglobin synthesis when treated with DMSO, suggesting that Bcl-X(L) is necessary for erythroid differentiation independently of its antiapoptotic function. Importantly, Bcl-X(L) antisense transcripts prevented heme synthesis but not globin mRNA induction in DMSO-treated MEL cells. Furthermore, inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis by Bcl-X(L) antisense was reversed by addition of exogenous hemin. Finally, Bcl-X(L) localized to mitochondria during MEL erythroid differentiation, suggesting that it may mediate a critical mitochondrial transport function related to heme biosynthesis.","['Hafid-Medheb, Khalid', 'Augery-Bourget, Yvette', 'Minatchy, Marie-Nathalie', 'Hanania, Nicole', 'Robert-Lezenes, Jacqueline']","['Hafid-Medheb K', 'Augery-Bourget Y', 'Minatchy MN', 'Hanania N', 'Robert-Lezenes J']","['INSERM U268-Hopital Paul-Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0478 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51143-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2575-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0478.

Binding of these cytokines to their cognate receptor leads to activation of the Jak-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and altered gene expression. This signal pathway has been intensely studied using human IFN-alpha 2 and IFN-beta. However, there are over 14 human IFN-alpha subtypes and over 10 murine IFN-alpha subtypes, with a single IFN-beta subtype in both species. J2E cells are immortalized at the proerythroblast stage of development and produce a rapid and fatal erythroleukemia in vivo. These cells retain the ability to respond to erythropoietin in vitro by proliferating, differentiating, and remaining viable in the absence of serum. Here, we show that J2E cells are also functionally regulated differentially by IFN subtype treatment in vitro. A novel finding was the selective activation of STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) molecules by different subtypes binding the IFN receptor. These findings indicate distinct effects for individual type I IFN subtypes, which are able to differentially activate members of the STAT and MAPK family. Finally, we investigated the efficacy of IFN naked DNA therapy in treating J2E-induced erythroleukemia in athymic nude mice. IFN subtypes differentially regulated the onset of erythroleukemia with delayed onset and increased survival, possibly via a reduction in cell viability, and enhanced antiproliferative and apoptotic effects observed for IFNA6 and IFNA9 treatment, respectively. Moreover, these data highlight the necessity to choose the best IFN subtype in disease treatment.","['Cull, Vanessa S', 'Tilbrook, Peta A', 'Bartlett, Emmalene J', 'Brekalo, Natalie L', 'James, Cassandra M']","['Cull VS', 'Tilbrook PA', 'Bartlett EJ', 'Brekalo NL', 'James CM']","['Division of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Western Australian Biomedical Research Institute, Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Isoforms/pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1521 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51163-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2727-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1521.

The predicted amino acid sequence of the CD20 suggests 4 transmembrane-spanning regions with both N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate herein that significant levels of circulating CD20 (cCD20) can be detected in the plasma of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and that cCD20 interferes with the binding of rituximab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to CLL cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure circulating cCD20 levels in the plasma. We measured cCD20 levels in the plasma of 180 patients with CLL and correlated these levels with clinical characteristics and outcome. Circulating CD20 levels correlated positively with beta(2)-microglobulin level (p =.006) and percentage of CD38(+) cells (p =.03) and negatively with platelet count (p =.004) and hemoglobin level (p =.02). Patients with advanced Rai (III/IV) or Binet (C) stage disease had significantly higher levels of cCD20 than did patients with earlier-stage disease (P =.01 and P =.006, respectively). There was no correlation between cCD20 level and age, lymphocyte count, or white blood cell count. Using a recursive classification method, we found that patients with a cCD20 level more than 1875 nM/L had significantly shorter survival than those with cCD20 1875 nM/L or below (P =.01). The prognostic value of cCD20 was independent of Rai staging or hemoglobin level. Prospective evaluation is indicated to establish whether rituximab dosing should be adjusted according to cCD20 levels.","['Manshouri, Taghi', 'Do, Kim-anh', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Giles, Francis J', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Saffer, Helen', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Jilani, Iman', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Manshouri T', 'Do KA', 'Wang X', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Saffer H', 'Thomas D', 'Jilani I', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

ELL is an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that interacts with the recently identified EAF1 protein. To characterize the normal functions of ELL and its aberrant activities when fused to MLL, we isolated a second protein that interacts with ELL named EAF2 for ELL Associated Factor 2. EAF2 is highly homologous to EAF1, with 58% identity and 74% amino acid conservation. Using specific antibodies generated to EAF2, we coimmunoprecipitated ELL and EAF2 from multiple cell lines. Confocal microscopy revealed that endogenous EAF2 and ELL colocalized in a nuclear speckled pattern. Database comparisons with EAF2 identified a region with a high content of serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues that is conserved with EAF1 and exhibited amino acid similarity with several translocation partner proteins of MLL, including AF4 and ENL. We found that EAF2 and EAF1 both contain transcriptional activation domains within this region. Using retroviral bone marrow transduction, we observed that a heterologous fusion of EAF2 to MLL immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast to EAF1, EAF2 does not bind to the carboxy-terminus of ELL. We identified a protein-protein interaction domain within the amino-terminus of ELL that binds to both EAF1 and EAF2. This amino-terminal interaction domain is disrupted in the formation of the MLL-ELL fusion protein. Thus, MLL-ELL retains an interaction domain for EAF1 but not for EAF2. Taken together, these data suggest that MLL-ELL may disrupt the normal protein-protein interactions of ELL.","['Simone, Federico', 'Luo, Roger T', 'Polak, Paul E', 'Kaberlein, Joseph J', 'Thirman, Michael J']","['Simone F', 'Luo RT', 'Polak PE', 'Kaberlein JJ', 'Thirman MJ']","['University of Chicago, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Glutamic Acid/analysis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology', 'Serine/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Transfection']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1664 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57356-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2355-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1664.

However, its potential as a treatment for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) has not been evaluated. EB1089 induced apoptosis in all of the 102 B-CLL samples tested with a mean LD(50) (the concentration of EB1089 required to kill 50% of cells) value (+/- SD) of 2.1 x 10(-8) M (+/- 1.4 x 10(-8) M). Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the cytotoxicity of EB1089 in B-CLL samples from previously treated and untreated patients (P =.1637). Induction of apoptosis was associated with a reduction in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein expression, but this was evident only in the apoptotic cells. In contrast, the expression of Bax, p21, and p53 was not altered in the viable or apoptotic cells from either B- or T-lymphocyte lineages. EB1089-induced apoptosis was preceded by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, and this was associated with downstream activation of caspase-3. The pancaspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and the caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) were able to partially abrogate the apoptotic effects of EB1089 but did not affect the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase or the suppression of ERK. The B-CLL cells in the study were shown to highly express vitamin D receptor, but an additional receptor-independent mechanism of cell killing cannot be ruled out at this stage. These findings show that EB1089 is a potent apoptosis-inducing agent in B-CLL cells and may be useful in the treatment of B-CLL patients, particularly those with p53 mutations or drug-resistant disease.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Bentley, Paul', 'Fegan, Chris']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Milligan D', 'Bentley P', 'Fegan C']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, United Kingdom. chrisp@llanhaem.demon.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-1984 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51123-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2454-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-1984.

Many think that B-cell progenitors (BCPs) are confined to bone marrow (BM) niches until they differentiate into B cells and that they do not circulate in blood. The prevailing convention is that BCP transit a CD34(+)CD19(-)10(+) early-B-->CD34(+)CD19(+)CD10(+) B-cell progenitor (pro-B)-->CD34(-)CD19(+)CD10(+) B-cell precursor (pre-B) differentiation pathway within BM. However, populations of CD34(+)CD10(+) and CD34(+)CD19(+) cells circulate in adult peripheral blood and neonatal umbilical cord blood (CB) that are operationally taken as BCPs on the basis of their phenotypes, although they have not been submitted to a systematic characterization of their gene expression profiles. Here, conventional CD34(+)CD19(+)CD10(+) and novel CD34(+)CD19(+)CD10(-) BCP populations are characterized in CB by single-cell sorting and multiplex analyses of gene expression patterns. Circulating BCP are Pax-5(+) cells that span the early-B, pro-B, and pre-B developmental stages, defined by the profiles of rearranged V-D-J(H), CD79, VpreB, recombination activating gene (RAG), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression. Contrary to the expectation, circulating CD34(+)CD19(-)CD10(+) cells are essentially devoid of Pax-5(+) BCP. Interestingly, the novel CD34(+)CD19(+)CD10(-) BCP appears to be the normal counterpart of circulating preleukemic BCPs that undergo chromosomal translocations in utero months or years before their promotion into infant acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia after secondary postnatal mutations. The results underscore the power of single-cell analyses to characterize the gene expression profiles in a minor population of rare cells, which has broad implications in biomedicine.","['Sanz, Eva', 'Alvarez-Mon, Melchor', 'Martinez-A, Carlos', 'de la Hera, Antonio']","['Sanz E', 'Alvarez-Mon M', 'Martinez-A C', 'de la Hera A']","['Laboratory of Immunology and Oncology, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Alcala University Research Associated Unit, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/analysis']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2244 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50719-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3424-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2244.

Correlation of phenotype and T-cell receptor (TCR) status with RAG-1 and pT alpha transcription in 114 T-ALLs demonstrated that they largely reflect physiologic T-lymphoid development. Half the TCR alpha beta lineage T-ALLs expressed a pre-TCR, as evidenced by RAG-1, pT alpha, and cTCR beta expression, absence of TCR delta deletion, and a sCD3(-), CD1a(+), CD4/8 double-positive (DP) phenotype, in keeping with a population undergoing beta selection. Most TCR gamma delta T-ALLs were pT alpha, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and RAG-1(lo/neg), double-negative/single-positive (DN/SP), and demonstrated only TCR beta DJ rearrangement, whereas 40% were pT alpha, TdT, and RAG-1 positive, DP, and demonstrated TCR beta V(D)J rearrangement, with cTCR beta expression in proportion. As such they may correspond to TCR alpha beta lineage precursors selected by TCR gamma delta expression, to early gamma delta cells recently derived from a pT alpha(+) common alpha beta/gamma delta precursor, or to a lineage-deregulated alpha beta/gamma delta intermediate. Approximately 30% of T-ALLs were sCD3/cTCR beta(-) and corresponded to nonrestricted thymic precursors because they expressed non-T-restricted markers such as CD34, CD13, CD33, and CD56 and were predominantly DN, CD1a, pT alpha, and RAG-1 low/negative, despite immature TCR delta and TCR gamma rearrangements. TCR gene configuration identified progressive T-lymphoid restriction. T-ALLs, therefore, provide homogeneous expansions of minor human lymphoid precursor populations that can aid in the understanding of healthy human T-cell development.","['Asnafi, Vahid', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Boulanger, Emmanuelle', 'Comba, Beatrice', 'Le Tutour, Patricia', 'Estienne, Marie-Helene', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Quartier, Pierre', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Valensi, Francoise', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Asnafi V', 'Beldjord K', 'Boulanger E', 'Comba B', 'Le Tutour P', 'Estienne MH', 'Davi F', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Quartier P', 'Buzyn A', 'Delabesse E', 'Valensi F', 'Macintyre E']","['Department of Biological and Clinical Hematology, Centre Hospitalier-Universitaire/Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (CHU/AP-HP) Necker-Enfants Malades and Universite Paris V, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*classification', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2438 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51159-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2693-703. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2438.

Cotreatment with SAHA and imatinib (Gleevec) caused more down-regulation of the levels and auto-tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and apoptosis of these cell types, as compared with treatment with either agent alone (P <.05). This finding was also associated with a greater decline in the levels of phospho-AKT and Bcl-x(L). Significantly, treatment with SAHA also down-regulated Bcr-Abl levels and induced apoptosis of CD34(+) leukemia blast progenitor cells derived from patients who had developed progressive blast crisis (BC) of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) while receiving therapy with imatinib. Taken together, these findings indicate that cotreatment with SAHA enhances the cytotoxic effects of imatinib and may have activity against imatinib-refractory CML-BC.","['Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi', 'Fuino, Lianne', 'Stobaugh, Corinne', 'Richon, Victoria', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Nimmanapalli R', 'Fuino L', 'Stobaugh C', 'Richon V', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Computer Systems', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vorinostat']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2675 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50826-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3236-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2675.

This approach shifts tumor eradication to the graft-vs-host immune response directed against minor histocompatibility antigens expressed on tumor cells. This is not without risk, as the long-term effects of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), it's treatment, or resulting complications and immunodeficiency may be life threatening. However, this approach does allow the application of a potentially curative procedure to elderly or medically infirm patients who would not tolerate high-dose conditioning regimens. Section I, by Dr. Sandmaier, describes the current use of nonmyeloablative regimens and matched related or unrelated donors for the treatment of patients with CLL, CML, acute leukemia, MDS, lymphoma, and myeloma. In Section II, Dr. Maloney discusses the use of cytoreductive autologous followed by planned non-myeloablative allografts as treatment for patients with myeloma or NHL. This tandem transplant approach has a lower TRM than conventional high dose allografting. The nonmyeloablative allograft may allow the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) immune response to eradicate the minimal residual disease that causes nearly all patients with low-grade NHL or myeloma to relapse following autologous transplantation. In Section III, Dr. Mackinnon discusses the risks and benefits of T cell depletion strategies to prevent acute GVHD, while retaining GVT activity by planned donor lymphocyte infusions. Finally, in Section IV, Dr. Shizuru discusses the relationship between GVHD and GVT activity. Future studies, employing a greater understanding of these issues and the separation of GVHD from GVT activity by immunization or T cell cloning, may allow nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation to be safer and more effective.","['Maloney, David G', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Shizuru, Judith A']","['Maloney DG', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Mackinnon S', 'Shizuru JA']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The lymphoid morphology was studied on blood smear stained with May Gr nwald Giemsa and the immunophenotypical analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The 72 patients with B-CLL were characterized by a predominance of small mature lymphocytes with a Matutes's CLL score 3 (generally CD5+, CD23+, SmIg poor expression). 4 out of B-CLL with cleaved lymphocytes 5 % showed the same immunological characteristics than the typical B-CLL cases. 3 cases of B-CLL with prolymphocytes between 5 and 55 % showed in 2 cases an immunophenotyping compatible with the diagnosis of B-CLD. The presence of shadow cells of Gumprecht was highly evocative of B-CLL. In conclusion, the cytological analysis remains at the root of any diagnosis and can be sufficient in most cases of typical CLL with the presence of shadow cells of Gumprecht on the blood smear. In case of presence of cleaved lymphocytes, the immunophenotyping becomes essential to confirme the diagnosis of B-CLL. In prolymphocytic cases, the differential diagnosis between mixed CLL and B-CLD (especially Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma without villous lymphocytes) needs a multidisciplinary approach (clinical, cytogenetical and histological).","['Guillaume, N', 'Alimardani, G', 'Capiod, J C', 'Claisse, J F']","['Guillaume N', 'Alimardani G', 'Capiod JC', 'Claisse JF']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre hospitalier universitaire Sud, Avenue Rene La nnec, Salouel, 80054 Amiens cedex 1, France.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Blood Specimen Collection/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/immunology/pathology']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2002 Nov-Dec;60(6):673-81.,,Pertinence des analyses cytologiques et immunophenotypiques dans le diagnostic de la leucemie lymphoide chronique B.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, FCM is able to detect clonality in B or T proliferations and criteria for malignancies such as abnormal phenotype. Finally it also specifies prognosis criterias. Among the different haematological malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) can be diagnosed using FCM, whereas acute myeloblastic leukaemia diagnosis is only confirmed by this methodology, which could moreover determine prognosis factors. A scoring system (EGIL) determine the normal counterpart of tumoral cells using a panel of different markers. Immunophenotyping is also useful in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) by using a similar scoring system (so-called Matutes scoring). Since FCM is able to detect simultaneously numerous cell markers it could be more accurate than immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or hairy cell leukaemia.

The antitumor effect of salvicine is associated with its ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis. Telomerase plays an important role in the apoptotic pathway. However, little is known about the mechanisms of telomerase regulation during apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs. This study investigated the regulation of telomerase activity in salvicine-induced human leukemia HL-60 cell apoptosis. Salvicine treatment resulted in HL-60 cell apoptosis and down-regulation of telomerase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Repression of telomerase activity preceded a decrease in expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) and telomerase-associated protein (TP1) at the mRNA level, suggesting that the salvicine-induced decrease in telomerase activity may be additionally regulated by mechanisms other than telomerase subunit transcription. We observed that okadaic acid (OA), a protein phosphatase inhibitor, prevented the induction of apoptosis and the down-regulation of telomerase activity by salvicine. The significant increase in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity induced by salvicine treatment was blocked completely by OA. Moreover, although salvicine induced HL-60 cell apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner, a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, did not prevent a decrease in telomerase activity or an increase in PP2A activity in apoptotic HL-60 cells, ruling out a role for caspase-3 in PP2A activation by salvicine. The results collectively suggest that the salvicine-induced decline in telomerase activity is not a consequence of HL-60 cell apoptosis and that it may be caused principally by the dephosphorylation of telomerase components mediated by PP2A activation.","['Liu, Wei-Jun', 'Jiang, Jian-Fei', 'Xiao, Dong', 'Ding, Jian']","['Liu WJ', 'Jiang JF', 'Xiao D', 'Ding J']","['Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/01/17 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202014247 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01424-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Dec 15;64(12):1677-87. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01424-7.,,,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (salvicine)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the members of Ikaros family produce multiple isoforms via alternative mRNA splicing. Altered expression of Ikaros isoforms has been found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia but it is not studied whether the altered expression of Aiolos isoforms also has a role in the development of leukemias or lymphomas. We developed a quantitative real-time PCR application to detect the relative expression of Aiolos splice variants. The method is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-labelled isoform specific hybridisation probes used with the LightCycler instrument. The isoform specificity is obtained by targeting the probes at the edges of chosen exons.

Because of the complexity and the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression profiles, the dimensional reduction of raw expression data and the feature selections necessary for, for example, classification of disease samples remains a challenge. To solve the problem we propose a two-level analysis. First self-organizing map (SOM) is used. SOM is a vector quantization method that simplifies and reduces the dimensionality of original measurements and visualizes individual tumor sample in a SOM component plane. Next, hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering is used to identify patterns of gene expression useful for classification of samples. RESULTS: We tested the two-level analysis on public data from diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The analysis easily distinguished major gene expression patterns without the need for supervision: a germinal center-related, a proliferation, an inflammatory and a plasma cell differentiation-related gene expression pattern. The first three patterns matched the patterns described in the original publication using supervised clustering analysis, whereas the fourth one was novel. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that by using SOM as an intermediate step to analyze genome-wide gene expression data, the gene expression patterns can more easily be revealed. The ""expression display"" by the SOM component plane summarises the complicated data in a way that allows the clinician to evaluate the classification options rather than giving a fixed diagnosis.","['Wang, Junbai', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Aasheim, Hans', 'Smeland, Erlend', 'Myklebost, Ola']","['Wang J', 'Delabie J', 'Aasheim H', 'Smeland E', 'Myklebost O']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, N0310 Oslo, Norway. junbaiw@radium.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*classification/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Software']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2105-3-36 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2002 Nov 24;3:36. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-3-36.

This usually requires either a panel of HLA-typed cells or HLA cDNA transfectants. Although preparation of HLA cDNA transfectants is laborious, utilization of transfectants is advantageous when a suitable panel is not available due to linkage disequilibrium or rarity of the HLA allele of interest. In this report, we describe an efficient and rapid HLA cloning and expression system. Three sets of PCR primers specific for HLA-A, B and C loci were designed by extensively sequencing 5'- and 3'- untranslated regions of HLA class I genes. The PCR-amplified products were introduced into modified Phoenix retrovirus vectors containing a puromycin resistant gene under the control of a LTR promotor. Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped retrovirus was produced and infected into B-lymphoid cell lines. Following expansion in selection media, more than 80% of cells expressed transduced HLA at a comparable level to that normally expressed. These results indicate that locus-specific PCR cloning and utilization of GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vector can be an effective and relatively efficient tool for constructing a panel of different HLA transfectants.","['Akatsuka, Y', 'Goldberg, T A', 'Kondo, E', 'Martin, E G', 'Obata, Y', 'Morishima, Y', 'Takahashi, T', 'Hansen, J A']","['Akatsuka Y', 'Goldberg TA', 'Kondo E', 'Martin EG', 'Obata Y', 'Morishima Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Hansen JA']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/04/05 05:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['tan590607 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1399-0039.2002.590607.x [doi]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2002 Jun;59(6):502-11. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-0039.2002.590607.x.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,"['AI 33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 49213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, Mcl-1 was shown to be significantly increased in interleukin-6-overexpressed basal cell carcinoma cells and conferred on them anti-apoptotic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate which signaling pathway is involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of interleukin-6 on basal cell carcinoma cells. Here we show that the addition of recombinant 100 ng per ml interleukin-6 to basal cell carcinoma cells induced a 2.3-fold increase in the level of Mcl-1 protein in basal cell carcinoma cells. Transfection with dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3F) into inter-leukin-6-treated basal cell carcinoma cells caused a decrease of phosphotyrosyl STAT3 but did not alter Mcl-1 protein levels; however, AG490, a Janus tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was capable of inhibiting the interleukin-6-induced elevation of Mcl-1 protein. Next, interleukin-6 stimulation elicited extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in basal cell carcinoma cells, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD98059, could affect this response without affecting the interleukin-6-medi-ated Mcl-1 upregulation. Use of the two phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, to check whether this pathway is involved in Mcl-1 upregulation by interleukin-6, we found that the phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitors completely attenuated the interleukin-6-induced Mcl-1 upregulation. Furthermore, in the interleukin-6-overexpressing basal cell carcinoma cell clone, dominant-negative Akt also significantly reduced the increased level of Mcl-1. Interestingly, Janus tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG490, treatment strongly blocked the phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase pathway activation, as evidenced by the decrease in phospho-Akt level. Blockage of phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway abolished the interleukin-6-mediated anti-apoptotic activity in ultraviolet B treated cells. Unexpectedly, without ultraviolet B irradiation, STAT3F transfection also induced a significant apoptosis in basal cell carcinoma/interleukin-6 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that both the phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt and STAT3 pathways are potentially involved in interleukin-6-mediated cell survival activity in basal cell carcinoma cells; however, the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein by interleukin-6 is mainly through the Janus tyrosine kinase/phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt, but not the STAT3 pathway.","['Jee, S H', 'Chiu, H C', 'Tsai, T F', 'Tsai, W L', 'Liao, Y H', 'Chu, C Y', 'Kuo, M L']","['Jee SH', 'Chiu HC', 'Tsai TF', 'Tsai WL', 'Liao YH', 'Chu CY', 'Kuo ML']","['Department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', '*Carcinoma, Basal Cell', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/radiation effects', '*Skin Neoplasms', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2002/11/26 04:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/11/26 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)30074-9 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19503.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2002 Nov;119(5):1121-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19503.x.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cecum, ileus, and ascending colon are most commonly involved. Initial symptoms are usually nonspecific abdominal pain and fever. Localized, severe right lower quadrant pain, sepsis, and bowel perforation may rapidly develop. Once considered a fatal complication, the outcome for the child with NE has improved with better diagnostic imaging techniques and antibiotics.

M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells arrest growth and differentiate into macrophages following treatment with interleukin 6 (IL-6) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and recent studies have shown that Stat3 plays a central role in this process. Utilizing representational difference analysis, we demonstrate that expression of the mouse BATF gene is upregulated as an early response to IL-6/LIF stimulation and Stat3 activation in this cell system. Immunoblots using antibodies to BATF detected an increase in BATF protein in response to LIF/IL-6 stimulation. BATF is a member of the AP-1 family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors and functions to inhibit the transcriptional and biological functions of AP-1 activity in mammalian cells. BATF forms complexes with c-Jun in M1 cells and forced expression of BATF in the absence of Stat3 signaling results in a reduced rate of cellular growth. These results indicate that Stat3 mediates cellular growth by modulating AP-1 activity through the induction of BATF.","['Senga, Takeshi', 'Iwamoto, Takashi', 'Humphrey, Sean E', 'Yokota, Takashi', 'Taparowsky, Elizabeth J', 'Hamaguchi, Michinari']","['Senga T', 'Iwamoto T', 'Humphrey SE', 'Yokota T', 'Taparowsky EJ', 'Hamaguchi M']","['Department of Molecular Pathogenesis, Nagoya University School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai Showa Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2002/11/22 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/11/22 04:00'],"['2002/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205918 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Nov 21;21(53):8186-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205918.,,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Batf protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,['CA78264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl constitutively activates several signaling proteins important for the proliferation and survival of myeloid progenitors, including the Src family kinases Hck and Lyn, the Stat5 transcription factor and upstream components of the Ras/Erk pathway. Recently, we found that kinase-defective Hck blocks Bcr-Abl-induced transformation of DAGM myeloid leukemia cells to cytokine independence, suggesting that activation of the Src kinase family may be essential to oncogenic signaling by Bcr-Abl. To investigate the contribution of Src kinases to Bcr-Abl signaling in vivo, we used the pyrrolo-pyrimidine Src kinase inhibitors PP2 and A-419259. Treatment of the Ph+ CML cell lines K-562 and Meg-01 with either compound resulted in growth arrest and induction of apoptosis, while the Ph- leukemia cell lines TF-1 and HEL were unaffected over the same concentration ranges. Suppression of Ph+ cell growth by PP2 and A-419259 correlated with a decrease in Src kinase autophosphorylation. Both inhibitors blocked Stat5 and Erk activation, consistent with the suppressive effects of the compounds on survival and proliferation. In contrast, the phosphotyrosine content of Bcr-Abl and its endogenous substrate CrkL was unchanged at inhibitor concentrations that induced apoptosis, blocked oncogenic signaling and inhibited Src kinases. These data implicate the Src kinase family in Stat5 and Erk activation downstream of Bcr-Abl, and identify myeloid-specific Src kinases as potential drug targets in CML.","['Wilson, Matthew B', 'Schreiner, Steven J', 'Choi, Hyun-Jung', 'Kamens, Joanne', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Wilson MB', 'Schreiner SJ', 'Choi HJ', 'Kamens J', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2002/11/22 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/11/22 04:00'],"['2002/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1206008 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Nov 21;21(53):8075-88. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206008.,,,"['0 (A 419259)', '0 (AG 1879)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,['CA 81398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells originate from pluripotent hemopoietic progenitors. In contrast to basophils and other leukocytes, MCs exhibit a remarkably long life span (years) in vivo. Although a role for stem cell factor (SCF) and SCF receptor (KIT) in long-term survival of MCs has been proposed, the underlying biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have examined expression of 'survival-related' molecules of the bcl-2 family including bcl-2 and bcl-x(L), in primary human MCs and the human MC line HMC-1. Primary MCs were isolated from dispersed lung tissue by cell sorting using an antibody against KIT. mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blotting. RESULTS: As assessed by RT-PCR, purified unstimulated lung MCs (>98% pure) exhibited KIT- and bcl-x(L) mRNA, but did not express bcl-2 mRNA. However, exposure of lung MCS to SCF (100 ng/ml) for 8 h resulted in expression of bcl-2 mRNA. Corresponding results were obtained by immunocytochemistry. In fact, exposure of MC to SCF resulted in expression of the bcl-2 protein whereas unstimulated MCs displayed only the bcl-x(L) protein without expressing the bcl-2 protein. The human MC leukemia cell line HMC-1, which contains a mutated and intrinsically activated SCF receptor, showed constitutive expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-x(L) at the mRNA and protein level. CONCLUSION: Our data show that human MCs can express members of the bcl-2 family. It is hypothesized that bcl-x(L) plays a role in KIT-independent growth of MCs, whereas bcl-2 may be involved in KIT-dependent functions of MCs.","['Baghestanian, Mehrdad', 'Jordan, John-Hendrik', 'Kiener, Hans P', 'Bevec, Dorian', 'Agis, Hermine', 'Fritsch, Gerhard', 'Muller, Michael R', 'Bankl, Hans C', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Valent, Peter']","['Baghestanian M', 'Jordan JH', 'Kiener HP', 'Bevec D', 'Agis H', 'Fritsch G', 'Muller MR', 'Bankl HC', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Angiology, University of Vienna, Austria.

This study compared the gene profile of nephritic NZB/W kidney with nondiseased NZW controls. The most highly upregulated gene (5.5-fold) hybridized with an expressed sequence tag on a cDNA microarray, which was sequenced and found to correspond with an endogenous murine retrovirus related to the Duplan strain (EDV, L08395). NZB/W kidney contained the full-length 4.2-kb EDV transcript. By 4 wk of age in NZB/W mice, an age preceding renal histologic disease, the EDV transcript was more than threefold increased relative to NZB or NZW control strains. This upregulated expression tended to fall with progression of renal histologic disease. By in situ hybridization, the EDV transcript was highly expressed in tubules of NZB/W mice. There was also upregulated expression of EDV transcript in NZB/W lung and brain, sites of inflammation in this strain, but not in spleen or liver. Thus, using microarrays, the most highly expressed gene in mouse lupus nephritis corresponded to an endogenous retrovirus. This retroviral transcript was highly expressed in the kidneys of lupus mice and tended to decline with advancement of disease. The remarkable upregulation of the EDV transcript only in the setting of active disease suggests this transcript is involved in inflammatory disease.","['Alexander, Jessy J', 'Saxena, Amit K', 'Bao, Lihua', 'Jacob, Alexander', 'Haas, Mark', 'Quigg, Richard J']","['Alexander JJ', 'Saxena AK', 'Bao L', 'Jacob A', 'Haas M', 'Quigg RJ']","['Section of Nephrology, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

These leukemic cells can give rise in vivo to clonally related IgG(+) or IgA(+) elements. The requirements and modalities of this process remain elusive. Here we show that leukemic B cells from 14 of 20 CLLs contain the hallmarks of ongoing Ig class switch DNA recombination (CSR), including extrachromosomal switch circular DNAs and circle transcripts generated by direct S micro -->Sgamma, S micro -->Salpha, and S micro -->Sepsilon as well as sequential Sgamma-->Salpha and Sgamma-->Sepsilon CSR. Similar CLL B cells express transcripts for activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a critical component of the CSR machinery, and contain germline I(H)-C(H) and mature V(H)DJ(H)-C(H) transcripts encoded by multiple Cgamma, Calpha, and Cepsilon genes. Ongoing CSR occurs in only a fraction of the CLL clone, as only small proportions of CD5(+)CD19(+) cells express surface IgG or IgA and lack IgM and IgD. In vivo class-switching CLL B cells down-regulate switch circles and circle transcripts in vitro unless exposed to exogenous CD40 ligand and IL-4. In addition, CLL B cells that do not class switch in vivo activate the CSR machinery and secrete IgG, IgA, or IgE upon in vitro exposure to CD40 ligand and IL-4. These findings indicate that in CLL at least some members of the malignant clone actively differentiate in vivo along a pathway that induces CSR. They also suggest that this process is elicited by external stimuli, including CD40 ligand and IL-4, provided by bystander immune cells.","['Cerutti, Andrea', 'Zan, Hong', 'Kim, Edmund C', 'Shah, Shefali', 'Schattner, Elaine J', 'Schaffer, Andras', 'Casali, Paolo']","['Cerutti A', 'Zan H', 'Kim EC', 'Shah S', 'Schattner EJ', 'Schaffer A', 'Casali P']","['Division of Molecular Immunology, Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA. acerutti@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'DNA, Circular/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Immunoglobulin Switch Region', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Recombination, Genetic']",2002/11/22 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/11/22 04:00'],"['2002/11/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.11.6594 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Dec 1;169(11):6594-603. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.11.6594.,,,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,"['AR40908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR47872/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR040908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AG13910/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07621/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR047872/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007621/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI045011/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI45011/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI045011/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4625981,,,['NIHMS481402'],,,,,,,,

However, many published series of CLL included a subgroup of CD5(-) cases. CD5(-) B cell CLL is a topic of controversy and its nature and true incidence remain unclear. We in this study performed a retrospective analysis of a total of 128 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of CLL and available immunophenotypic record. Of these, 14 cases were previously considered CD5(-) CLL. From a further analysis of clinical, hematological and immunophenotypic results, we have reclassified seven of the patients as having weak or dim expression of CD5 and four patients as being monoclonal B lymphocytosis of undetermined significance (MLUS). The remaining three cases had clinical and morphological features consistent with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or mixed CLL/PLL. Our results suggest that the CD5(-) phenotype probably does not qualify for CLL. Previous CD5(-) CLL may include false negatives due to heterogeneity of the intensity of CD5 expression, CD5(-) MLUS and variant CLL; the latter likely represents CLL in transformation. All the patients with MLUS were found to have a mild and non-progressing lymphocytosis with CD5(-) phenotype.

The bcl-xl, similar to bcl-2, inhibits apoptosis, whereas bcl-xs counters the effects of bcl-2 and bcl-xl. Mononuclear cells of bone marrow cells were obtained from 50 patients with recurrent AML at diagnosis prior to treatment and during relapse. We investigated the expression of the two isoforms of the bcl-x gene, bcl-xl and bcl-xs. The bcl-xl transcript was detected in all patients at both stages, but the bcl-xs transcript was not detected in six cases at both stages and in seven other cases at relapse (bcl-xs (-) group, n=13). The duration of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the bcl-xs (-) group were significantly shorter than those of the bcl-xs (+) group (RFS: P=0.04; OS: P=0.02). Subsequently, mutation of the bcl-x gene was investigated. No mutation of the bcl-x gene was detected in all patients of both stages. Some refractory leukemic cells which escape chemotherapy-induced apoptosis due to loss of the bcl-xs transcript may continue to proliferate, resulting in the relapse of chemotherapy-resistant leukemia. The examination of the expression status of the bcl-x gene could facilitate the prediction of chemotherapy resistance and the prognosis of patients with refractory AML. The future large study will confirm the present data about loss of bcl-xs gene expression as prognostic factor.","['Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Dan, Kazuo']","['Yamaguchi H', 'Inokuchi K', 'Dan K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/11/22 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/22 04:00'],"['2002/11/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000619 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00061-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Dec;26(12):1119-23. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00061-9.,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate a potential role of Smad4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression of Smad4 was determined in blast cells from AML patients. Western analysis of nuclear extracts of nine AML samples indicated the absence of Smad4 protein in two cases. Smad4 RT-PCR analysis of these cases indicated normal Smad4 mRNA expression, and sequencing of one of these cases revealed no mutations as compared to wild type Smad4. Next, it was investigated whether Smad4 protein from these AML cases was subject to proteolytic degradation by incubating cell extracts of these Smad4-negative AML cells with extracts from COS-7 cells in which a tagged Smad4 was overexpressed. Inhibitor studies indicated that the extracts of AML blasts lacking Smad4 possessed a serine-dependent proteolytic activity, capable of degrading Smad4. Transfection studies using an SBE containing reporter construct as well as RT-PCR analysis of endogenous TGFbeta1 responsive genes indicated that the AML blasts were still able to respond to TGFbeta1, despite the observed degradation of Smad4. It was, therefore, concluded that the degradation of Smad4 was possibly AML subtype-dependent, in vitro phenomenon, occurring during the preparation of nuclear and cellular extracts despite the addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail. The results indicate that care should be taken when interpreting data obtained from protein expression studies using AML blast cells.","['Wierenga, Albertus T J', 'Eggen, Bart J L', 'Kruijer, Wiebe', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Wierenga AT', 'Eggen BJ', 'Kruijer W', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Extracts', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smad4 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/pharmacology']",2002/11/22 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/22 04:00'],"['2002/11/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000541 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00054-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Dec;26(12):1105-11. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00054-1.,,,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro data demonstrates that DAB(389)IL-2 is cytotoxic to cells expressing the high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). In Phases I and II clinical trials of patients whose tumor cells express a component of the IL-2R, the response rates were 18% for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 30% for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). In this study, we examined the effects of arginine butyrate on IL-2R expression and susceptibility of leukemia cells to intoxication by DAB(389)IL-2. We demonstrate that the p75 subunit of the IL-2R (IL-2Rbeta) is upregulated in the presence of low concentrations of arginine butyrate (0.06mM) which had no direct growth inhibitory effect on the cells. To explore mechanisms of this upregulation, we examined the effect of 0.06mM arginine butyrate on relevant transcriptional elements and on histone deacetylase and found activation of cAMP response element (CRE) but not NFAT or NFKB, as well as inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC).

This leukemia is mostly erythroblastic and 30% of leukemias have total and partial trisomy of #2 chromosome and the rest have diploid karyotype. The common duplication site is in 2q26-q34 and N-ras gene is located in 2q34. 7,8,12-Trimethylbenz[a]anthracene (TMBA) also induces similar leukemias. These leukemias reveal a highly specific mutation of N-ras gene as in human leukemias. N-ras mutation is induced 48h after DMBA treatment. Wild type N-ras allele is frequently lost in diploid leukemias but not in trisomy type. Therefore, a gene dosage problem related to the mutant N-ras gene is involved in development of leukemia. Some secondary genetic rearrangements involving abl and H-ras are also observed in cultured leukemia cells. DMBA-induced chromosome aberrations as well as leukemia are enhanced by erythropoietin and blocked by Sudan III given prior to DMBA treatment.

We designed a new NF-kappaB inhibitor that is based on the structe of the antibiotic epoxyquinomicin C. The designed compound, dehydroxymethyl-epoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB, and showed an anti-arthritic effect in mice. Recently, we looked into its mechanism of inhibition. DHMEQ inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced cellular DNA binding of nuclear NF-kappaB, but not the phosphorylation or degradation of I-kappaB. Moreover, DHMEQ inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced nuclear accumulation of p65, a component of NF-kappaB. On the other hand, DHMEQ did not inhibit the nuclear transport of Smad2 and the large T antigen. Also, it did not inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced activation of JNK, but synergistically induced apoptosis with TNF-alpha in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. Therefore, DHMEQ specifically inhibited the NF-kappaB-activating pathway in the TNF-alpha-treated cells. Taken together, our data show that DHMEQ is a unique inhibitor of NF-kappaB that acts at the level of the nuclear translocation.

Although MFs enhance tumorigenesis, they are neither mutagenic nor tumorigenic. The mechanism of their tumorigenic effect has not been elucidated. METHODS: To investigate the effect of MFs on apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we exposed the cells to static MFs of 6 mT generated by a magnetic disk of known intensity. Apoptosis was triggered by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT). Activation of caspases in situ using the fluorochrome-labeled inhibitor (FLICA) method and determination of plasma membrane integrity by excluding propidium iodide (PI) were measured by both laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and flow cytometry (FC). LSC and FC identified cells at three sequential stages of their demise: early apoptosis (cells with activated caspases and PI negative); late apoptosis (cells with activated caspases but unable to exclude PI); secondary necrosis (cells with apoptotic morphology no longer stained with FLICA, not excluding PI). RESULTS: MF alone did not induce any apoptogenic or necrogenic effect. CPT exposure led to the sequential appearance of apoptotic cells. In the presence of CPT and MF, the overall proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was not significantly changed. However, we consistently observed a significant increase in the frequency of late apoptotic/necrotic cells when compared with samples treated with CPT alone (P < 0.001), as well as a decrease in the percentage of early apoptotic cells (P = 0.013). The data obtained by FC and LSC were consistent with each other, showing a similar phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Whereas MF alone or with CPT did not affect overall cell viability, it accelerated the rate of cell transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis after induction of apoptosis by the DNA-damaging agent, CPT. Modulation of the kinetics of the transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis by MF in vivo may play a role in inflammation and tumorigenesis.","['Teodori, Laura', 'Grabarek, Jerzy', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Ghibelli, Lina', 'Bergamaschi, Antonio', 'De Nicola, Milena', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Teodori L', 'Grabarek J', 'Smolewski P', 'Ghibelli L', 'Bergamaschi A', 'De Nicola M', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Department of Biomedicine and Toxicology, UTS BIOTEC, ENEA-Casaccia, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Membrane/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry', 'Leukemia', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Necrosis']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.10160 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 2002 Nov 1;49(3):113-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.10160.,,,['XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)'],"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined analysis of telomere length and cell phenotype, however, remains difficult because few fluorochromes with suitable emission spectra tolerate the harsh conditions needed for DNA denaturation during hybridization of the telomere-specific PNA probe. We overcame these problems and developed a method for measuring telomere length in cell subsets characterized by the expression of two surface antigens. METHODS: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 were used for cell surface staining. Antigen-antibody complexes were covalently cross-linked onto the cell membrane before Flow-FISH. Cells were hybridized with a PNA probe conjugated to cyanine 5 (Cy5). Hoechst 33342 (HO342) was added for determination of cellular DNA content. For assay standardization, we added an aliquot of a single batch of 1,301 cells to each sample as an internal control before hybridization with the PNA probe. Samples were prepared in duplicate and analyzed on a standard three-laser BD LSR flow cytometer. For assay validation, the same samples were analyzed in parallel to correlate the percentage of telomere length of the sample versus 1,301 control cells to the mean size of terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) of DNA as determined by Southern gel analysis. RESULTS: The method permitted clear identification of lymphocyte subsets in samples hybridized for Flow-FISH, with subset frequencies comparable to those of untreated samples. At a concentration of 10 nM, the Cy5-labeled telomere-specific PNA probe produced a bright fluorescence signal well separated from background. Addition of HO342 in low concentration did not interfere with Cy5 telomere fluorescence, produced adequate DNA histograms, and permitted clear identification of cell phenotype. The probe concentration of 10 nM also proved optimal for inclusion of 1,301 control cells for assay standardization. Telomere length estimations by the current method correlated highly with TRF calculations by Southern gel hybridization (r(2)= 0.9, P = 0.0003). Application of our protocol to the analysis of human CD8CD28 lymphocyte subsets showed that CD8(+bright)CD28(-) lymphocytes generally exhibit shorter telomeres than CD8(+bright)CD28(+) cells. These data concurred with previous results of telomere shortening in CD8(+)CD28(-) T cells that were obtained by using different techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The multiparameter Flow-FISH protocol permitted rapid determination of differences in telomere length in subpopulations characterized by two surface markers without prior cell separation.","['Schmid, Ingrid', 'Dagarag, Mirabelle D', 'Hausner, Mary Ann', 'Matud, Jose L', 'Just, Tom', 'Effros, Rita B', 'Jamieson, Beth D']","['Schmid I', 'Dagarag MD', 'Hausner MA', 'Matud JL', 'Just T', 'Effros RB', 'Jamieson BD']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California. schmid@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/chemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Staining and Labeling', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism/*pathology', 'Telomere/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.10163 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 2002 Nov 1;49(3):96-105. doi: 10.1002/cyto.10163.,,,"['0 (Alexa 488 hydrazide)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydrazines)']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['AG05920/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-47665/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Causes include certain oral medication, perineal trauma, thrombo-embolic process or primary priapism. We report a case of priapism secondary to diffuse general atopic dermatitis. CASE REPORT: An 11 year-old child, with atopic dermatitis, presented over the last 36 hours an irreduced painful penile erection. Other than priapism, he presented numerous scratched lesions on the body and the penis having developped over the last 2 months (treated by daily topical corticosteroid application) and consistent with atopic dermatitis exacerbation. Due to the urological emergency, a puncture of the corpora cavernosa was made, followed by an injection of etilephrine in the penis. Complete and definitive detumescence was obtained. Application of betamethasone healed the cutaneous lesions. The child was treated with ciclosporine for his atopic dermatitis with good results at 6 months. DISCUSSION: In our case, hypothesis of myeloid leukemia, sickle-cell disease and essential thrombocythemia were turned down. The young child did not exhibit any recent perineal trauma but the scratched lesions can be considered as microtraumas. The formation of an inflammatory oedema obstructed venous drainage of the penis and provoked priapism. We can not rule out the responsibility of topical corticosteroids in the formation of the priapism in this patient. Indeed, it was the only drug therapy prescribed, and since introduction of ciclosporine, there has been no relapse.","['Maitre, S', 'Michel, J L', 'Varlet, F', 'Cambazard, F']","['Maitre S', 'Michel JL', 'Varlet F', 'Cambazard F']","['Service de Dermatologie, CHU Saint-Etienne, France.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,IM,"['Anesthesia, General', 'Child', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*complications/drug therapy', 'Etilefrine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Injections', 'Male', 'Priapism/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Punctures', 'Time Factors', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2002/11/21 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AD-08-2002-129-8-9-0151-9638-101019-ART10 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2002 Aug-Sep;129(8-9):1038-41.,,Priapisme au cours d'une dermatite atopique generalisee.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', 'ZB6F8MY53V (Etilefrine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally identified from moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced T-cell lymphomas in mice, Pim-1 kinase is involved in the control of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Expression of Pim-1 kinase can be stimulated by a variety of growth factors and regulated at four different levels: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational. Several signal transduction pathways may be associated with the regulation of Pim-1's expression; accumulating data support that the expression of Pim-1 protein is mediated through activation of JAK/STATs.

However, very little data is available in literature on its potential genotoxicity on healthy human cells. Our objective is to study the potential in vitro genotoxicity of paclitaxel, by using the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay in combination with fluorescent in situ hybridization of nonspecific centromeric probes on human T-lymphocytes. Paclitaxel was found to significantly increase the micronucleated lymphocyte rates with a concentration-dependant manner. This increase is observed as early as with the weakest concentration tested (2,5 nM). Over 85% of those micronuclei contained one or more whole chromosomes, indicating that paclitaxel is a strong aneugenic drug. Paclitaxel induces the formation of aneuploid daughter cells, as a consequence of abnormalities in the distribution of chromosomes during the cell division. However, aneuploidy is probably one of the first events in the oncogenesis process, and it often seems to be linked to a dysfunction of the centrosome. An interaction between paclitaxel and centrosome could explain a considerable amount of the centromere-positive micronuclei due to multipolar mitosis. Paclitaxel, whose influence is being questioned in clinical practice in the occurrence of secondary acute myeloid leukemia, is therefore an in vitro aneugenic drug, which could be carcinogenic.","['Digue, Laurence', 'Orsiere, Thierry', 'Baciuchka-Palmaro, Marjorie', 'Duffaud, Florence', 'Pompili, Jocelyne', 'Favre, Roger', 'Botta, Alain']","['Digue L', 'Orsiere T', 'Baciuchka-Palmaro M', 'Duffaud F', 'Pompili J', 'Favre R', 'Botta A']","['Laboratoire de biogenotoxicologie (EA 1784, IFR PMSE 112), Faculte de Medecine, Universite de la Mediterranee, 27, bd Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille Cedex 5, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Centrosome/drug effects', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Micronucleus Tests', 'Paclitaxel/*adverse effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2002 Oct;89(10):887-92.,,Interet de l'etude de la genotoxicite in vitro d'une molecule de chimiotherapie sur cellules humaines : exemple du paclitaxel.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implementation of active surveillance (surveys) is an effective method to gain this information. For economical reasons, the sample size should be as small as possible but large enough to achieve the required confidence level for a targeted threshold. When conducting surveys repeatedly, various information sources about the disease status of the population can be taken into account to adjust the required level of confidence for a follow-up survey (e.g. risk assessments regarding disease introduction and results of previous surveys). As a benefit, the sample size for national surveys can be reduced considerably. We illustrate this risk-based approach using examples of national surveys conducted in Switzerland. The sample size for the documentation of freedom from enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL) and Brucella melitensis in sheep and in goats could be reduced from 2325 to 415 cattle herds, from 2325 to 838 sheep herds and from 1975 to 761 goat herds, respectively.","['Hadorn, Daniela C', 'Rufenacht, Jurg', 'Hauser, Ruth', 'Stark, Katharina D C']","['Hadorn DC', 'Rufenacht J', 'Hauser R', 'Stark KD']","['Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003 Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,IM,"['Animals', 'Brucella melitensis', 'Brucellosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Goat Diseases/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Goats', 'Health Surveys', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0167587702001939 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-5877(02)00193-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2002 Dec 30;56(3):179-92. doi: 10.1016/s0167-5877(02)00193-9.,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heterodimeric IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) consists of the p76 IL-7Ralpha subunit and the p64 common gamma (gammac) subunit. Ligand-binding induces signal transduction through tyrosine phosphorylation of the janus (Jak) and src-related kinases as well as by activation of phosphatidinositol-3 kinase (P13-kinase). In an effort to further define the requirements for ligand-receptor interactions and to subsequently develop candidate receptor binding antagonists with selective biological activities, we examined a series of IL-7 mutants in which the carboxy terminal hydrophobic residues were substituted with aliphatic amino acids. In this study we describe abrogation of IL-7 driven proliferation and attenuated phosphotyrosine signaling by IL-7(143) (Trp-Ala) and IL-7(143) (Trp-His) in IL-7R expressing T and B leukemia cells. Decreased phosphorylation of Jak3 kinase by IL-7W143A, IL-7W143P and IL-7W143H suggest that alterations in this region of the carboxyterminal region of IL-7 affects its interaction with the gammac subunit of the IL-7R.","['Gorgun, Gullu', 'van der Spek, Johanna', 'Cosenza, Larry', 'Menevse, Adnan', 'Foss, Francine']","['Gorgun G', 'van der Spek J', 'Cosenza L', 'Menevse A', 'Foss F']","['Hematology, Oncology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts New England Medical Center, 750 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/chemistry/*physiology', 'Precipitin Tests']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1043466602919745 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.2002.1974 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2002 Oct 7;20(1):17-22. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2002.1974.,,,['0 (Interleukin-7)'],,,['CA 48626/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty percent of infected mice, treated with four cycles of alternate administration of Fludarabine and AZT+DDI, showed undetectable levels of proviral DNA in lymph nodes. After 8 weeks of treatment interruption, the infected/treated animals, although still alive at a time when all untreated animals had succumbed to the infection, showed disease progression and reappearance of proviral DNA in lymph nodes. The retrospective analysis of proviral DNA content in spleen and bone marrow at the end of the fourth cycle of treatment revealed a low but detectable amount of BM5d proviral DNA. We thus concluded that the spleen and bone marrow may be less sensitive to lympholitic drugs and therefore act as viral reservoirs in LP-BM5 infection. This study suggests that optimized protocols of alternate administration of cytolytic and antiretroviral drugs may represent a useful strategy to eradicate retroviral infections.","['Fraternale, Alessandra', 'Casabianca, Anna', 'Orlandi, Chiara', 'Chiarantini, Laura', 'Brandi, Giorgio', 'Silvestri, Guido', 'Magnani, Mauro']","['Fraternale A', 'Casabianca A', 'Orlandi C', 'Chiarantini L', 'Brandi G', 'Silvestri G', 'Magnani M']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry Giorgio Fornaini, University of Urbino, 61029 Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Didanosine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/virology', 'Proviruses', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2002/11/21 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202916491 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1649 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Oct 25;302(2):354-62. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1649.,,,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'K3GDH6OH08 (Didanosine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, virions targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), after receptor binding, rapidly traffic to the lysosomes, where they are degraded. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to translocate from endosomes to the cytoplasm by means of a translocation domain (TLD). We generated a series of chimeric Env proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus containing EGFR ligands, where TLD was inserted into different regions. These chimeric proteins were successfully produced, if the translocation domain was not located at the immediate N-terminus of Env. The ability to transduce murine cells via the ecotropic receptor varied but correlated with the amount of Env proteins incorporated into the virions.

Resistomycin inhibited apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (AD) with or without acceleration by colcemid (CL) in human megakaryoblastic leukemia CMK-7 cells, IC50 for inhibition against AD-induced apoptosis was about 0.5 microM and IC50 for inhibition against AD plus CL-induced apoptosis was about 1 microM. CL alone induced weak apoptosis in cells, which was enhanced by resistomycin. Hypericin did not inhibit AD-induced apoptosis and slightly enhanced CL-induced apoptosis. Emodin, corresponding to 1 of 2 anthraquinone units in hypericin, did not show any effect on this apoptotic system. AD-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the antioxidative flavonoid, luteolin (IC50 45 microM), and a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, staurosporine (IC50 1.5 microM), but these compounds did not affect the CL-induced apoptosis. Hypericin and resistomycin scavenged superoxide anion radicals at the same rate as luteolin. PKC in CMK-7 cells was inhibited by hypericin and luteolin, but not significantly inhibited by resistomycin. This result suggests that the inhibition of AD-induced apoptosis by resistomycin is at least partly correlated with its antioxidative activity, and that the enhancement of CL-induced apoptosis by this compound depends upon the lack of PKC inhibitory activity. Though the mechanism is not clear, the enhancement of the CL-induced apoptosis might be hindered by PKC inhibition in the case of hypericin and luteolin.","['Shiono, Yoshihito', 'Shiono, Nobuyo', 'Seo, Shujiro', 'Oka, Syuichi', 'Yamazaki, Yoshimitsu']","['Shiono Y', 'Shiono N', 'Seo S', 'Oka S', 'Yamazaki Y']","['Research Institute of Biological Resources, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. y.shiono@aist.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

The specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL TK, STI571 was developed by Brian Druker and his co-workers in 1996. STI571 (Signal Transduction Inhibitor) occupies the kinase pocket of the BCR-ABL protein, and blocks ATP binding, thereby preventing phosphorylation of any substrate. Because of promising preclinical data STI571 entered clinical trials in 1998, using an oral formulation. The reports of this trials document excellent efficacy. Patients with chronic phase after failure with interferon therapy achieved more than 90% hematologic response, usually within 4-6 weeks, and 55% major cytogenetic response. Patients with advanced disease also responded, though less durably. In phase 2 studies the drug has continued to produce impressive results. STI571 has a very favourable pharmacologic feature, with high degree of specificity for its target, and therefore low toxicity for normal tissues, it is well tolerable, side effects were minimal.

This altered growth-factor sensitivity, which was a function of both the route of leukemia inoculation and drug administration, was detected by both the colony and the tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) incorporation assays. In contrast to transplant in normal mice, recurrent leukemia transplanted in mitoxantrone pretreated mice remained growth-factor insensitive. In addition, no growth delay of the recurrent leukemia occurred during this passage in pretreated mice. However, recovery of growth-factor sensitivity still occurred after a single subsequent transplant in normal mice. The magnitude of resistance developed by the recurrent leukemia was not increased by passage in mitoxantrone pretreated mice. Rather, the extent of resistance was a function of the dose of mitoxantrone employed in the treatment of the leukemia before recurrence. These data interpreted along with previously published observations suggest that the development of altered growth-factor sensitivity by SA7HD recurrent leukemia was directly linked to the presence of mitoxantrone. In addition, this phenomenon possibly confers survival advantage to the leukemia cells and this probably accounts for the observation that most of the drug-treated mice ultimately developed recurrent disease despite adequate treatment.","['Abubakar, Aminu A']",['Abubakar AA'],"['Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife KY16 9TS, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.01017.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2002 Nov-Dec;2(6):317-24. doi: 10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.01017.x.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usefulness of such assays for the prediction of clinical response to therapy has also been demonstrated. The existing methods used for this purpose are time consuming and labour intensive. Here we report a simplified flow cytometry based assay for evaluating the in vitro drug sensitivity of leukaemic cells. METHODS: The chemo-sensitivity of three human leukaemic cell lines (a lymphoblastoid cell line, Jurkat; an erythroleukaemic cell line, K 562 and a myelomonocytic cell line HL-60) was investigated by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was used to determine LD50 (50% inhibitory concentration) for prednisolone on Jurkat and daunorubicin on HL 60 and K 562 cell lines respectively. Per cent cell death could directly be assessed on a flow cytometer by measuring the fluorescence after staining with propidium iodide (PI). For comparison MTT assay was also performed using prednisolone on Jurkat and daunorubicin on HL-60. RESULTS: Cytotoxic effect of drugs was found to be dose dependent. Mean LD50 of prednisolone for Jurkat cells by flow cytometry was 0.805 +/- 0.058 mg/ml and by MTT assay 0.866 +/- 0.115 mg/ml. Mean LD50 of daunorubicin for HL-60 was 1.96 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml by flow cytometry and 1.90 +/- 0.282 micrograms/ml by MTT assay. The mean LD50 of daunorubicin to K 562 was 0.49 +/- 0.049 mg/ml by the flow cytometry method. The inter-assay variation for the LD50 by flow cytometry based assay was found to be 6, 14 and 10 per cent for Jurkat, HL-60 and K 562 respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: We report a flow cytometry based drug-sensitivity assay for leukaemic cells, which uses a single dye staining and is rapid, technically simple and reproducible. The results compare well with the more commonly used MTT assay, which is labour intensive and time consuming. The limitation of our method is that it can only be used for studying cells in suspension and is therefore not suitable for adherent cell lines.","['Gupta, Mamta', 'Naik, Sita', 'Pandey, C M', 'Dabadghao, Sunil']","['Gupta M', 'Naik S', 'Pandey CM', 'Dabadghao S']","['Department of Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/21 04:00,2003/02/08 04:00,['2002/11/21 04:00'],"['2002/11/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/21 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2002 Jun;115:260-4.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of follow-up time on relative risk estimates for leukemia and multiple myeloma in a cohort of 1,845 rubber hydrochloride workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for yearly follow-ups, beginning each study in 1940 and increasing study end dates from 1950 through 1996. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to explore the effects of follow-up time on the exposure-response relationship. RESULTS: The SMR for leukemia rose to 13.55 in 1961 and fell nearly monotonically to 2.47 by 1996. Cox modeling suggested interaction between cumulative exposure and time since exposure. A longer time to peak risk was seen for multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: Because summary risk estimates change with follow-up time, exposure limits set using these estimates may not adequately protect workers. Consideration of appropriate follow-up time and use of more complex temporal models are critical to the risk assessment process.","['Silver, S R', 'Rinsky, R A', 'Cooper, S P', 'Hornung, R W', 'Lai, D']","['Silver SR', 'Rinsky RA', 'Cooper SP', 'Hornung RW', 'Lai D']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 4676 Columbia Parkway, MS R-44, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

A new 2-styrylchromone has been synthesized by the Baker-Venkataraman method and a classical approach has been used to assess the effects of 2-styrylchromone (3'-allyl-4',5,7-trimethoxy-2-styrylchromone) on rat liver mitochondrial bioenergetic. Mitochondrial respiratory rate and transmembrane potential were measured polarographically using a Clark oxygen electrode and with a selective electrode, respectively. All the disturbance induced by 2-styrylchromone on the enzymatic activities (succinate dehydrogenase, succinate cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) and in the mitochondrial osmotic volume were determined spectrophotometrically. State 4, state 3, and uncoupled (presence of carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) respiration rates were decreased by 2-styrylchromone in a concentration-dependent manner. Depression of respiratory activity promoted by 2-styrylchromone is essentially mediated through partial inhibition of succinate cytochrome c reductase. Phosphorylation capacity was strongly depressed as a result of an inhibition on the enzymatic complex (F(0)F(1)-ATPase) and also because of a deleterious effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane, which uncoupled the respiration-generated proton gradient with the proton-driven phosphorylation. The structural integrity of the outside membrane is severely affected since cytochrome c can be released. 2-Styrylchromone uncouples oxidative phosphorylation by an inhibitory action on the redox chain and ATP synthase activity. Additionally, it can release cytochrome c. Cell death can probably result due to the induction of procaspase-9 and other procaspases and by a strong decrease of the available ATP.","['Peixoto, Francisco', 'Barros, Ana I R N A', 'Silva, Artur M S']","['Peixoto F', 'Barros AI', 'Silva AM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, 5001-911 Vila Real, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects/physiology', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/*drug effects', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.10042 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2002;16(5):220-6. doi: 10.1002/jbt.10042.,,,"[""0 (3'-allyl-4',5,7-trimethoxy-2-styrylchromone)"", '0 (Chromones)']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether this strategy could be applied to (a) limit the cytotoxic activity of a hyperfusogenic GALV therapeutic gene, and (b) enhance the immune-stimulatory properties of GALV via local, MMP-mediated release human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). METHODS: We generated GALV envelope expression constructs displaying EGF or GM-CSF blocking ligands at the N-terminus of GALV envelope SU via a non-cleavable, Factor Xa protease or MMP-cleavable linker and investigated their cytotoxicity on MMP-positive and negative cell lines. RESULTS: The unmodified hyperfusogenic GALV envelope was cytotoxic to all cell lines tested. The non-cleavable linker GALV envelope constructs caused no cytotoxicity, demonstrating efficient inhibition by the displayed domains. Moderate activation of fusion of the protease-cleavable linker constructs was observed in all cell lines, regardless of their level of MMP expression and of the specificity of the linker. High levels of the 'blocking domain' were detected in the cell supernatants due to dissociation of the surface unit (SU) from the transmembrane (TM) component of the GALV envelope glycoprotein TM. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike protease targeting in the context of retroviral vectors, protease activation of the cytotoxicity of GALV envelope by cleavage of a fusion blocking ligand at the cell surface does not appear to be specifically mediated by cell-surface MMPs. In addition, shedding of the SU-fusion protein from the TM limits the general applicability of this strategy for cancer gene therapy. Specificity of cell-cell fusion mediated by GALV envelope cannot be manipulated in the same fashion as virus-cell fusion.","['Kirkham, Lucy A', 'Bateman, Andrew R', 'Melcher, Alan A', 'Vile, Richard G', 'Fielding, Adele K']","['Kirkham LA', 'Bateman AR', 'Melcher AA', 'Vile RG', 'Fielding AK']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/05/29 05:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.306 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2002 Nov-Dec;4(6):592-600. doi: 10.1002/jgm.306.,,,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']","['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NBs are disorganized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia or during some viral infections, suggesting that PML NBs could be a part of cellular defense mechanism.

P and P2 are located in the cytoplasm, whereas P3, P4 and P5 are found mostly in the nucleus. Infection with rabies virus reorganized PML NBs. PML NBs became larger and appeared as dense aggregates when analysed by confocal or electron microscopy, respectively. The expression of P sequesters PML in the cytoplasm where both proteins colocalize, whereas that of P3 results in an increase in PML body size, as observed in infected cells. The P and P3 interacted directly in vivo and in vitro with PML. The C-terminal domain of P and the PML RING finger seem to be involved in this binding.

Several studies indicate that during erythroid differentiation TfR expression is highly dependent on transcriptional regulation. In this study we characterized the minimal region able to confer transcriptional regulation during erythroid differentiation in Friend leukemia cells (FLC). This region of 120 bp, upstream the transcription start site, contains an overlapping consensus recognition sequence for AP1/CREB/ATF transcription factors and for proteins of the Ets family and a GC rich region. Here, we report that both the Ets and the Ap1/CRE like sites are essential for promoter activity during erythroid differentiation. We showed that Ets-1 binds to the EBS-TfR and its binding activity decreases in FLC induced to differentiate and during normal erythroid differentiation. Consistent with this, FLC constitutively expressing Ets-1 show a decrease in TfR gene expression, globin mRNA and hemoglobin synthesis. We conclude that Ets-1 binding activity is modulated during erythroid maturation and that a deregulated expression of this transcription factor interferes with terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Marziali, Giovanna', 'Perrotti, Edvige', 'Ilari, Ramona', 'Lulli, Valentina', 'Coccia, Eliana M', 'Moret, Remy', 'Kuhn, Lukas C', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Battistini, Angela']","['Marziali G', 'Perrotti E', 'Ilari R', 'Lulli V', 'Coccia EM', 'Moret R', 'Kuhn LC', 'Testa U', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205925 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Nov 14;21(52):7933-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205925.,,,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a universally applicable polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of a human-specific 850-bp fragment of the alpha-satellite DNA on human chromosome 17. The method allows the detection of one human cell in 10(6) murine cells and could be established as both, a conventional DNA polymerase chain reaction-assay for routine screening, and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-assay using TaqMan-methodology. It was applied to the following xenotransplantation systems in SCID and NOD/SCID mice: (1) In a limiting dilution assay, cells of the MDA-MB 435 breast carcinoma were injected into the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice. It could be shown that 10 cells mouse(-1) were sufficient to induce a positive polymerase chain reaction signal in liver and lung tissue 30 days after transplantation as an indicator for micrometastasis. At this time a palpable tumour was not yet detectable in the mammary fat pad region. (2) Cells of a newly established human acute lymphatic leukaemia were administered intraperitoneally to SCID mice. These cells apparently disseminated and were detectable as early as day 50 in the peripheral blood of living mice, while the leukaemia manifestation was delayed by day 140. (3) In a transplantation experiment using mature human lymphocytes we wanted to standardise conditions for a successful survival of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. It was established that at least 5 x 10(7) cells given intravenously were necessary and that the mice had to be conditioned by 2 Gy body irradiation to get positive polymerase chain reaction bands in several organs. (4) Engraftment studies with blood stem cells originating from cytapheresis samples of tumour patients or from cord blood were undertaken in NOD/SCID mice in order to define conditions of successful engraftment and to use this model for further optimisation strategies. The polymerase chain reaction method presented allowed a reliable prediction of positive engraftment and agreed well with the results of immunohistochemical or FACS analysis. All together, the polymerase chain reaction method developed allows a sensitive and reliable detection of low numbers of human cells in immunodeficient hosts. In combination with real-time (TaqMan) technique it allows an exact quantification of human cells. As this method can be performed with accessible material of living animals, follow up studies for the monitoring of therapeutic interventions are possible in which the survival time of mice as evaluation criteria can be omitted.","['Becker, M', 'Nitsche, A', 'Neumann, C', 'Aumann, J', 'Junghahn, I', 'Fichtner, I']","['Becker M', 'Nitsche A', 'Neumann C', 'Aumann J', 'Junghahn I', 'Fichtner I']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10, 13092 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Survival', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation, Heterologous']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600573 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Nov 18;87(11):1328-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600573.,,,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)']",,,,,,PMC2408903,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurements were made in the homes of 473 children who were diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm between 1992 and 1996 and who were aged 0-14 at diagnosis, together with 453 controls matched on age, sex and geographical location. Exposure assessments comprised resultant spot measurements in the child's bedroom and the family living-room. Temporal stability of bedroom fields was investigated through continuous logging of the 48-h vertical component at the child's bedside supported by repeat spot measurements. The principal exposure metric used was the mean of the pillow and bed centre measurements. For the 273 cases and 276 controls with fully validated measures, comparing those with a measured electric field exposure >/=20 V m(-1) to those in a reference category of exposure <10 V m(-1), odds ratios of 1.31 (95% confidence interval 0.68-2.54) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.73-2.39) for total leukaemia, 2.12 (95% confidence interval 0.78-5.78) for central nervous system cancers and 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.77-2.07) for all malignancies were obtained. When considering the 426 cases and 419 controls with no invalid measures, the corresponding odds ratios were 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.49-1.51) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.56-1.54) for total leukaemia, 1.43 (95% confidence interval 0.68-3.02) for central nervous system cancers and 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.59-1.35) for all malignancies.

We conducted this study to assess prevalence and risk factors for human herpesvirus type 8 infection in Havana City, Cuba. Information and residual serum samples already collected for a hospital based case-control study were used. A total of 379 individuals (267 males and 112 females; median age=63 years) were evaluated. Antibodies to the lytic antigen of human herpesvirus type 8 were detected by using an immunofluorescence assay, while human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 serology was performed by means of an ELISA test (alpha Biotech). Overall, 64 subjects (16.9%, 95% confidence interval: 13.1-20.0) were positive for human herpesvirus type 8 antibodies. Human herpesvirus type 8 seroprevalence significantly increased with age (odds ratio=1.9 for >/=65 vs <55 years), and was twice as frequent in blacks than in whites. No association emerged with gender, socio-economic indicators, family size, history of sexually transmitted disease, sexual behaviour. Overall, 16 persons had anti-human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 antibodies (4.2%, 95% confidence interval: 2.2-6.4). No relationship emerged between human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 and human herpesvirus type 8 serostatus. The study findings indicate that human herpesvirus type 8 infection is relatively common in Havana City, Cuba, suggesting that Cuba may represent an intermediate endemical area.

Reports of changes in taste and smell appeared to parallel each other and changes remained at the time of the survey post-HCT. Change in taste appeared to be closely associated with dry mouth. Patients appeared to have difficulty in differentiating sour and bitter, which had been more affected than salt and sweet taste. Females appeared to report greater changes in taste than males. Increased smell sensitivity and taste change resulted in changes in food preparation in some cases, as did reported increase in sensitivity to sour and bitter taste. Acute complications are well known to affect QOL during the early period following HCT, but little assessment of long-term changes in oral QOL and taste has been conducted following transplant.

A limited number of polymorphisms in DOA and DOB were found, most of which are non-coding changes or result in a conserved amino acid change. A novel non-conserved Arg to Cys mutation in DOA was found in a patient suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Further analysis did not reveal any effect on the function of HLA-DO.

WT1 protein has been reported to be a promising tumor antigen in mouse and human. In the present study, a single amino-acid substitution, M-->Y, was introduced into the first anchor motif at position 2 of the natural immunogenic HLA-A*2402-restricted 9-mer WT1 peptide (CMTWNQMNL; a.a. 235-243). This substitution increased the binding affinity of the 9-mer WT1 peptide to HLA-A*2402 molecules from 1.82 x 10(-5) to 6.40 x 10(-7) M. As expected from the increased binding affinity, the modified 9-mer WT1 peptide (CYTWNQMNL) elicited WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) more effectively than the natural 9-mer WT1 peptide from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HLA-A*2402-positive healthy volunteers.

These results showed that this modified 9-mer WT1 peptide was more immunogenic for the induction of WT1-specific CTL than the natural 9-mer WT1 peptide, and that CTL induced by the modified 9-mer WT1 peptide could effectively recognize and kill tumor cells with endogenous WT1 expression. Therefore, cancer immunotherapy using this modified 9-mer WT1 peptide should provide efficacious treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive patients with leukemias and solid tumors.","['Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Udaka, Keiko', 'Murakami, Masaki', 'Masuda, Tomoki', 'Nakano, Akiko', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Hiraki, Akio', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Fujioka, Tatsuya', 'Wu, Fei', 'Taniguchi, Yuki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Asada, Momotaro', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Tsuboi A', 'Oka Y', 'Udaka K', 'Murakami M', 'Masuda T', 'Nakano A', 'Nakajima H', 'Yasukawa M', 'Hiraki A', 'Oji Y', 'Kawakami M', 'Hosen N', 'Fujioka T', 'Wu F', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Nishida S', 'Asada M', 'Ogawa H', 'Kawase I', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['HLA-A Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-002-0328-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2002 Dec;51(11-12):614-20. doi: 10.1007/s00262-002-0328-9.

Interindividual differences in lymphoblast accumulation of MTX and its active metabolites, methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), may contribute to the effectiveness of treatment among ALL subtypes. To better understand these differences in MTXPG accumulation, we developed a model to characterize the cellular influx and efflux of MTX, formation of MTXPG by the addition of glutamyl residues catalyzed by FPGS (folylpolyglutamate synthetase), and cleavage of glutamyl residues from MTXPG by GGH (gamma-glutamyl hydrolase). The model was fitted to in vivo intracellular MTXPG concentrations measured serially in leukemic blasts from 20 newly diagnosed patients with ALL treated with 24-h intravenous infusions of MTX. The observed median concentrations of total MTXPG at 44 h was higher in B-lineage than in T-cell ALL (1706 vs 518 pmol/10(9) cells, P<0.025), consistent with the higher estimated Vmax for FPGS activity in B-lineage vs T-lineage blasts (414 vs 93 pmol/10(9) cells/h, P<0.008). Simulations based on the model-estimated parameters indicated greater accumulation of MTX, MTXPGs (MTXPG(2-7)) and total MTX (MTXPG(1-7)) with longer MTX infusions and with higher MTX doses, with the highest concentrations in hyperdiploid B-lineage, intermediate in non-hyperdiploid B-lineage, and lowest in T-cell ALL. These differences provide mechanistic and treatment insights for lineage and ploidy differences in MTXPG accumulation in human leukemia cells in vivo.","['Panetta, John Carl', 'Yanishevski, Yuri', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Panetta JC', 'Yanishevski Y', 'Pui CH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rubnitz J', 'Rivera GK', 'Ribeiro R', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale St., Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacokinetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0511-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;50(5):419-28. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0511-x.

Plasma and dialysate concentrations of 2-CdA were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rate of this patient's 2-CdA clearance was lower than the rates reported for children with normal renal function. The average clearance rate, reflecting systemic clearance and clearance by continuous venovenous hemofiltration and hemodialysis, was 12.4 L/hour per m for the first 3 days of 2-CdA therapy. He did not experience untoward hematologic toxicity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The amount of accumulated methotrexate and of long-chain methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG(3-7)) by lymphoblasts was determined in 52 children newly diagnosed with BCP-ALL after incubation with 1 micromol/L [(3)H]MTX for 24 hours in vitro. All patients then received intensive multiagent chemotherapy that used divided-dose oral methotrexate during consolidation and intensive continuation and standard oral weekly methotrexate during maintenance. RESULTS: Eight patients had a bone marrow relapse at a median of 40.4 months (range 18.5-48.3 months) after diagnosis. The median follow-up for the remaining 44 patients is 69.0 months (range 22-92.8 months). There was no significant difference in the amount of accumulated methotrexate (1450.0 +/- 896.3 vs. 640 +/- 472.5 pmol/10 cells) or of accumulated MTXPG (1450.0 +/- 919.4 vs. 617.4 +/- 482.7 pmol/10(9) cells) (median +/- semi-interquartile ranges) between patients who relapsed and those who remained in continuous complete remission. The estimated 5-year event-free survival rate for patients whose lymphoblasts accumulated more than 500 pmol MTXPG(3-7)/10(9) cells was 80.0% +/- 7.3% versus 90.5% +/- 6.4% for those whose lymphoblasts accumulated less than 500 pmol MTXPG(3-7)/10(9) cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of effective prolonged divided-dose oral methotrexate-based therapy in the treatment of BCP-ALL, methotrexate accumulation and polyglutamation no longer seem to have prognostic significance.","['Mantadakis, Elpis', 'Smith, Angela K', 'Hynan, Linda', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Kamen, Barton A']","['Mantadakis E', 'Smith AK', 'Hynan L', 'Winick NJ', 'Kamen BA']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic, PEPAGNI University Hospital of Iraklio, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Karyotyping', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200211000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Nov;24(8):636-42. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200211000-00007.,,,"['0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Dec;24(9):704-5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In Children's Cancer Group study 2891, patients were given intensively timed induction with G-CSF (n = 254) after accrual for the regimen without G-CSF (n = 258) was met. RESULTS: Time to neutropenic recovery after induction courses 1 and 2 was significantly shorter for patients who received G-CSF. Times to platelet recovery were similar regardless of G-CSF use. Effects on incidence of grades 3 and 4 toxicities, infections, or fatal infections were not observed. Use of G-CSF reduced the median length of induction by 9 days and hospital stay by 6 days. Induction remission rates, overall survival, and event-free survival were similar with and without G-CSF. Day 7 bone marrow was prognostic of better long-term outcome. Patients with hypercellular day 7 marrow who received G-CSF had a higher remission rate and event-free survival than patients who did not receive G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of severe toxic event and infection, induction remission rate, overall survival, and event-free survival were comparable regardless of G-CSF use.

In contrast, re-addition of serum increased alpha-importin expression. We analyzed two models for cell differentiation and found differential importin regulation. Stimulation of rat pancreatic AR42J cell differentiation towards a neuroendocrine phenotype with activin A or towards an acinar phenotype with dexamethasone, caused strong upregulation of importin alpha3 and alpha4 expression. Phorbol ester-induced differentiation of human leukemia (HL60) cells towards a macrophage phenotype led to downregulation of importin alpha1 and alpha4 expression after 72 hours.

Here, we observe that purified RINGs from a variety of functionally unrelated proteins, including promyelocytic leukemia protein, KAP-1TIF1beta, Z, Mel18, breast cancer susceptibility gene product 1 (BRCA1), and BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1), self-assemble into supramolecular structures in vitro that resemble those they form in cells. RING bodies form polyvalent binding surfaces and scaffold multiple partner proteins. Separation of RING bodies from monomers reveals that self-assembly controls and amplifies their specific activities in two unrelated biochemistries: reduction of 5' mRNA cap affinity of eIF4E by promyelocytic leukemia protein and Z, and E3 ubiquitin conjugation activity of BARD1:BRCA1. Functional significance of self-assembly is underscored by partial restoration of assembly and E3 activity of cancer predisposing BRCA1 mutant by forced oligomerization. RING self-assembly creates bodies that act structurally as polyvalent scaffolds, thermodynamically by amplifying activities of partner proteins, and catalytically by spatiotemporal coupling of enzymatic reactions. These studies reveal a general paradigm of how supramolecular structures may function in cells.","['Kentsis, Alex', 'Gordon, Ronald E', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Kentsis A', 'Gordon RE', 'Borden KL']","['Structural Biology Program, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'BRCA1 Protein/chemistry/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Catalysis', 'Cattle', 'Cells/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/chemistry/metabolism', 'Genes, BRCA1', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Ligases/chemistry/metabolism', '*Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/*physiology', 'RNA Caps/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/physiology', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin/chemistry/metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Zinc/physiology']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.202608799 [doi]', '202608799 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 26;99(24):15404-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.202608799.

Mutant viruses with a C-terminally truncated TFP (19, 32, or 50 residues) had essentially a wild-type phenotype in vitro. However, a virus mutant that encoded only the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins due to a mutation in the second frameshift site, and hence did not produce TFP, was noninfectious. Mutation analysis of the proteolytic cleavage site between PR and TFP revealed the presence of an additional site and the existence of a p1 peptide separating protease and TFP. While removal of the cleavage site at the PR-p1 junction had a modest effect on virus replication, mutation of the p1-TFP cleavage site led to noninfectious virus and the loss of reverse transcriptase activity. Determination of the amino-terminal sequence of a hemagglutinin-tagged RT demonstrated that the same site is used in processing the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor and thus defines the start of mature RT.

We show here that HBZ is able to interact with the bZIP transcription factor CREB-2 (also called ATF-4), known to activate the HTLV-1 transcription by recruiting the viral trans-activator Tax on the Tax-responsive elements (TxREs). However, we demonstrate that the HBZ/CREB-2 heterodimers are no more able to bind to the TxRE and cyclic AMP response element sites.

To address the need for more efficient gene delivery systems, we have developed replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors based on murine leukemia virus (MLV). We have previously shown that such vectors are capable of transducing solid tumors in vivo with very high efficiency. While the natural requirement of MLV infection for cell division imparts a certain degree of specificity for tumor cells, additional means for confining RCR vector replication to tumor cells are desirable. Here, we investigated the parameters critical for successful tissue-specific transcriptional control of RCR vector replication by replacing various lengths of the MLV enhancer/promoter with sequences derived either from the highly prostate-specific probasin (PB) promoter or from a more potent synthetic variant of the PB promoter. We assessed the transcriptional specificity of the resulting hybrid long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the cell type specificity and efficiency of replication of vectors containing these LTRs. Incorporation of PB promoter sequences effectively restricted transcription from the LTR to prostate-derived cells and imparted prostate-specific RCR vector replication but required the stronger synthetic promoter and retention of native MLV sequences in the vicinity of the TATA box for optimal replicative efficiency and specificity. Our results have thus identified promoter strength and positioning within the LTR as important determinants for achieving both high transduction efficiency and strict cell type specificity in transcriptionally targeted RCR vectors.","['Logg, Christopher R', 'Logg, Aki', 'Matusik, Robert J', 'Bochner, Bernard H', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Logg CR', 'Logg A', 'Matusik RJ', 'Bochner BH', 'Kasahara N']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 2250 Alcazar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Androgen-Binding Protein/genetics', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Organ Specificity', 'Prostate/metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Replication']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.24.12783-12791.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Dec;76(24):12783-91. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.24.12783-12791.2002.,,,"['0 (Androgen-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (probasin)']",,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 85908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC136666,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that although the HTLV receptor(s) are widely expressed on cell lines of various cell types from different species, cell lines differ dramatically in their susceptibility to HTLV-Env-mediated fusion. Human cells (293, HeLa, and primary CD4(+) T cells) showed higher levels of binding at saturation than rodent (NIH 3T3 and NRK) cells to an HTLV-1 SU immunoadhesin. A direct comparison of the binding of the HTLV-1 surface glycoprotein (SU) immunoadhesin and transduction by HTLV-1 pseudotyped virus revealed parallels between the level of binding and the titer for various cell lines. When cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which down-modulates a number of cell surface molecules, the level of SU binding was markedly reduced. However, PMA treatment only slightly reduced the titer of murine leukemia virus(HTLV-1) on both highly susceptible and poorly susceptible cells.

Polycations, which enhance the infectivity of several other retroviruses, inhibited HTLV-1 Env-mediated binding and entry on both human and rodent cells.

Although the exact sequence of events leading to the development of ATL remains incompletely resolved, expression of the integrated HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is likely required at some point during the process of T-cell transformation. While much has been learned about the regulated expression of transiently transfected LTR reporter plasmids, an analysis of factors required for expression of chromosomally integrated HTLV-1 LTR has not been done. Here, we have constructed CHOK1 and HeLa cells that contain an integrated HTLV-1 LTR-luciferase gene. Using these cells, we have compared the requirements for activation of transiently transfected versus stably integrated HTLV-1 LTR. We observed different requirements for CREB, p300, and P/CAF in the expression of transiently transfected versus stably integrated HTLV-1 LTR. Furthermore, with dominant-negative mutants of CREB, p300, and P/CAF, we found that activation of integrated HTLV-1 LTR by an ambient stress signal, UV-C, proceeds through a path mechanistically distinct from that used by viral oncoprotein, Tax. Our findings point to additional complexities in the regulated expression of HTLV-1 proviruses compared with those hitherto revealed through transfection studies.","['Okada, Masahiko', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh']","['Okada M', 'Jeang KT']","['Molecular Virology Section, Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/physiology', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', '*Virus Activation', '*Virus Integration', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.24.12564-12573.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Dec;76(24):12564-73. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.24.12564-12573.2002.,,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",,,,,,PMC136657,,,,,,,,,,,

The most relevant clinical example is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which responds dramatically to either retinoic acid (RA) or arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)). In many myeloid leukemia cell lines, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) triggers growth arrest, cell death, or differentiation, often in synergy with RA. Nevertheless, the toxicity of cAMP derivatives and lack of suitable models has hampered trials designed to assess the in vivo relevance of theses observations. We show that, in an APL cell line, cAMP analogs blocked cell growth and unraveled As(2)O(3)-triggered differentiation. Similarly, in RA-sensitive or RA-resistant mouse models of APL, continuous infusions of 8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP) triggered major growth arrest, greatly enhanced both spontaneous and RA- or As(2)O(3)-induced differentiation and accelerated the restoration of normal hematopoiesis. Theophylline, a well-tolerated phosphodiesterase inhibitor which stabilizes endogenous cAMP, also impaired APL growth and enhanced spontaneous or As(2)O(3)-triggered cell differentiation in vivo. Accordingly, in an APL patient resistant to combined RA-As(2)O(3) therapy, theophylline induced blast clearance and restored normal hematopoiesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in vivo activation of cAMP signaling contributes to APL clearance, independently of its RA-sensitivity, thus raising hopes that other myeloid leukemias may benefit from this therapeutic approach.","['Guillemin, Marie-Claude', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Vitoux, Dominique', 'Kogan, Scott', 'Soilihi, Hassane', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Janin, Anne', 'Daniel, Marie-Therese', 'Gourmel, Bernard', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Lanotte, Michel', 'De The, Hugues']","['Guillemin MC', 'Raffoux E', 'Vitoux D', 'Kogan S', 'Soilihi H', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Zhu J', 'Janin A', 'Daniel MT', 'Gourmel B', 'Degos L', 'Dombret H', 'Lanotte M', 'De The H']","[""CNRS UPR 9051, Laboratoire Associe au Comite de Paris de la Ligue contre le Cancer, affilie a l'Universite de ParisVII, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oxides/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.20021129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2002 Nov 18;196(10):1373-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.20021129.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,PMC2193985,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of Mcl-1, a potent antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, has also been reported in cholangiocarcinomas. Because receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR may modulate antiapoptotic protein expression, we examined the hypothesis that bile acids modulate Mcl-1 expression levels via EGFR. Deoxycholate increased cellular Mcl-1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner. The deoxycholate-mediated increase of cellular Mcl-1 protein was blocked equally by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or an EGFR-neutralizing antibody. Although inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases did not attenuate the deoxycholate-associated increase in Mcl-1 protein, the Raf-1 inhibitor, BAY 37-9751, effectively blocked the cellular increase of this protein. Neither Mcl-1 transcriptional activity nor its mRNA stability was altered by deoxycholate treatment. However, Mcl-1 protein stability was increased by bile acid treatment, an effect duplicated by proteasome inhibition. Deoxycholate prolongation of Mcl-1 turnover was blocked by either EGFR inhibitors or the Raf-1 inhibitor. Whereas the deoxycholate-induced increase in Mcl-1 reduced Fas-mediated apoptosis, the Raf-1 inhibitor potentiated Fas apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that bile acids block Mcl-1 protein degradation via activation of an EGFR/Raf-1 cascade resulting in its cellular accumulation. Raf-1 inhibitors block this increase of Mcl-1 and render the cells more susceptible to apoptosis, a potential therapeutic strategy for cholangiocarcinomas.","['Yoon, Jung-Hwan', 'Werneburg, Nathan W', 'Higuchi, Hajime', 'Canbay, Ali E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Akgul, Cahit', 'Edwards, Steven W', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Yoon JH', 'Werneburg NW', 'Higuchi H', 'Canbay AE', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Akgul C', 'Edwards SW', 'Gores GJ']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Medical School, Clinic, and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Deoxycholic Acid/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/20 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Nov 15;62(22):6500-5.,,,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK59427/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments have shown that many leukaemic cells are NK-cell sensitive. Nevertheless, no data concerning the influence of purified NK cells on malignant myeloma (MM) cells exist. We co-incubated NK cells with three different MM cell lines and fresh bone marrow samples of nine MM patients. The proportion of vital MM cells was determined before and after co-cultivation by a flow-cytometry-based assay. All MM cells tested, with the exception of one cell line (NCI H929), were susceptible to a NK-cell attack even without exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). The mean killing of the native MM samples was 23.1 +/- 5.4% and 34.5 +/- 6.5% at 10:1 and 20:1 effector:target ratio respectively, This corresponded to about 2/3 of those values obtained with the highly sensitive line K562. In contrast, CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells as well as peripheral mononuclear cells were completely resistant under similar experimental conditions (1.3% killing). To elucidate the underlying triggering mechanisms, we measured human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-class I expression of the MM cells. No evidence for HLA loss, which could have explained the NK-cell recognition if it occurred, was demonstrated. These findings may contribute to the understanding of in vivo NK-cell activation and encourage clinical applications of NK cells for MM patients.","['Frohn, Christoph', 'Hoppner, Maike', 'Schlenke, Peter', 'Kirchner, Holger', 'Koritke, Petra', 'Luhm, Jurgen']","['Frohn C', 'Hoppner M', 'Schlenke P', 'Kirchner H', 'Koritke P', 'Luhm J']","['Institute of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, MHC Class I/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['3879 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03879.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(3):660-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03879.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have investigated its effects towards human lymphoid malignant cells and compared them with those of arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Like As2O3, PAT was found to inhibit cell growth of various lymphoid cell lines, deriving from either acute lymphoid leukaemias (Jurkat, Molt-4 and Nalm-6) or lymphomas (Daudi, Raji and Rec1). PAT toxicity was linked, at least in part, to induction of apoptosis in both Daudi and Jurkat cells, which was dependent on caspase activity. This apoptotic process was also associated, similarly to that triggered by As2O3, with loss of mitochondrial potential and enhanced cellular production of reactive oxygen-related species. It was enhanced by co-treatment with the pro-oxidant buthionine sulphoximine and abolished in response to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, thus underlining that PAT toxicity, similarly to that of As2O3, is probably modulated by the redox status of the cells. PAT, used at concentrations in the micromolar range that are thought to be clinically achievable, was also demonstrated to markedly decrease the viability of primary cultured tumoral B cells that originated from 18 patients suffering from chronic lymphoid leukaemia whereas normal lymphocytes were less sensitive. These data therefore suggest that PAT may deserve to be evaluated in the treatment of some lymphoid malignancies.","['Lecureur, Valerie', 'Le Thiec, Aurelien', 'Le Meur, Alexandre', 'Amiot, Laurence', 'Drenou, Bernard', 'Bernard, Marc', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Fauchet, Renee', 'Fardel, Olivier']","['Lecureur V', 'Le Thiec A', 'Le Meur A', 'Amiot L', 'Drenou B', 'Bernard M', 'Lamy T', 'Fauchet R', 'Fardel O']","['INSERM U456, Faculte de Pharmacie, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antimony Potassium Tartrate/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Coumarins/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/20 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/11/20 04:00'],"['2002/11/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['3863 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03863.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(3):608-15. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03863.x.,,,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-amino-4-methylcoumarin)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'DL6OZ476V3 (Antimony Potassium Tartrate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Argentine Group of Bone Marrow Transplantation (GATMO) experience.,2339-45,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the role of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in prolonging disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who received autografts of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive or Ph negative cell harvests. METHODS: Over a 4-year period (1994-1999), 53 patients who underwent ASCT for CML were reported to the Argentine Group of Bone Marrow Transplantation (GATMO) Registry. RESULTS: Ph negative cell products were harvested in only 18 patients (34%). Comparison of disease status at the time of autograft, duration of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, days of antibiotics, and transfusional requirements of red blood cells and platelets did not reveal statistical significant differences between the Ph positive group and the Ph negative group. Only days of hospitalization were increased significantly in patients who received Ph positive autografts. Although DFS at 36 months was significantly longer after infusion of Ph negative cell products (54% vs. 14%; P <or= 0.005), OS differences between the Ph negative group and the Ph positive group (68% vs. 53%; P <or= 0.134) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: ASCT with Ph negative cell harvests after myeloablative chemotherapy resulted in prolonged periods of hematologic and cytogenetic remission or stable disease after cytogenetic/molecular recurrence in some patients with CML. A superior DFS was observed without any benefit observed for OS.","['Koziner, Benjamin', 'Dengra, Cristina', 'Lucero, Graciela', 'Klein, Graciela', 'Canepa, Carlos', 'Milovic, Vera', 'Milone, Gustavo', 'Robinson, Anibal', 'Cerutti, Ider', 'Saporito, Graciela', 'Kusminsky, Gustavo', 'Milone, Jorge', 'Bordone, Javier', 'Lastiri, Francisco']","['Koziner B', 'Dengra C', 'Lucero G', 'Klein G', 'Canepa C', 'Milovic V', 'Milone G', 'Robinson A', 'Cerutti I', 'Saporito G', 'Kusminsky G', 'Milone J', 'Bordone J', 'Lastiri F']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Instituto Argentino de Diagnostico y Tratamiento, Buenos Aires, Argentina. bkoziner@netizen.com.ar']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/19 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10931 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Dec 1;95(11):2339-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10931.,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.10931'],,,,,,['Argentine Group of Bone Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,

Clonal selection of a stem cell as a first step in the progression to neoplasia can be achieved by an alteration of this self-renewal potency. Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders including acute myeloid leukemias, chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), is based on the assumption that they represent a clonal disorder resulting from transformation of a hematopoietic stem cell. However, when performing methods for determining X-chromosome inactivation in female patients as a clonality marker, a significant minority of the patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph(-)) CMPD and MDS exhibit polyclonal proliferation. The implications of these results are not yet clarified and the lack of a proven target cell impairs the understanding of the underlying molecular defect. In this context, altered response to cytokine stimulation in vitro provides indirect information concerning molecular dysregulation. A subset of patients with MPD present with translocations that facilitate molecular investigation and clonality proof. They nearly always result in rearrangements of at least one transcription factor gene. Most of these fusion genes are constitutively active, sending out continuous proliferative and antiapoptotic signals or activate an overlapping set of signalling pathways. The classical example for a balanced translocation is the t(9;22) bcr-abl aberration in chronic myelogeneous leukemia.

An increase in immature and dysplastic granulocytes in the blood films at presentation accompanied by granulocytic dysplasia, is the most important diagnostic parameter of aCML. On the other hand, CMML is characterized by absolute monocytosis and, as explicitly outlined by the WHO classification, may show myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features. However, in the absence of characteristic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities for both diseases, a minority of patients still remain who are difficult to assign to a distinctive entity, since they either show overlapping features or do not fulfill the whole set of diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, controversy and discussion arise about aCML with monocytosis and its association to CMML. Finally, leukemoid reactions and the very rarely encountered chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) should be considered in patients with chronic leukocytosis.

A synoptical diagnostic approach relying on immunophenotypic as well as on molecular biological criteria aside from histomorphology (cytomorphology), is of utmost importance for the subtyping of malignant lymphomas. This too can be done reliably on bone marrow biopsies, as comparative studies have yielded a concordance rate of more than 90% with lymphoma typing on corresponding lymph nodes. Cytology and the pattern of infiltrates, (i.e. diffuse, interstitial, nodular peritrabecular and intrasinusoidal), in combination with immunological phenotyping are the mainstays for subtyping, giving clear-cut decisions in most cases of small B-cell lymphoma, mantle zone as well as marginal cell and follicular lymphomas and hairy cell leukemia. Among the blastic variants the most important are the lymphoblastic lymphomas of either B- or T-cell type which have to be discerned from AML and the so-called blastoid mantle cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas are rare compared to B-cell lymphomas.

As a consequence innovative therapeutic strategies have been suggested to possibly ameliorate the outcome of coronary artery disease. However, there is no information available at present whether this pathomechanism is also effective in humans, in particular without prior ischemic lesion of the myocardium. Therefore an autopsy study was performed on cadaver hearts derived from five male patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who received full unmanipulated bone marrow grafts from female donors 21-631 days before death. The purpose of this investigation was to detect and quantify a putative chimerism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells (intramural and subepicardial vessels). Genotyping was carried out by applying X- or Y-chromosome-specific DNA probes (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation) on routinely formalin-fixed specimens of the myocardium. To test the sensitivity of our method, cadaver hearts from two males and two females without a history of transplantation served as controls. In contrast to a totally corresponding sex-matched genotyping in 780 cardiomyocytes and 155 endothelial cells of the control group, the five male patients with a previous transplantation revealed significantly different results. A mixed chimerism was identifiable in 57 out of 890 counted cardiomyocytes (6.4%) and in 19 out of 322 endothelial cells (5.8%). These findings support the assumption that in addition to endothelial cells there is also a cardiomyogenic potential of bone marrow stem cells which exists without prior (ischemic) damage to the heart. However, further investigations are necessary to identify, isolate and enrich the cardiomyocytic stem cells more specifically for future curative therapeutic options in patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.","['Thiele, J', 'Varus, E', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Metz, K', 'Schaefer, U W', 'Beelen, D W']","['Thiele J', 'Varus E', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Metz K', 'Schaefer UW', 'Beelen DW']","['Zentrum fur Pathologie, Universitat zu Koln, Joseph-Stelzmann-Strasse 9, 50924 Koln, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,IM,"['Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*pathology', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Muscle Cells/*pathology', 'Myocardium/*pathology', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00292-002-0573-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2002 Nov;23(6):405-10. doi: 10.1007/s00292-002-0573-x.

However, even more rarely, primary myelosarcomas may precede AML by months or years or may be associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that never progress to manifest leukemia. In a retrospective evaluation a clinicopathological study on these latter two variants of isolated extramedullary manifestations of AML was performed to elucidate certain aspects of site involvement and histopathology by application of enzyme and immunohistochemistry. For this reason, we selected 6 patients presenting with a myelosarcoma in combination with MDS and 12 patients revealing only uncharacteristic reactive changes of the bone marrow.

Focal leukemic infiltrates were most often localized in the skin ( n=4), oral mucosa ( n=4), lymph nodes ( n=3), gastrointestinal tract ( n=3) or pleura and retroperitoneum ( n=3 each).

Although at that time bone marrow findings were inconclusive, a straightforward diagnosis was reached by considering the possibility of a (primary) myelosarcoma in these patients.","['Schmitt-Graff, A', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Dries, V', 'Thiele, J']","['Schmitt-Graff A', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Dries V', 'Thiele J']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Albertstrasse 19, 79104 Freiburg, Germany. ahsg@sun11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00292-002-0572-y [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2002 Nov;23(6):397-404. doi: 10.1007/s00292-002-0572-y.

Qualitative research methodology based on open-ended interviews with 12 survivors of haematological malignancies was used. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using the NUD*IST computer package. The preliminary findings from the study indicate a need for the development of a new language for articulating spirituality. The present discussion is an introductory attempt to begin to explore the notion of, and language for, the idea of 'spiritual pain'. The findings indicate that individuals need a strong sense of meaning-making and connection with life to be able to deal with the demands of aggressive, invasive treatments. Such a connection can be threatened by a break with the normal or expected relationships and satisfaction with life through physical, identity, relational and existential challenges and losses. When the disconnection is acutely painful (a subjective phenomenon depending on the individual) it then is experienced as spiritual pain, creating a void that challenges the individual's ability to derive any meaning from their existence. This study is seen as preliminary work, the first step in a series of articles aimed at beginning to develop, through research, a language of spiritual care.","['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],"[""Leukaemia Foundation's Psycho-social Research Program, Department of Religion, School of History, Philosophy, Religion and Classics, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia. pam.mcgrath@bigpond.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude to Death', '*Attitude to Health', '*Communication', 'Existentialism/psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Identity Crisis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*psychology', 'Social Isolation/psychology', 'Social Support', '*Spirituality', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0360-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2002 Nov;10(8):637-46. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0360-5.

However, utility scores, which reflect quality of life, have not been objectively defined for parameters such as emesis. The Standard Gamble technique identifies utility by determining patient preference for retaining a fixed intermediate health state or taking a gamble with perfect health and death as possible outcomes (the odds of the two gamble outcomes can be varied). If death is not a reasonable negative anchor (for example, with transient symptoms of treatment), then a surrogate negative anchor that is itself defined according to a perfect health/death gamble may be used. We explored use of the Standard Gamble to define a reasonable surrogate negative anchor for evaluation of the impact of emesis. Ten normal volunteers performed a Standard Gamble exercise in which the fixed health state was a year of chemotherapy followed by survival in good health and the gamble had possible outcomes of perfect health or immediate death. The amount of nausea/vomiting during chemotherapy (continuous or none) and the duration of overall survival (6 years or 2 years) were varied to produce four unique health states. All subjects completed the exercise and demonstrated construct validity. Mean utility scores ranged from 0.89 for 6-year survival/no emesis to 0.46 for 2-year survival/continuous emesis. Presence of emesis significantly affected utility (0.565 vs 0.88), while shorter survival had a lesser effect (0.67 vs 0.78). The Standard Gamble technique can be used to evaluate nausea and vomiting. The fixed health state of 1 year of chemotherapy with continuous nausea and vomiting followed by 1 year of good health defines a utility score of 0.46. This is a reasonable negative surrogate anchor and is being used in a current Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study.","['Grunberg, Steven M', 'Srivastava, Alka', 'Grunberg, Kelly J', 'Weeks, Jane']","['Grunberg SM', 'Srivastava A', 'Grunberg KJ', 'Weeks J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Fletcher Allen HealthCare, University of Vermont, UHC Campus/St. Joseph 3400, 1 South Prospect Street, Burlington, VT 05401, USA. sgrunber@zoo.uvm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Attitude to Death', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced/psychology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/*psychology', 'Patient Simulation', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/*psychology']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0381-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2002 Nov;10(8):624-9. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0381-0.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors, G-CSF support allows dose intensification of chemotherapy. On the other hand, each G-CSF injection causes pain and costs. We set up the hypothesis that besides strategies as restricted indications, delayed start, lower doses, and stringent rules for discontinuation, individualized timing of blood count might optimize G-CSF prophylaxis. We randomized 64 cycles of G-CSF prophylaxis in eight children and adolescents being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or solid tumors to standard twice a week or to individually timed blood counts. Primary study endpoints were the numbers of G-CSF doses and of blood counts, and the total costs of G-CSF support. Per cycle, individual timing of blood count resulted in a median of one G-CSF injection fewer [estimated population median (EPM) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-2.20] and one blood count fewer (EPM 1.00, 95% CI 0.74-1.33). The total costs of G-CSF support and of blood counts were thereby reduced by a median of US $ 152 per cycle (EPM 191, 95% CI 97-318). The results of this study suggest that individual timing of blood counts during prophylactic G-CSF support in children and adolescents undergoing chemotherapy for malignant disease can significantly reduce the number of injections and blood counts performed, thus resulting in less pain and lower costs. These findings need confirmation in a larger randomized trial.","['Ammann, Roland A', 'Leibundgut, Kurt', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Ridolfi Luthy, Annette']","['Ammann RA', 'Leibundgut K', 'Hirt A', 'Ridolfi Luthy A']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland. roland.ammann@insel.ch""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count/economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/economics', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Time Factors']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0365-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2002 Nov;10(8):613-8. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0365-0.

This paper gives an overview of the results of studies into the quality of life (QL) of young adult survivors of childhood cancer and suggest areas for future research. The review located 30 empirical studies published up to 2001. The results are described in terms of the following QL dimensions: physical functioning (QL, general health), psychological functioning (overall emotional functioning, depression and anxiety, self-esteem), social functioning (education, employment, insurance, living situation, marital status and family), and sexual functioning. Factors related to survivors' QL are reported: demographics and illness- and treatment related variables. Although the literature yields some inconsistent findings, a number of clear trends can be identified: (a) most survivors reported being in good health, with the exception of some bone tumour survivors; (b) most survivors function well psychologically; (c) survivors of CNS tumours and survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are at risk for educational deficits; (d) job discrimination, difficulties in obtaining work and problems in obtaining health and life insurance were reported; (e) survivors have lower rates of marriage and parenthood; (f) survivors worry about their reproductive capacity and/or about future health problems their children might experience as a result of their cancer history. There is a need for methodological studies that measure QL among survivors of childhood cancer more precisely by taking into account the effects of the severity of the cancer and the long-term impact of different treatments. Additional data are needed to help us understand the needs of survivors and to identify those subgroups of survivors who are at greatest risk for the adverse sequelae of the disease and its treatment.","['Langeveld, N E', 'Stam, H', 'Grootenhuis, M A', 'Last, B F']","['Langeveld NE', 'Stam H', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Last BF']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Kinderziekenhuis, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands. n.e.langeveld@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Sexuality/psychology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0388-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2002 Nov;10(8):579-600. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0388-6.

The major types of cancer were ranked in order of relative frequency. The crude incidence rate and age standardized rate were then calculated. RESULTS: The age standardized rate in Al-Jouf was 38.5 per 100,000, a figure lower than the Saudi Arabian national average of 71.7 per 100,000 and lower than the lowest published international figure of 39.6 from Gambia. The most common cancers in the whole population irrespective of sex were carcinoma of the breast, lymphoma and leukemia combined and colorectal cancer. The most common cancers in females in Al Jouf were those of the breast, thyroid, and lymphomas and leukemia combined. Comparative findings for males were lymphomas and leukemias combined, colorectal and skin cancers. CONCLUSION: The incidence of cancer in Al Jouf region appears to be the lowest incidence published to date. The over all pattern of cancer is however similar to the findings in other regions of KSA. Carcinoma of breast, lymphomas and leukemias, and colorectal cancers are the leading cancers in the region.","['El Hag, Imad A', 'Katchabeswaran, Ramesh', 'Chiedozi, Lawrence C', 'Kollur, Sharanamma M']","['El Hag IA', 'Katchabeswaran R', 'Chiedozi LC', 'Kollur SM']","['Department of Pathology, Prince Abdulrahman Al-Sudairy Central Hospital, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. imadum12@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology']",2002/11/19 04:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2002 Oct;23(10):1210-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This signaling is critically dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and p53/p56 Lyn activation. In this study, we have investigated the influence of protein kinase C (PKC) zeta overexpression on the SM-CER pathway in U937 human leukemia cell line. We show that PKCzeta overexpression resulted in delayed apoptosis and significant resistance to both 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR), but there was no significant protection against cell-permeant C(6)-CER. Moreover, PKCzeta overexpression abrogated drug-induced neutral sphingomyelinase stimulation and CER generation by inhibiting ROS production. We further investigated p53/p56 Lyn activation in PKCzeta-overexpressing U937 cells treated with ara-C or DNR. We demonstrate that PKCzeta inhibited p53/p56 Lyn phosphorylation and stimulation in drug- or H(2)O(2)-treated cells, suggesting that p53/p56 Lyn redox regulation is altered in PKCzeta-overexpressing cells. Finally, we show that PKCzeta-overexpressing U937 cells displayed accelerated H(2)O(2) detoxification.

The role of paclitaxel and docetaxel in the adjuvant setting has attracted a great deal of attention. Both of these agents are highly active in patients with advanced breast cancer. In addition, they can be utilized in combination with anthracyclines, which have been shown to provide a slightly better outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer compared to non-anthracycline-containing regimens. Randomized trials have demonstrated a potential role for paclitaxel in adjuvant chemotherapy. In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9344 trial, which explored the use of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without paclitaxel, the initial analysis demonstrated a 22% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 26% reduction in the relative risk of death in the paclitaxel group.

We report the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in 34 patients treated with Campath-1H for relapsed or refractory CLL and PLL. All patients received infection prophylaxis during therapy and continuing for at least 2 months following Campath-1H. Five patients (15%) developed CMV viremia at a median of 28 days (range, 20-30 days) after the first dose of Campath-1H. The median CMV viral load was 860/mL (range, 420-2100/mL), as determined by quantitative plasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All 5 patients had a temperature > 38.5 degrees C, normal chest radiographs, normal liver function tests, and negative bacterial blood cultures with no clinical evidence of CMV disease at the time of presentation with CMV viremia. The median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 740/ microL (range, 340-1600/ microL), and the median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 16/microL (range, 11-169/ microL) for the 5 patients at the time of CMV viremia. All 5 patients received ganciclovir therapy followed by prompt fever resolution and clearance of CMV viremia by plasma PCR. By univariate regression analysis, the following were not risk factors for CMV viremia: age, number of prior regimens, prior rituximab therapy, prior splenectomy, modified Rai stage at Campath-1H therapy (low/intermediate vs. high), ANC, and ALC; although, there was a trend towards significance for prior rituximab therapy (P = 0.07).

However, autologous immune responses are less evident. We have developed a method using sequential modulation of growth factors (SMGF) to generate specific anti-AML T-cells from primary cultures of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from patients with AML. This culture method induces greater degrees of antigen presentation by inducing dendritic cell (DC) differentiation of AML in the presence of autologous lymphocytes, which are then expanded by interleukin (IL)-2 and costimulatory molecule ligation. MNCs consisting of 92.3% +/- 5.1% AML blasts and 3.4% +/- 3.2% CD3+ T-cells were obtained from AML patients (n = 12) and cultured in AIM-V medium with IL-4 and recombinant granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Recombinant IL-2 was added on day 8. On day 21, culture conditions were changed to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies and IL-2. By day 42, 354 +/- 182-fold CD3+ T-cell expansion had occurred. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assays demonstrated that these T-cells caused significant lysis of autologous leukemia cells and AML cell lines, but not of cells of other lineages, in an HLA class I-dependent manner. Specific Vbeta subgroups (Vbeta3, -7, and -12a), possibly representing T-cell clones specific to AML-specific antigens, were expanded in the cultures of cells from 3 AML patients. SMGF can be used to induce and expand autologous T-cells with HLA class I-dependent antileukemia potential from the peripheral blood of AML patients. Adoptive transfer of these expanded T-cells to patients is a possible therapeutic approach for further study.","['Zhong, Rui-Kun', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Chen, Jian', 'Law, Ping', 'Yu, Ji-Feng', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Zhong RK', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Chen J', 'Law P', 'Yu JF', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 93093-0906, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/19 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/11/19 04:00'],"['2002/11/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500045 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12434951 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(10):557-68. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12434951.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,['5 R01 CA31888-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, for each child we identified the non-constitutive chromosomal sequences made up by the t(12;21) fusion gene.

Diagnosis and therapeutic strategies].,666-76,"BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cellular dysfunction and an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One of the hallmarks of MDS is their prognostic heterogeneity which complicates therapeutic decisions. Therapeutic decisions are further hampered by the advanced age of most patients and the problem of attendant comorbidities. With the exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, no treatment modality has been proven to be of benefit over supportive care. The purpose of this review is to summarize the diagnostic work-up as well as current approaches to the treatment of MDS. DIAGNOSIS AND RISK STRATIFICATION: The diagnosis of MDS is based on routine laboratory and peripheral blood evaluation. Bone marrow examination along with cytogenetic analyses are required for confirming und classifying MDS according to FAB or WHO proposals as well as performing a risk analysis according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) which distinguishes four risk groups with different life expectancies and AML incidences. THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES: Supportive treatment remains the mainstay of therapy, but does not alter the natural course of MDS. The only curative treatment of MDS is allogeneic stem cell transplantation which can be performed in high-risk patients up to an age of 60 years. The disease-free survival varies between 29% and 40% at 6-7 years after transplant. Unfavorable prognostic factors of survival in allogeneic stem cell transplantation are older age, advanced MDS stage, high-risk cytogenetics, high IPSS score and marrow fibrosis. For patients with high-risk MDS younger than 40 years, a matched unrelated donor transplant should be considered. AML-type chemotherapy is increasingly used in younger patients with high-risk MDS and yields complete remission rates between 45% and 79%. Despite high relapse rates, combination chemotherapy offers a chance of long-term remission for selected patients. For patients without HLA-matched allogeneic sibling donor, autologous stem cell transplantation may be used as consolidation therapy after successful conventional induction chemotherapy. For older patients with high-risk MDS in whom aggressive chemotherapy is contraindicated, intravenous treatment with 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) or oral treatment with low-dose melphalan are promising new treatment options which yielded overall response rates of 40-63%. Based on new insights into the pathobiology of MDS, additional treatment approaches have been developed in recent years including differentiation therapy with hematopoietic growth factors and retinoids, immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin or cyclosporine, cytokine inhibition by amifostine, pentoxifylline or soluble TNF-alpha receptor as well as angiogenesis inhibition by thalidomide. CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of the natural course and pathophysiology of MDS has resulted in several new treatment approaches which must be further evaluated in appropriate clinical trials. In Germany, such trials are performed and coordinated by the German MDS Study Group which is part of the program ""Kompetenznetzwerk Akute und Chronische Laukemien"".","['Aul, Carlo', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Aul C', 'Giagounidis A', 'Germing U', 'Ganser A']","['Medizinische Klinik II, St. Johannes-Hospital Duisburg, Germany. info@krebs-duisburg.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-002-1210-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2002 Nov 15;97(11):666-76. doi: 10.1007/s00063-002-1210-4.,49,Myelodysplastische Syndrome Aktueller Stand der Diagnostik und Therapie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These biomarkers include lysosomal stability, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-ferrihemoprotein reductase activity, liposfuscin deposition, and accumulation of lysosomal and cytoplasmic unsaturated neutral lipid. Normal variations in physiological processes (influenced by exogenous seasonal changes in temperature, salinity, food availability, etc.) may alter the sensitivity of these biomarkers to contaminant exposure. To address this issue, M. edulis (complex) were sampled monthly from a reference nonurban site (Coupeville, Penn Cove) and a polluted urban site (Seacrest, Elliott Bay) in Puget Sound, WA, for a period of 15 months. Physiological measurements including total length, total weight, somatic and mantle weights (an indication of gonadal development and reproductive status), condition index, and the presence or absence of hemic neoplasia (HN, or leukemia) were recorded. Significant differences in lysosomal stability, lysosomal and cytoplasmic unsaturated neutral lipids, lipofuscin deposition, and NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase activity in cells of the digestive gland or digestive tubules were generally found in mussels taken throughout the year from Seacrest compared to mussels sampled from Coupeville, consistent with exposure to chemical contaminants. No seasonally influenced suppression of the entire suite of parameters as measures of contaminant exposure was evident. Therefore these biomarkers can be used to evaluate contaminant exposure in mussels throughout the entire year.","['Kagley, A N', 'Snider, R G', 'Krishnakumar, P K', 'Casillas, E']","['Kagley AN', 'Snider RG', 'Krishnakumar PK', 'Casillas E']","['Environmental Conservation Division, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Hatfield Marine Science Center, Newport, Oregon 97391, USA. anna.kagley@noaa.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,0357245,IM,"['*Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Bivalvia/*physiology', 'Body Weight', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase/analysis/pharmacology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipofuscin/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Reproduction', 'Seasons', 'Water Pollutants/*adverse effects']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00244-002-1303-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Environ Contam Toxicol. 2003 Jan;44(1):43-52. doi: 10.1007/s00244-002-1303-3.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipofuscin)', '0 (Water Pollutants)', 'EC 1.18.1.2 (Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CBFbeta forms a heterodimer with RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1), which has a DNA binding domain homologous to the pair-rule protein runt in Drosophila melanogaster. Both RUNX1 and CBFbeta are essential for hematopoiesis. Haploinsufficiency of another runt-related protein, RUNX2 (also called CBFA1), causes cleidocranial dysplasia in humans and is essential in skeletal development by regulating osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. Mice deficient in Cbfb (Cbfb(-/-)) die at midgestation, so the function of Cbfbeta in skeletal development has yet to be ascertained. To investigate this issue, we rescued hematopoiesis of Cbfb(-/-) mice by introducing Cbfb using the Gata1 promoter. The rescued Cbfb(-/-) mice recapitulated fetal liver hematopoiesis in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and survived until birth, but showed severely delayed bone formation. Although mesenchymal cells differentiated into immature osteoblasts, intramembranous bones were poorly formed. The maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells was markedly delayed, and no endochondral bones were formed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays showed that Cbfbeta was necessary for the efficient DNA binding of Runx2 and for Runx2-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings indicate that Cbfbeta is required for the function of Runx2 in skeletal development.","['Yoshida, Carolina A', 'Furuichi, Tatsuya', 'Fujita, Takashi', 'Fukuyama, Ryo', 'Kanatani, Naoko', 'Kobayashi, Shinji', 'Satake, Masanobu', 'Takada, Kenji', 'Komori, Toshihisa']","['Yoshida CA', 'Furuichi T', 'Fujita T', 'Fukuyama R', 'Kanatani N', 'Kobayashi S', 'Satake M', 'Takada K', 'Komori T']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, 2-2 Yamada-oka Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/physiology', '*Osteogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Skull/cytology', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng1015 [doi]', 'ng1015 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2002 Dec;32(4):633-8. doi: 10.1038/ng1015.

A cohort of 37,220 Iowa women ages 55 to 69 years in 1986 with no history of prior cancer was linked annually to a population-based cancer registry. Through 1998 (13 years of follow-up), 258 incident cases of NHL were identified, including 135 cases of diffuse NHL, 58 cases of follicular NHL, and 31 cases of small lymphocytic NHL. In addition, 63 cases of CLL were identified. Current and former use of HRT (primarily estrogen) and other cancer risk factors were self-reported on the baseline (1986) questionnaire. Compared with never users of HRT at study baseline, current [multivariate relative risk (RR), 1.4; 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 0.9-2.0) but not former (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4) users were at increased risk of NHL after adjustment for age and other confounding factors. This association was seen only in nodal NHL [RR(current), 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.4); RR(former), 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.6)] and was not apparent for extra-nodal sites. Of the common subtypes, there was a strong positive association with follicular NHL [RR(current), 3.3 (95% CI, 1.6-6.9); RR(former), 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4-4.7)], and women who were current users for more than 5 years had the highest risk (RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.6). There was no association with diffuse or small lymphocytic NHL, or with CLL. Most of the follicular NHLs were nodal (88%), and exclusion of extra-nodal sites slightly strengthened the association with HRT. For diffuse NHL, 64% of the cases were nodal, and there was no association of HRT with either nodal or extra-nodal sites. These data suggest that HRT is a risk factor for follicular NHL but not for diffuse or small lymphocyte NHL or CLL.","['Cerhan, James R', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Ansell, Steven M', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Kurtin, Paul J', 'Janney, Carol A', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Potter, John D', 'Sellers, Thomas A', 'Folsom, Aaron R']","['Cerhan JR', 'Vachon CM', 'Habermann TM', 'Ansell SM', 'Witzig TE', 'Kurtin PJ', 'Janney CA', 'Zheng W', 'Potter JD', 'Sellers TA', 'Folsom AR']","['Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. cerhan.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Estrogens/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', ""Women's Health""]",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2002 Nov;11(11):1466-71.,,,['0 (Estrogens)'],,,"['K07 CA64220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA39741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It increases transplantation-related mortality (TRM) but reduces risk of relapse. The net effect of these 2 discordant effects determines survival. In view of current interests to exploit graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, we analyzed 4174 HLA-identical sibling transplantations for chronic myeloid leukemia in first chronic phase, depending on the presence or absence and severity of GvHD with a landmark analysis. During the first 100 days, only aGvHD grades III and IV had an impact on TRM. During the time period day 100 to 3 years increasing severity of aGvHD is associated with increased TRM and decreased relapse incidence (RI) with hazard ratios (HRs) for TRM as follows: grade 0, HR = 1.0; grade I, HR = 1.52 (1.19-1.96); grade II, HR = 2.48 (1.95-3.14); grade III, HR = 5.76 (4.44-7.48); grade IV, HR = 14.7 (10.9-19.9) and likewise for RI: grade I versus 0, HR = 0.94 (0.76-1.16); grade II, HR = 0.60 (0.46-0.77); grade III, HR = 0.48 (0.29-0.81); grade IV, HR = 0.14 (0.02-0.99). Beyond 3 years, TRM and RI are determined by cGvHD. Limited cGvHD reduces RI to the same extent as extensive cGvHD but has no impact on TRM and, hence, results in best survival with an HR = 0.48 (0.32-0.71). aGvHD grade I has the highest likelihood of subsequent limited cGvHD, which results in cumulative incidence estimates of survival at 10 years being best for patients with initial aGvHD grade I: survival at 10 years grade 0 = 59%, I = 63%, II = 56%, III = 26%, IV = not applicable.

ALL cells are thought to be sensitive to L-Asp due to lower asparagine synthetase (AS) levels. Resistance to L-Asp may be caused by an elevated cellular level of AS or by the ability of resistant cells to rapidly induce the expression of the AS gene on L-Asp exposure. AS may be a target regulated by t(12;21). We studied the relationship between t(12;21) and the mRNA level of AS to investigate a possible mechanism underlying L-Asp sensitivity. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis surprisingly revealed that 30 patients positive for t(12;21) expressed 5-fold more AS mRNA compared with 17 patients negative for t(12;21) (P =.008) and 11 samples from healthy controls (P =.016). The mRNA levels of AS between t(12;21)(-) ALL and healthy controls did not differ. No difference was found between ALL patients positive or negative for t(12;21) in the capacity to up-regulate AS after in vitro L-Asp exposure, excluding a defective capacity for t(12;21) cells in up-regulating AS on L-Asp exposure. Moreover, no correlation was observed between AS mRNA expression and sensitivity to L-Asp. We conclude that the sensitivity of t(12;21)(+) childhood ALL to L-Asp is not associated with the expression level of the AS gene. Furthermore, we contradict the general thought that leukemic cells specifically lack AS compared with normal bone marrow and blood cells.","['Stams, Wendy A G', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Stigter, Rolinda L', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Slater, Rosalyn', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stams WA', 'den Boer ML', 'Beverloo HB', 'Meijerink JP', 'Stigter RL', 'van Wering ER', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Slater R', 'Pieters R']","[""Erasmus MC/University Medical Center Rotterdam/Sophia Children's Hospital, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. stams@kgk.fgg.eur.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2446 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51165-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2743-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2446.

It has been shown to play an important role in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Because immune responses of allogeneic BM donors may affect acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we investigated the effect of pretreating BM transplant donors with IL-18 on the severity of acute GVHD using a well-characterized experimental BMT model (BALB/c-->B6). Pretreatment of allogeneic BM transplant donors with IL-18 significantly improved survival (80% vs 0%; P <.001), and reduced clinical, biochemical, and pathologic indices of acute GVHD in BM transplant recipients. IL-18 pretreatment was associated with reduced interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and greater IL-4 secretion by donor T cells after BMT. Acute GVHD mortality was reduced when IL-18 was administered to donors deficient in IFN-gamma and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) but not STAT6 signaling molecules, suggesting a critical role for STAT6 signaling in IL-18's protective effect. IL-18 treatment did not alter donor CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity and preserved graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects after allogeneic BMT (70% vs 10%; P <.01). Together these data illustrate that pretreatment of donors with IL-18 prior to allogeneic BMT attenuates acute GVHD in a STAT6-dependent mechanism while preserving GVL effects.","['Reddy, Pavan', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard', 'Williams, Debra L', 'Liu, Chen', 'Cooke, Kenneth R', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Reddy P', 'Teshima T', 'Hildebrandt G', 'Williams DL', 'Liu C', 'Cooke KR', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0942, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tissue Donors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology/methods']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2566 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51184-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2877-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2566.

Our previous study defined a functional role of CD40 activation in MM cell homing and migration. In this study, we examine signaling events mediating CD40-induced MM cell migration. We show that cross-linking CD40, using either soluble CD40L (sCD40L) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb), induces phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and activates its downstream effector AKT in MM.1S cells. CD40 activation also activates the MAP kinase (MEK) pathway, evidenced by phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK), but not c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K and MEK, as well as adenoviruses expressing dominant-negative and constitutively expressed AKT, we demonstrate that PI3K and AKT activities are required for CD40-induced MM cell migration. In contrast, inhibition of ERK/MEK phosphorylation only partially (10%-15%) prevents migration, suggesting only a minor role in regulation of CD40-mediated MM migration. We further demonstrate that CD40 induces nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation as a downstream target of PI3K/AKT signaling, and that inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling using specific inhibitors PS1145 and SN50 completely abrogates CD40-induced MM migration. Finally, we demonstrate that urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), an NF-kappa B target gene, is induced by CD40; and conversely, that uPA induction via CD40 is blocked by PI3K and NF-kappa B inhibitors. Our data therefore indicate that CD40-induced MM cell migration is primarily mediated via activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-kappa B signaling, and further suggest that novel therapies targeting this pathway may inhibit MM cell migration associated with progressive MM.","['Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Podar, Klaus', 'Mitsiades, Nicholas', 'Lin, Boris', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Gupta, Deepak', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Catley, Laurence', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Munshi, Nikhil C', 'Treon, Steven P', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Tai YT', 'Podar K', 'Mitsiades N', 'Lin B', 'Mitsiades C', 'Gupta D', 'Akiyama M', 'Catley L', 'Hideshima T', 'Munshi NC', 'Treon SP', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['CD40 Antigens/metabolism/*physiology', '*Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2813 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51168-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2762-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2813.

Based on conductance, IR and electronic spectral evidence, a square-planar structure is assigned to these complexes. The crystal and molecular structure of the [Pd(asme)(2)] complex (asme=anionic form of the acetone Schiff base of S-methyldithiocarbazate) has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The complex has a distorted cis-square planar structure with the ligands coordinated to the palladium(II) ions as uninegatively charged bidentate NS chelating agents via the azomethine nitrogen and the mercaptide sulfur atoms. The distortion from a regular square-planar geometry is attributed to the restricted bite angles of the ligands. Antimicrobial tests indicate that the Schiff bases exhibit strong activities against the pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus subtilis (mutant defective DNA repair), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis (wild type) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungi, Candida albicans (CA), Candida lypotica (2075), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20341) and Aspergillus ochraceous (398)-the activities exhibited by these compounds being greater than that of the standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, streptomycin and nystatin, respectively. The palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes are inactive against most of these organisms but, the microbe, Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows strong sensitivity to the platinum(II) complexes. Screening of the compounds for their cytotoxicities against T-lymphoblastic leukemia cancer cells has shown that the acetone Schiff base of S-methyldithiocarbazate (Hasme) exhibits a very weak activity, whereas the S-benzyl derivative (Hasbz) is inactive. However, the palladium(II) complexes exhibit strong cytotoxicities against this cancer; their activities being more than that of the standard anticancer drug, tamoxifen.

Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a T cell growth factor involved in the late immune reconstitution, but its function during the early period of cytopenia has not been investigated. In the present study, we found that patients with untreated AML had decreased IL-7 serum levels, and induction chemotherapy had divergent effects on these levels. In contrast, patients in complete remission (CR) had intermediate levels immediately before consolidation therapy, and these levels decreased significantly when the patients developed therapy-induced cytopenia. Systemic IL-7 levels showed only minor increases during febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, IL-7 enhanced in vitro proliferative responses of polyclonal T cells derived from cytopenic patients, and the majority of circulating clonogenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from cytopenic patients could respond to both IL-2 and IL-7. To conclude, patients with untreated AML and severe chemotherapy-induced leukopenia (1) differ from other patients with CD4(+) T lymphopenia in that they show decreased IL-7 serum levels, and (2) the detection of circulating IL7-responsive T cells indicates that variations in systemic IL-7 levels are functionally important and contribute to an additional qualitative T cell defect in these severely T lymphopenic patients.","['Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Glenjen, Nils', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Wendelbo O', 'Glenjen N', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. wend@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107999002760624297 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002 Oct;22(10):1057-65. doi: 10.1089/107999002760624297.,,,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mepacrine (10 microM), oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (10 microM) and bromoenol lactone (10 microM) did not affect both the level of histamine release and ROS generation induced by HCl.

Propranolol (200 microM), a phospholipase D (PLD) inhibitor, and neomycin (1 mM), a nonspecific PLC and PLD inhibitor, significantly inhibited both histamine release and ROS generation. Diphenyleneiodonium (10 microM), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and tiron (5 mM), an intracellular ROS scavenger significantly inhibited the HCl-induced histamine release and ROS generation.

METHODS: The Swedish Cancer Register III contains nationwide data on cancer incidence between 1971 and 1989, by occupation and industry of employment, as reported in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. Dry cleaners, launderers, and pressers were compared with the remaining part of the employed population using multivariable Poisson regression models and standardized incidence ratios. RESULTS: Dry cleaners, launderers, and pressers employed in the laundry, ironing, or dyeing industry in both censuses showed an increased risk of Hodgkin's disease [relative risk (RR) 2.69,95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01-7.19], an elevated risk of leukemia among women (RR 2.53,95% CI 1.44-4.46), and increased risks of stomach (RR 1.80,95% CI 1.05-3.11) and laryngeal (RR 2.42, 95% CI 0.91-6.45) cancers among men. The results of the analyses of launderers and dry cleaners as a separate occupational group reflected those of the whole exposure group, while pressers showed an elevated lung cancer risk (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.75-3.72). CONCLUSIONS: If they are not due to chance or confounding, the results of this study reflect either the potentiation of other carcinogens by solvents or direct effects. The results are limited by the use of job and industry titles as proxies for occupational exposures.","['Travier, Noomie', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Plato, Nils', 'Moradi, Tahereh', 'Boffetta, Paolo']","['Travier N', 'Gridley G', 'De Roos AJ', 'Plato N', 'Moradi T', 'Boffetta P']","['Unit of Environmental Cancer Epidemiology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,"['Adult', 'Coloring Agents/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Laundering', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupations', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2002/11/16 04:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2002/11/16 04:00'],"['2002/11/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['684 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.684 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2002 Oct;28(5):341-8. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.684.,,,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Solvents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, phosphorylation at either site has been correlated with decreased binding to the inhibitory partner Mdm-2 and enhanced transactivation of p53 target genes. In this study, we investigated the impact of Asp substitution at Thrl8 and Ser20 (p53Tl8D/S20D) on the functional regulation of p53. Asp substitution is commonly accepted as a means of mimicking phosphorylation due to the introduction of negative charge within the functional group. p53T18D/S20D was refractory to in vitro digestion by calpain, a protease recognizing a-helical structure within the transactivation domain. In addition, transfected p53T18D/S20D poorly bound GST-Mdm-2 in vitro, enhanced the endogenous expression of the p53 transactivation targets p21(Waf1/Cip1) and fas/APO-1, and significantly curtailed cell proliferation relative to wild-type p53 transfected cells. Thus, Asp substitution at Thr18 and Ser20 within the a-helical segment of the transactivation domain reduced Mdm-2 interaction, upregulating transactivation of cell-cycle and apoptotic regulatory targets, curtailing cellular proliferation.","['Jabbur, James R', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Jabbur JR', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Pathology, Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, The University of Texas M.

BCR-ABL is generated as a result of a reciprocal t(9;22) chromosomal translocation. The mechanisms responsible for this illegitimate recombination event remain elusive but are presumed to require a close spatial association of the translocation partners (chromosomes 9 and 22). BCR-ABL fusion transcripts can be detected by a sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the leucocytes of some healthy individuals suggesting that chromosomal translocations may occur frequently in the general population. The presence of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts does not imply that the individual will inevitably develop CML since other conditions must be favourable for expansion of the abnormal clone. Breakpoints in the ABL gene occur within a 5' segment. BCR-ABL fusion transcripts lack ABL exon a1 and consist of BCR exons fused directly to ABL exon a2. The breakpoints in the BCR gene on chromosome 22 are found within three defined regions. Depending on the position of the BCR breakpoint, fusion genes are generated that encode 190-, 210- or 230-kD forms of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Since the ABL component of the fusion gene is largely invariant, it follows that variability in disease phenotype may be due to protein sequences encoded by the translocation partner, BCR. Different disease phenotypes are associated with each of the three Bcr-Abl oncoproteins, p190(Bcr-Abl), p210(Bcr-Abl )and p230(Bcr-Abl). Mechanisms associated with malignant transformation include altered cellular adhesion, activation of mitogenic signalling pathways, inhibition of apoptosis and proteasomal degradation of physiologically important cellular proteins. CML is subject to an inexorable progression from an 'indolent' chronic phase to a terminal blast crisis. Disease progression is presumed to be associated with the phenomenon of genomic instability.","['Barnes, David J', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Barnes DJ', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College of Science, Technology & Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['65655 [pii]', '10.1159/000065655 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2002;108(4):180-202. doi: 10.1159/000065655.,184,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']","['Copyright 2002 S.

Although much has been published about these two disorders, their aetiology is by no means fully established. It would appear, however, that in this paediatric subset of MPDs a stage/developmentally specific vulnerability for proliferation and transformation exists.

The main neuroimaging features in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy were retrospectively reviewed. To simplify the approach and facilitate differential diagnosis, the neuroimaging features have been classified into three main categories: central nervous system manifestations of primary disease, side effects of therapeutic procedures (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation), and complications due to immunosuppression, particularly infections. Manifestations of primary disease include cerebrovascular complications (hemorrhage, cerebral infarction) and central nervous system involvement (infiltration of the meninges, parenchyma, bone marrow, orbit, and spine). Effects of radiation therapy include white matter disease, mineralizing microangiopathy, parenchymal brain volume loss, radiation-induced cryptic vascular malformations, and second neoplasms. Effects of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation include hemorrhage, dural venous thrombosis, white matter disease, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and anterior lumbosacral radiculopathy. Both the underlying malignancy and antineoplastic therapy can cause immunosuppression. Fungi are the most frequent causal microorganisms in immunosuppressed patients with infection.

METHODS: In the setting of renal cell carcinoma, some patients' tumors will grow slowly naturally. An appropriate design has to distinguish antiproliferative activity attributable to the novel agent from indolent disease. We propose a randomized discontinuation design that initially treats all patients with the study agent (stage 1) and then randomizes in a double-blind fashion to continuing therapy or placebo only those patients whose disease is stable (stage 2). This design allows the investigators to determine if apparent slow tumor growth is attributable to the drug or to selection of patients with naturally slow-growing tumors. RESULTS: By selecting a more homogeneous population, the randomized portion of the study requires fewer patients than would a study randomizing all patients at entry. The design also avoids potential confounding because of heterogeneous tumor growth. Because the two randomly assigned treatment groups each comprise patients with apparently slow growing tumors, any difference between the groups in disease progression after randomization is more likely a result of the study drug and less likely a result of imbalance with respect to tumor growth rates.

In this study, we have found that amino acid residues 140-147 (RKRRQTSM) at the C-terminal end of p21(Cip1/WAF1), a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, constitute an ideal phosphorylation consensus sequence for Pim-1. We demonstrate that Pim-1 efficiently phosphorylates this peptide sequence as well as the p21 protein in vitro. We also demonstrate by pull-down assay and by immunoprecipitation that Pim-1 associates with p21. During phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U937 cells, both Pim-1 and p21 expression levels increase with Pim-1 levels increasing in both the nucleus and cytoplasm while p21 remains primarily cytoplasmic. Co-transfection of wild type p21 with wild type Pim-1 results in cytoplasmic localization of p21 while co-transfection of wild type p21 with kinase dead Pim-1 results in nuclear localization of p21. Consistent with the results from the phosphoamino acid assay, Pim-1 phosphorylates transfected p21 only on Thr(145) in p21-deficient human fibroblasts and this phosphorylation event results in the cytoplasmic localization of p21. These findings demonstrate that Pim-1 associates with and phosphorylates p21 in vivo, which influences the subcellular localization of p21.","['Wang, Zeping', 'Bhattacharya, Nandini', 'Mixter, Philip F', 'Wei, Wenyi', 'Sedivy, John', 'Magnuson, Nancy S']","['Wang Z', 'Bhattacharya N', 'Mixter PF', 'Wei W', 'Sedivy J', 'Magnuson NS']","['School of Molecular Biosciences and the Cancer Prevention and Research Center, Washington State University, PO Box 644234, Pullman, WA 99164-4234, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'Substrate Specificity']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488902003476 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00347-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Dec 16;1593(1):45-55. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00347-6.,,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,"['R01 AG16694/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, functions of c-Fos in the process of differentiation towards macrophages are still controversial. To explore the functions, we used the murine myeloblastic leukemia cell line M1. Stimulation of M1 cells with bacterial LPS promotes their terminal differentiation into functional macrophages. Overexpression of c-fos in M1 cells dramatically increased sensitivity of the cells for LPS-induced differentiation and generation of morphologically differentiated cells. However, the overexpression did not modulate phagocytotic functions, surface expression of macrophage markers such as CD16/CD32 (Fcgamma Receptor) and CD54 (ICAM-1), and expression of lysozyme, esterase and c-fms mRNA. Surprisingly, induction of the MHC class II expression on M1 cells after stimulation was inhibited by the overexpression. Expression of CIITA, as an essential transcription factor for the expression, was also reduced in the M1 cells.

ATRA induced apoptosis in all the B-CLL samples tested, and this was accompanied by a specific reduction in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein expression in the apoptotic cells. In contrast, Bax, p21, and p53 expression was not altered in either the viable or apoptotic B-CLL cells, inferring that ATRA utilises a p53-independent cell death pathway. Caspase-3 activation was shown to be a prerequisite for ATRA-induced apoptosis, which was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK. In addition, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist AGN194310 failed to abrogate the apoptotic effects of ATRA, indicating that RAR binding was not necessary for ATRA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, there was no evidence of ATRA-induced differentiation of the B-CLL cells in this study either in terms of altered morphology or immunophenotype. In summary these data indicate that ATRA induces apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and this is independent of RAR binding, p53 activation, and cellular differentiation in B-CLL cells.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Ali, Khalida', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Chowdary, Pratima', 'Kell, Jonathan', 'Bentley, Paul']","['Pepper C', 'Ali K', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Fegan C', 'Chowdary P', 'Kell J', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan CF64 2XX, Wales, UK. chrisp@llanhaem.demon.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/11/15 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['2o799 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02799.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Oct;69(4):227-35. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02799.x.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to describe the disease characteristics and treatment results from a series of 22 elderly AML patients undergoing ASCT. METHODS: The median age was 64 yr (range 61-71). Twenty patients were in first complete remission (CR1), two in CR2, and all were in performance status 0-1. The median interval between CR achievement and ACST was 3 months (range 2-5). In 20 cases peripheral blood stem cells were infused, in two bone marrow. RESULTS: All patients had a successful engrafment. One patient (5%) died from transplant-related complications. The median number of days to granulocytes > 500 mm-3 and platelets > 20 000 mm-3 was 11(range 9-15) and 13 (range 9-20), respectively. Non-hematologic toxicity included WHO grade III-IV stomatitis in 32% patients and grade IV nausea and vomiting in one (4.5%). Seven patients had fever of unknown origin, while in 14 a documented infection was diagnosed. Median duration of hospitalization was 31 d (range 16-60). CONCLUSIONS: After a median follow-up of 12 months from ASCT, nine patients are alive in continuous CR and 13 died from AML relapse. Median survival from diagnosis and disease-free survival (DFS) was 19 and 14 months, respectively. Our data show that ASCT with a standard conditioning regimen is feasible in AML patients aged more than 60 yr. Toxicity and hemopoietic recovery do not substantially differ from those observed in young adults. DFS and overall survival (OS) duration are encouraging, but a longer follow up is needed on a larger series of patients.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Carellajr, Angelo Michele', 'Cantore, Nicola', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Tamburini, Anna', 'Palmieri, Salvatore', 'Mele, Giuseppina', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Greco, Michele Mario', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Ferrara F', 'Venditti A', 'Carellajr AM', 'Cantore N', 'Buccisano F', 'Tamburini A', 'Palmieri S', 'Mele G', 'Annunziata M', 'Greco MM', 'Amadori S']","['Divisione di Ematologia, A.O.R.N.

Furthermore, since there is no risk for either the mother or baby, few people refuse to donate. There is thought to be a low risk for virus contamination and also probably a low incidence and severity of GVHD. Cord blood can be obtained quickly without the assistance of a coordinator and one or 2 locus-mismatched HLA is usually acceptable. In Japan, there are 10 cord blood banks supported by the government. Between 1996 and June 2002, 9,500 units were registered with the Japan cord blood bank network (JCBBN). 630 units were delivered and most of these were transplanted. The status of registered cord blood units worldwide is shown. 59,081 units have been registered by NETCORD. The Japan cord blood bank network accounts for 13% of these units. I will discuss the Tokyo cord blood tank (TCBB). The bank at Tokyo, to which we belong, is one of the largest banks in Japan. We helped to establish Asia CORD in 2000 and have held annual conferences and meetings in Tokyo to exchange information. So far, China, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Viet Nam and Japan have participated. We accepted three trainees from the Ho Chi Minh City Blood Transfusion and Hematology Center for training in cord blood transplantation in May 2001.

In ATL-endemic areas, the rate of HTLV-I carriers is high. Both HTLV-I and ATL have been shown to be endemic in some regions of the world, especially in southwest Japan, the Caribbean islands, South Americas, and parts of Central Africa. Antibodies against HTLV-I have been found in over one million individuals, and more than 700 cases of ATL have been diagnosed each year in Japan alone. The cumulative incidence of ATL among HTLV-I carriers in Japan is estimated at 2.5% (3-5% in males, 1-2% in females). In endemic areas, HTLV-I Ab were found in the sera of 6 to 37 percent of healthy adults over 40 years of age. This clustering is thought to be due to the limited transmission of virus between socially isolated populations. The diagnostic criteria for HTLV-I associated ATL have been defined as follows. 1) Histologically and/or cytologically proven lymphoid malignancy with T cell antigens. 2) Abnormal T-lymphocytes present in the peripheral blood, except in the lymphoma type. 3) Serum specimens for all patients with ATL have HTLV-I Ab. 4) Demonstration of clonality of HTLV-I proviral DNA is a definite diagnosis of ATL. ATL shows diverse clinical features but can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smoldering, and lymphoma type. The pattern of HTLV-I transmission is through one of three different modes. Infected mothers can transmit the virus to newborns mainly via breast milk. The virus also can be transmitted from male to female by sexual intercourse, and through blood transfusion. Chemotherapy is not effective; the acute and lymphoma types have a poor prognosis. ATL is generally treated with curative intent using combination chemotherapy, although long-term success has been very limited. Unfortunately that advance did not translate into an improvement in the overall survival; the median remain 10 months. In contrast, smoldering ATL, or some cases of chronic ATL, may have a more protracted natural course, which may be compromised by aggressive chemotherapy. Alternative strategies for both acute and chronic forms are clearly needed. After infection of HTLV-I, there is a long latent period before onset of ATL. Analyses by PCR showed that clearly proliferation occurred in intermediate state or even carriers with high virus load. Such clonal proliferation might be preleukemic stage, which suggested that carriers with high virus load should be risk group to have ATL.","['Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Yamaguchi K', 'Watanabe T']","['Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/virology']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165123 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 2:240-5. doi: 10.1007/BF03165123.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The real-time PCR method is fast and associated with a high reproducibility rate. It is used more often for monitoring MRD and chimerism in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). There are real-time PCR methods for patients with CML, AML and ALL patients with inv(16), t(8;21), t(15;17); t(1;19) and other chromosomal aberrations. For patients with AML monitoring MRD is useful to identify patients who were at high risk for relapse after receiving chemotherapy. In patients with CML monitoring MRD might be helpful to assess success of after allogeneic SCT, or response to therapies with interferon alfa or STI 571. We found, that it is possible to estimate the relapse stage in CML after SCT by the amount of bcr-abl fusion transcript detected using a real-time PCR method. The median measured bcr-abl amount differ significantly (P<0.001) between the various stages, which has relevant clinical implications because it enables early therapeutic decisions in relapsing patients after transplant as e.g. the application of DLI to induce graft-versus-leukemia effects. Using real-time PCR it is possible to detect differences at alleles between recipient and donor at a single nucleotide basis (SNP) for chimerism analysis. The real-time PCR method enables to achieve a high a sensitivity of up to 1x10(-4), which is much more sensitive than all other chimerism methods including VNTR-PCR, STR-PCR. Furthermore, chimerism in male recipients with a female donor can be monitored also by detecting y-chromosome specific sequences by real-time PCR after transplant, which might be the most sensitive method to detect host type gene sequences. All in all, new real-time PCR methods offer a fast, reliable and very sensitive method to evaluate MRD and chimerism in patients after allogeneic SCT and therefore, to help to identify patients who are at high risk for leukemic relapse.","['Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']",['Elmaagacli AH'],"['Department of Bone marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165118 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 2:204-5. doi: 10.1007/BF03165118.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases are characterized by clonal expansion of the myeloid compartment, increased marrow angiogenesis, and varying risks for blastic transformation. A clear molecular abnormality exists (t(9;22) leading to the fusion of BCR-Abl) only for CML, which led to effective targeted therapy (STI-571). Since no similar pathogenetic mechanism has been discovered for the t(9;22) negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders, their respective diagnosis is currently based on a variety of rather cumbersome diagnostic criteria. Polycythemia vera is distinguished from reactive erythrocytosis through erythropoietin independent growth of erythroid progenitors in vitro, suppressed levels of endogenous erythropoietin, possible overexpression of PRV-1 (polycythemia rubra vera-1), decreased c-Mpl expression on megakaryocytes, as well as overexpression of bcl-xL, and potentially aberrant activity of the Jak-Stat pathway. ET is defined by thrombocytosis and is distinguished from reactive states by decreased megakaryocyte c-Mpl expression, and a propensity for thrombosis. AMM has been associated with a variety of observations including increased concentrations of pro-fibrotic cytokines, increased angiogenesis, and myeloid expansion. AMM is often indistinguishable clinically and prognostically from the advanced phases of other CMPD (specifically post-polycythemic and post-thrombocythemia myeloid metaplasia), all of which are subentities of a diagnosis of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). The management of CMPD patients is quite varied given the broad range of disease severity and survival observed. The role of stem cell transplantation is limited by the age and comorbidities encountered in CMPD patients. Since no broadly applicable therapy effects the mortality of the CMPD, management currently focuses on the prevention/palliation of disease morbidity (i.e. vascular complications, pruritus, organomegaly, constitutional symptoms). Palliative strategies which currently focus on non-specific myelosuppresion, will hopefully be soon replaced by targeted therapies as insight into pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases evolves.","['Mesa, Ruben A']",['Mesa RA'],"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Management', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165117 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 2:193-203. doi: 10.1007/BF03165117.,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little doubt that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can eradicate the leukaemia and that a 'graft-versus-leukaemia' effect makes a major contribution to this result; conversely only a minority of patients are eligible for transplant, which still carries an appreciable risk of mortality or protracted morbidity. For the majority of patients interferon-alpha prolongs life to some degree in comparison with hydroxyurea but is associated with considerable toxicity. The newly introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib, Glivec) induces complete haematologic remission in almost all cases and is associated with a very high incidence of cytogenetic response; its capacity to prolong life in comparison with interferon-alpha is not yet established. Here we review some factors that predict survival after non-transplant therapy and after allografting for CML in chronic phase. We consider two contrasting options for managing the newly diagnosed patient and conclude that for the present allogeneic stem cell transplantation soon after diagnosis should continue to be offered as an option for selected patients.

INDUCTION: The fusion PML/RAR gene provided the rationale for using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as differentiation therapy. The standard approach is antracycline + ATRA and no ARA-C. CONSOLIDATION: Anthracycline based chemotherapy, no high dose ARA-C and perhaps no ARA-C. Maintenance seems to be important. Cure with ATRA + chemotherapy increased to 75% from 35% with chemotherapy alone. POOR PROGNOSIS FACTORS: WBC >10,000, age >55, platelets <40,000 and CD 56 expression. Achieving and maintaining a molecular remission (MCR) i.e. RT-PCR (-) for PML/RAR alpha expression, is the best predictor for cure. Conversion to PCR (+) will eventually result in relapse. PCR monitoring in the first 2 years and intervention during molecular relapse would be safer than treatment in clinical relapse. Molecular relapses have been treated successfully by ATRA plus BMT. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) or gentuzumab (mylotarg) are also being studied. RELAPSE (INDUCTION): Patients after ATRA in first CR are less likely to respond to ATRA reinduction regardless of the time off ATRA and rarely achieve a molecular remission. Single-agent ATO induced in 52 relapsed patients CR of 87% (75% MCR) with low toxicity and no treatment related deaths (U.S. pivotal trial), confirmed in a NCI trial. Induction of relapsing patients with single agent ATO is preferable than ATRA + chemotherapy because the high molecular remission and lower toxicity. RELAPSE (POST REMISSION): No standard approach and the role of chemotherapy is unknown. ATO alone: in the pivotal trial, 9/21 patients had long remissions without other therapy. BMT: Not indicated in 1st MCR. In young patients auto BMT with PCR (-) harvests could be done in subsequent CR. Allo BMT has a higher death rate without overall better results. In the pivotal trial 12 patients were transplanted in CR after ATO alone (9 allo BMT) and 11 still without disease. Possibly allo BMT is safer after a less toxic ATO induction.

The importance of the allogeneic response to a successful outcome is clearly illustrated by the results of stem cell transplant for malignancy after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Remarkably little is understood about the molecular nature of minor H antigens and this has impeded efforts to determine the role of specific disparities in graft versus tumor reactions or to manipulate T cell responses to augment antitumor activity without exacerbating GVHD. The isolation of minor H antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones from recipients of allogeneic HCT has provided the reagents to characterize their expression on leukemic progenitors and to identify the genes encoding these antigens. Using cDNA expression cloning, genetic polymorphisms in the human IFI-75, Uty, KIAA0020, and UGT2B17 genes have been identified to encode new minor H antigens presented by HLA A3, B8, A2, and A29 respectively. Two of these genes are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells including leukemic progenitors suggesting it may be possible to augment T cell responses to promote a selective graft versus leukemia effect. A third gene, UGT2B17 is highly expressed in liver and GI tract and may be a target for GVHD in these organs. The studies to identify the molecular nature of minor H antigens have provided insights into the complexities of the graft versus host response associated with allogeneic HCT, but the challenge for the future will be to develop strategies that can selectively induce durable graft versus tumor effects without GVHD. A critical issue in developing specific immunotherapy to augment GVL responses is to determine which minor H antigens are expressed on leukemic stem cells. Studies using transplantation of human AML into SCID mice have identified a putative leukemic stem cell which is contained in the CD34+ CD38- subset of the blast population and is present in very low frequency (<1/200,000) in blood or bone marrow from AML patents. We have examined the ability of minor H antigen-specific CTL to prevent engraftment of human AML in NOD/SCID mice. These studies show that engraftment of leukemias derived from individuals encoding the minor H antigen can be specifically prevented demonstrating that AML stem cells express minor H antigens and are targets for CTL. One approach to determine directly which minor H antigens can be selectively targeted to induce a GVL effect without GVHD is to adoptively transfer T cell clones of defined specificity and function to patients who relapse after HCT. Studies of this approach are now in progress in acute leukemia and have provided important insights into potential obstacles of T cell therapy for relapsed leukemia after HCT.","['Riddell, Stanley R', 'Murata, M', 'Bryant, S', 'Warren, E H']","['Riddell SR', 'Murata M', 'Bryant S', 'Warren EH']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165108 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 2:155-61. doi: 10.1007/BF03165108.,80,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes helps to further define molecular subclasses and cytogenetic risk categories for patients with these disorders. Moreover, FISH permits analysis of proliferating (metaphase cells) and non-proliferating (interphase nuclei) cells, and is useful in establishing the percentage of neoplastic cells before and after therapy (minimal residual disease). For patients with myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia, these chromosome techniques are important for accurate diagnosis and classification of disease and to help decide treatment and monitor response to therapy. Conventional cytogenetic studies have been problematic in chronic lymphocytic leukemia because the neoplastic cells divide infrequently. However, interphase FISH studies now permit detection of chromosome anomalies with prognostic significance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The World Health Organization recognizes that genetic anomalies are one of the most reliable criteria for classification of malignant lymphomas. New methods to extract individual nuclei from paraffin-embedded tissue are now available which permit the use of interphase FISH to detect important chromosome anomalies in lymphoma.","['Dewald, Gordon W']",['Dewald GW'],"['Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/genetics']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165090 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 2:65-74. doi: 10.1007/BF03165090.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with MF, either idiopathic or on the basis of pre-existing disorders, are also transplanted successfully with stem cells from related or unrelated donors. Transplants early in the disease, before leukemic transformation, are successful in 60 to approximately 80% of patients. Success rates are lower in patients who have developed MDS or leukemia. New conditioning regimens have permitted successful HSCT even in patients in the seventh decade of life. Results with a regimen using a combination of busulfan (targeted to predetermined plasma levels) and cyclophosphamide are particularly encouraging.

European Group for Blood Marrow Treansplantation.,386-92,"Disease or treatment oriented registries form an integral part of modern medicine. They complement industry driven, corporate group sponsored and institutional research and are, together with prospective randomised trials cornerstones of modern evidence based medicine. Focus has been on rapid collection, analysis and dissemination of information on rare procedures with stress on patient outcome. In complex expensive procedures, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), novel structures are required to catch outcome at team or national level. The annual activity survey of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplants EBMT forms such an instrument. Since 1990, EBMT has been collecting, on an annual basis, numbers of HSCT from the preceding year according to indication, donor type and stem cell source. The survey covers all European countries. In 1990, 143 teams reported 4,234 HSCT; in the year 2000, 619 teams reported 19,136 HSCT (33% allogeneic, 67% autologous). This information, which covers over 90% of all HSCT performed in Europe and is based on 132,963 HSCT (33% allogeneic, 67% autologous), gives a clear overview of current status and ongoing trends. It shows the general increase in HSCT from 1990 to 2000 with few exceptions, such as autologous HSCT for breast cancer and allogeneic HSCT for chronic myeloid leukemia. It illustrates the shift in technology from bone marrow as stem cell source in 1990 (100%) to peripheral blood in 2000 (96% of autologous, 53% of allogeneic HSCT). Supplemented by population data and economic factors (Gross national Product, Health Care Expenditures, Health Care systems) of the individual countries it allows comparison of transplant rates (Number of transplants per 10 million inhabitants), team densities (Number of transplant teams per 10 million inhabitants) and trends between countries. It permits quantification of the impact of economics and health care systems and provides a basis for quality control and allows assessment of the main factors influencing team decisions: evidence, disease prevalence, economics and expectations.

Wang FR and we proved in mice and in clinical pharmaceutical study that ground Seman platycladi as an excipient can appreciably increase the blood level of arsenic when taken P.O. together with As4S4. Our clinical study with 130 patients with t(15;17) APL showed both As4S4 and As2S3 alone were very effective in CR induction, including cytogenetic remission and PML-RAR reversion, yet the relapse rate was higher in the group treated by As4S4 alone than in the group treated together with other autileukemic agents, either together or in sequence.

Chemotherapy was then followed. In patients with leukocytosis, chemotherapeutic agents such as hydroxyurea or harringtonine was added at the beginning and then followed by anthracycline and asparaginase. The reasons of APL relapse after patients receiving As4S4 P.O. were: 1: emergence of a resistant cell clone showing additional chromosomal abnormalities other than t(15;17); 2: decrease of blood As level. The resistant APL case could respond favorably to combination of As4S4 P.O. together with ATRA. The blood level of As could be raised by modification of the preparation under investigation.

When peripheral blood lymphocyte collected from patients every 2-4 weeks after DLI were subjected to complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 size distribution analysis of T-cell receptor beta chain, clonal proliferation of a limited number of CD4+ T cells was detected in all patients 2-4 months after DLI in association with the occurrence of GVL effect. To identify an epitope of the T-cell clone that probably mediates GVL effect, we determined nucleotide sequence of CDR3 of the T cells and screened the database for the presence of T cells with a CDR3 sequence similar to that of the GVL-mediating T cells. In one of 4 patients who showed clonal proliferation of a BV16+ T cell, a CDR3 motif QDR was shared by a T-cell clone that recognized an 85-99 peptide of myelin basic protein presented by HLA-DRB1*1501. When the I domain of CD49b, a candidate peptides that could bind to this CDR3 motif in the context of DRB1*1501, was studied, codon 256 in the I domain of the recipient was ATT (Ile) while that of the donor was GTT (Val). The BV16+ T cells showed proliferative response to DRB1*1501 L-cell transfectant pulsed with the recipient type CD49b. Thus, identification of a clonotype of T cells that mediate GVL effect in patients receiving DLI and a search for T-cell clones with a similar clonotype to the GVL-mediating T cells followed by screening of polymorphic peptides that could stimulate the T cells appears to be useful in identifying novel mHas serving a target antigens of GVL effect.","['Nakao, Shinji']",['Nakao S'],"['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165261 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 1:274-6. doi: 10.1007/BF03165261.,,,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A remission rate of 80% can be achieved by several schedules, and 40-45% of patients diagnosed will survive. It may still be possible to improve remission induction treatment eg by intensifying the Ara-C dose although may this only be detectable in an improved disease free survival. The is to reduce relapse. The risk main challenge is pre-determined by a number of powerful risk factors. In the experience of the MRC age, cytogenetics and clearance of blasts from the bone marrow after course 1. Using the later two in combination good risk patients (FAB M3, t(8;21) t(15;17) inv(16)) have a relapse risk of 32%. Poor risk (blasts >15% after course 1 or abnormalities of Chs 5 or 7, 3q- and complex changes have a relapse risk of 82%. All other cases are standard risk and ve a relapse risk of 56%. FLT3 mutations have been detected in about 25% of cases and provide additional negative predictive value overall and within each risk group. The assessment of the most effective consolidation treatment must be made taking into account the heterogeneity of the relapse risk. The MRC investigated the role of allo and autoBMT in addition to intensive chemotherapy. The data was analysis on an intent-to-treat or donor vs no donor basis. Although both types of transplant were able to reduce relapse overall and in all risk groups, there was an overall survival advantage only in standard risk patients. Since chemotherapy has improved since this study, there remains uncertainty about the benefit of transplant in all risk groups. Overall this experience has demonstrated that relapse can be reduced with more therapy. It is probable that the limits of conventional chemotherapy have been reached. The new AML15 trial will assess the value of adding the immunoconjugate (Mylotarg) to induction and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in older patients have been less detectable. MRC trials over the last 20 years show an improvement in remission rate (now 65%) but persistent poor survival (12% at 5 years). In the MRC AML11 Trial three induction schedules were compared (DAT vs ADE vs MAC) with DAT being superior. A comparison of a total of 3 vs 6 courses of treatment or the addition of interferon maintenance did not improve results. Newer approaches currently being assessed include resistance modulation; addition of immunoconjugate and minigrafts.

The therapeutic approach to these disorders is basically chemotherapy for achieving complete remission based on the concept of total cell kill. However, severe side effects and complications such as serious infection and bleeding due to anti-cancer drugs are major problems in the clinical setting. In addition, repeated episodes of relapse of the disease may lead to refractory or chemotherapy-resistant disorders. These problems are occurred because anti-cancer agents have effects on both cancer cells and normal hematopoietic cells. The clinical evidences thus suggest the limitations of the chemotherapy for hematological malignancies: novel effective therapeutic approaches with less toxicity are therefore actively being sought. Differentiation-inducing therapy employing a physiologically active derivative of vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), brought remarkably advances in the therapeutic outcome of APL at the end of last century. More recently, the clinical success of imatinib mesylate (STI571), potent competitive inhibitor of the Bcr/Abl protein tyrosine kinase, in the treatment of CML has focused enthusiasm toward molecular targeted therapy for the hematological malignancies. The therapeutic activity of these agents can be explained by their abilities to modify cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in cells by activating unknown gene programs that molecular cellular proliferation. We have actively sought out new agents among natural products and cytokines with the ability to induce cellular differentiation and apoptosis. In this symposium, I will present our recent data of these novel compounds and their molecular mechanisms for inducing differentiation and apoptosis of hematological malignant cells.","['Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Ito, Keisuke', 'Kawamura, Chiharu', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Ikeda, Yasuo']","['Kizaki M', 'Nakazato T', 'Ito K', 'Kawamura C', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Phytotherapy']",2002/11/15 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03165253 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76 Suppl 1:250-2. doi: 10.1007/BF03165253.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that Th2 cells suppress GVHD although Thl cells augment GVHD. Chimerism analysis showed that mixed chimerism was often observed in younger (<30 years old) patients. Mixed chimerism in older (> or = 30 years old) patients were related to rejection and relapse while this situation is not the case in younger patients, thus indicating that mixed chimerism is an important prognostic factor in older patients. Among the chimerism of various cell populations, donor-derived CD56-positive cells are important in early engraftment when determined in allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (allo-NST), regardless of the proportion of donor-derived CD3-positive cells. This result suggests that donor-derived CD56-positive cells are a more useful indicator for engraftment and rejection in early time period. Complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) size spectratyping in T-cell receptor (TCR) chain subfamilies (V beta) showed that high level of diversity in TCR V beta repertoire is important for a late rejection and skewed TCR V repertoire is well correlated to occurrence of GVHD. Expression of inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptors such as CD158b and CD94/NKG2A on peripheral CD3-negative and positive cells were increased in parallel with GVHD.

Unfortunately it carries a high risk of complications and toxicities related to the intensive preparative regimen which is traditionally used for pre-transplant myeloablation and the graft versus host disease, which may be life threatening. Thus allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been used only for younger patients with a good performance status, excluding many other potential candidates due to advanced age or comorbid conditions. Non ablative or reduced intensity preparative regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NST) have been proposed as a strategy that would allow exploiting the graft versus tumor effect of allogeneic transplantation without the toxicity of myeloablative therapy. After more than five years of cumulative clinical experience, it is now well established that NST is a feasible treatment option for patients with suboptimal performance status and is mostly effective in slow proliferating malignancies, which gives time for a graft versus malignancy effect to take place. Additionally achievement of stable donor cell engraftment with NSTs provides a platform for adoptive immune cell treatments and may allow to extend indications of stem cell transplantation in the future.","['Giralt, S']",['Giralt S'],"['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation of the University of Texas MD.

The 1993-95 conditioning protocol included TBI, thiotepa, ATG and CY for 36 patients who received an inoculum made up of lectin-separated bone marrow and PBPCs. After 1995, to minimise the extra-hematological toxicity of the conditioning and eliminate GvHD, we substituted fludarabine for CY in the conditioning and PBPCs were depleted of T-cells by a positive selection of the CD34+ cells using CellPro (n=44 patients) or, since January 1999, CliniMacs (n = 53 patients). A later modification to the protocol in January 1999 was the suspension of post transplant G-CSF. WORK IN PROGRESS: We report here the results in the last 53 acute leukemia patients all of whom were transplanted under our modified protocol. Ages ranged from 9 to 62 years with a median of 38 years for the 33 patients with AML and 23 for the 20 with ALL. All were at high risk because 25 were actually in relapse at transplant, 16 were in second or later CR and even the 12 patients in CR1 were at high risk because of the unfavourable prognostic features. Overall 52/53 patients (98%) engrafted. The TBI-Fludarabine-based conditioning was well tolerated even in the 14 patients between 45 and 62 years of age. There was no veno-occlusive disease of the liver and the incidence of severe mucositis was low. Even though no post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy was given, acute GvHD grade > or = II occurred in only 4 cases and only one progressed to chronic GvHD. Overall, 16 patients (30%) have died of non-leukemic causes. Relapses occurred mainly in patients who were already in relapse at transplant (12/25). Only 3 of the 28 who were in any CR at transplant have so far relapsed. As our group has already shown, donor-vs-recipient NK cell alloreactivity exerts a specific graft-vs-AML effect in the absence of GvHD. In fact, leukemia relapse was largely controlled in AML recipients whose donor was NK alloreactive, with only 2 out of 16 relapsing. To date, 13 of 18 AML (72%) and 5 of 10 ALL (50%) who were in any CR at transplant, survive disease-free while 4 of the 15 patients (16%) in relapse at transplant survive.

Using various autoimmune-prone mice, we have previously shown that conventional allogeneic (allo) BMT can be used to treat a range of autoimmune diseases. We have very recently established new strategies for BMT and organ grafts. For BMT, to minimize the contamination of BMCs with T cells from the peripheral blood, we developed, using cynomolgus monkeys, a ""Perfusion Method"" to replace the conventional aspiration method for collecting bone marrow cells (BMCs). We injected the BMCs collected this way directly into the bone marrow cavity of recipients that had received fractionated irradiation (intra-bone marrow [IBM] injection). This ""IBM-BMT"" was found to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases in radiation-sensitive and chimeric-resistant MRL/lpr mice. in addition, this strategy was found to be applicable for the transplantation of organs, such as the skin and pancreas islets in mice and rats.

However, the cause of premature aging in this strain remains unknown. We analyzed the expression of ecotropic, xenotropic, and polytropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) in the brains of accelerated senescence-resistant (SAMR1) and SAMP8 mice. No ecotropic mRNA was detected in SAMR1 mice, and only Akv-type ecotropic MuLV mRNA was detected in SAMP8 mice. Restriction mapping of the full-length infectious E-MuLV genome from SAMP8 confirmed its identity as Akv. mRNAs corresponding to a prototypical polytropic MuLV and to an unusual xenotropic MuLV were detected at equal levels in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice, but no infectious virus of either host range type was detected. In order to determine the cellular localization of Akv expression in SAMP8 mice, we used immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to detect expression of the E-MuLV capsid gag (CAgag) gene in striatum, brainstem, hippocampus, and cerebellum of 12-month-old SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice. The CAgag antigen was seen in the neurons, oligodendroglia, and vascular endothelium of these brain regions of SAMP8 mice, but not in SAMR1 mice. To evaluate the correlation between activation of astrocytes and expression of Akv, we performed double-immunohistochemical staining for both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CAgag in SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice. Strong astrocytic activation and extensive vacuolation were observed around CAgag-positive neurons in SAMP8 mice, whereas in SAMR1 mice neither astrocytosis nor vacuolation were present. CAgag antigen was also localized in astrocytes of the hippocampus region of SAMP8 mice. Electron micrography showed that a number of vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm of MuLV-positive neurons and the extracellular space surrounding these neurons showed lytic changes. These results suggest that endogenous Akv provirus is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, vascular endothelium, and oligodendroglia in the brains of SAMP8 and that this virus could play an important role in the brain aging processes in this mouse strain.","['Jeong, Byung Hoon', 'Jin, Jae Kwang', 'Choi, Eun Kyoung', 'Lee, Eun Young', 'Meeker, H C', 'Kozak, Christine A', 'Carp, Richard I', 'Kim, Yong Sun']","['Jeong BH', 'Jin JK', 'Choi EK', 'Lee EY', 'Meeker HC', 'Kozak CA', 'Carp RI', 'Kim YS']","['Ilsong Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chunchon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,IM,"['Aging, Premature/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/genetics', 'Astrocytes/pathology/ultrastructure/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nerve Degeneration/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Neurons/pathology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2002/11/15 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnen/61.11.1001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2002 Nov;61(11):1001-12. doi: 10.1093/jnen/61.11.1001.,,,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They increase in number during aging, and their formation is considered to represent a cellular reaction to stress, but is not always associated with neuronal degeneration. We conducted immunohistochemical studies on MBs abundant in myotonic dystrophy brains and compared their nature with that of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) in polyglutamine diseases. First, we examined the relationship between MBs and polyglutamine proteins and demonstrated that one of the polyglutamine proteins, ataxin-3, as well as a 19S proteasomal protein, was preferentially recruited into MBs even in the absence of expanded polyglutamine. This indicates that an alternative mechanism during the formation of MBs that is not related to polyglutamine expansion or neuronal degeneration may recruit ataxin-3 into nuclear inclusions in a protein-specific manner. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between MBs and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a nuclear matrix-associated protein that is normally localized to intranuclear punctate structures (PML nuclear bodies) and is known to reorganize itself in association with polyglutamine aggregation. In nigral pigmented neurons in myotonic dystrophy, spherical, hemispherical or rod-like PML-immunoreactive structures, in addition to punctate structures, were observed in their nuclei. Similar PML redistribution was also observed in nigral pigmented neurons in aged controls and cases of hepatic encephalopathy, 2 other conditions in which abundant MBs are formed. Double immunofluorescence study revealed that these PML-positive structures undergo morphological changes in association with ubiquitin accumulation during MB formation. It is therefore indicated that PML reorganization does not represent a specific nuclear event involved in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases, but may commonly occur during the formation of intranuclear inclusions as a reaction against various stresses that involve the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","['Kumada, Satoko', 'Uchihara, Toshiki', 'Hayashi, Masaharu', 'Nakamura, Ayako', 'Kikuchi, Etsuko', 'Mizutani, Toshio', 'Oda, Masaya']","['Kumada S', 'Uchihara T', 'Hayashi M', 'Nakamura A', 'Kikuchi E', 'Mizutani T', 'Oda M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Metropolitan Fuchu Medical Center for Severe Motor and Intellectual Disabilities, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ataxin-3', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hepatic Encephalopathy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Myotonic Dystrophy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics/metabolism', 'Substantia Nigra/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin/genetics/metabolism']",2002/11/15 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnen/61.11.984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2002 Nov;61(11):984-91. doi: 10.1093/jnen/61.11.984.,,,"['0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (ATXN3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ataxin-3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients have a spectrum of birth defects, which are relatively characteristic for each syndrome. but overlap in features such as poor growth. radial ray anomalies, and involvement of skin, eyes, renal, cardiac, skeletal, and other organs. Within each syndrome the composition and severity of the physical phenotype varies widely, and it may require the astute observer to make the correct diagnoses in the milder cases. There is also a wide spectrum to the hematologic picture. These range from single cytopenias such as DBA, SCN, and TAR, which do not develop pancytopenia, to SD and Amega patients who begin with deficiency of a specific single lineage, but evolve to aplastic anemia, to patients with FA or DC, who may present with a deficiency of any one of the cell lines, but almost inevitably end up with full-blown aplastic anemia. Acute myeloid leukemia has been observed in FA, DBA, DC, SD, SCN, and Amega, although not yet in TAR patients. MDS has also been reported in all of the same disorders as AML, although whether it is a preleukemic condition or an independent bone marrow dyspoiesis is not yet clear. Solid tumors are also now appearing in patients whose underlying disease involves hematopoiesis and physical development. These tumors occur at much younger ages than in the general population, in patients who do not appear to have the usual risk factors, and have patterns that are characteristic to the syndrome, such as head and neck and gynecologic cancers in FA and DC, and osteogenic sarcomas in DBA. The other syndromes have not yet been reported to have a propensity for solid tumors. Several genes have been identified that are mutant in some of the syndromes, although the pathophysiology is still not entirely clear. The inheritance patterns include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and even mitochondrial. The FA gene products appear to cooperate, and are important in the pathways involved in response to DNA damage. However, the role of this pathway in developmental defects, hematopoietic failure, and the specific malignancies in FA is not fully elucidated. The DC gene products are important for maintenance of telomere length, which may have relevance to development of aplastic anemia and malignancies, but the relation to the physical phenotype is less apparent. The role of mutations in c-mpl in Amega is more straightforward. since the gene codes for the receptor for thrombopoietin. which is the hormone required for megakaryocyte and platelet development; patients with mutant c-mpl do not have birth defects. The role of mutations in RPS19 in erythropoiesis or developmental defects in DBA patients is not obvious, and the increased frequency of osteogenic sarcomas suggests that at least that subset of patients may have a mutant tumor suppressor gene (such as p53, the mutant gene in Li-Fraumeni syndrome) [68]. Although patients with SCN have mutations in neutrophil elastase, patients with similar mutations may have relatively benign cyclic neutropenia, or may even have normal neutrophil levels [69,70]. The mitochondrial gene deletions in Pearson's Syndrome result in variable degrees of acidosis, and varied organ involvement due to heteroplasmy. Thus, the disorders included under the rubric ""inherited bone marrow failure syndromes"" have clinical. hematologic, oncologic, and genetic diversity.","['Alter, Blanche P']",['Alter BP'],"['Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20854-7231, USA. alterb@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Syndrome']",2002/11/15 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0031-3955(02)00031-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00031-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Clin North Am. 2002 Oct;49(5):973-88. doi: 10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00031-7.,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully defined in solid tumor cells, especially cervical cancer cells carrying human papillomavirus (HPV) genome. To analyze detailed mechanisms in vitro, we treated As2O3 to transformed HeLa cells, a well-studied cervical cancer cell line carrying HPV-18 sequence, and investigated its antiproliferative, antiviral and antimetastatic effects. As2O3 reduced survival and growth of HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Several indicatives of apoptosis were demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay, DAPI nuclear staining and FACS analysis, respectively. Protein levels of p53 and cleavage of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase were increased in a dose-dependent manner following treatment of As2O3. In parallel, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the treatment inhibited HPV-18 E6/E7 viral gene expression in HeLa cells. Using transient transfection and CAT ELISA, we also found that AP-1 sites, located proximal to HPV-18 upstream regulatory region (URR) promoter, could be the major target sites for As2O3. Furthermore, As2O3-treated HeLa cells showed lesser capacity of invasion than those of untreated cells by in vitro invasion assay. Taken together, we proposed that antiviral effect, i.e. down-regulation of HPV E6/E7 oncogenes through targeting for AP-1 sites located in HPV URR might be associated with antiproliferative effect, i.e. induction of apoptosis as be resulted from the accumulation of p53, and that antimetastatic effect could be due to the targeted inactivation of AP-1, a transcription factor required for the expression of MMP-1 and -3. Therefore, our finding may provide a logical basis for the development of a new agent treating HPV-associated cervical neoplasia.","['Um, Soo-Jong', 'Lee, So-Young', 'Kim, Eun-Joo', 'Myoung, Jin', 'Namkoong, Sung-Eun', 'Park, Jong-Sup']","['Um SJ', 'Lee SY', 'Kim EJ', 'Myoung J', 'Namkoong SE', 'Park JS']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology/Institute of Bioscience, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*virology']",2002/11/15 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/11/15 04:00'],"['2002/11/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(02)00039-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00039-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Jul 8;181(1):11-22. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00039-3.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (E7 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The route of VCR induced apoptosis in ALL cells is not well defined. In this study we demonstrated caspase-9 and -3 activation in vivo in bone marrow leukaemic cells of a child with newly diagnosed ALL, after treatment with a single dose of VCR. We hypothesized that VCR induced apoptosis in ALL cells proceeds by a mitochondrial controlled pathway. We further studied the route of VCR induced apoptosis in Jurkat acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. First we showed that VCR induces activation of caspase-9 and -3 in Jurkat cells. With the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK we proved that caspase-9 was activated prior to caspase-3. Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was independent of caspase-9 activation. To confirm the mitochondrial role in VCR induced apoptosis, the effect of blocking the mitochondrial route upstream of caspase-9 activation was investigated at two different levels: reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and Bcl-2 overexpression. Generation of ROS was detected early in Jurkat cells during VCR exposure. Ascorbic acid, a ROS scavenger, inhibited ROS generation as well as caspase-9 and -3 activation and cell death induced by VCR. Furthermore, in Bcl-2 overexpressing Jurkat cells mitochondrial membrane potential changes, caspase-9 and -3 activation and cell death upon VCR exposure were decreased, in comparison to parental Jurkat cells. However, generation of ROS was not decreased in Jurkat cells with Bcl-2 overexpression. We concluded that ROS play a regulatory role in the initial phase of a mitochondrial controlled pathway of VCR induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.","['Groninger, E', 'Meeuwsen-De Boer, G J', 'De Graaf, S S N', 'Kamps, W A', 'De Bont, E S J M']","['Groninger E', 'Meeuwsen-De Boer GJ', 'De Graaf SS', 'Kamps WA', 'De Bont ES']","[""Division of Paediatric Oncology Haematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2002/11/14 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.21.6.1339 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Dec;21(6):1339-45. doi: 10.3892/ijo.21.6.1339.,,,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coadministratation of 100 nM UCN-01 with a low concentration of PMA e.g., 2 nM, inhibited rather than promoted differentiation, reflected by reduced surface expression of the monocytic maturation marker CD11b and diminished cell adherence. Instead, administration of UCN-01 with PMA led to a marked increase in mitochondrial injury (e.g, cytochrome c release), activation of caspases-3 and -8, Bid cleavage, PARP degradation, and apoptosis, accompanied by a substantial reduction in viability and clonogenic survival. These phenomena were associated with multiple perturbations in cell cycle regulatory events, including abrogation of p21(CIP1) induction, p27(KIP1) cleavage, down-regulation of cyclin D1, dephosphorylation (activation) of p34cdc2, and degradation of underphosphorylated pRb. Potentiation of PMA-mediated apoptosis was partially mimicked by caffeine suggesting the involvement of Chk1 in the potentiation of apoptosis. Induction of cell death by UCN-01 and PMA was increased in cells stably expressing a p21(CIP1) mRNA antisense construct, suggesting that p21(CIP1) expression may protect cells from the lethal effects of this drug combination. Finally, ectopic expression of a Bcl-2 but not dominant-negative caspase-8 protected cells from UCN-01/PMA-mediated apoptosis, suggesting the lethal effects of this combination primarily involves the mitochondrial rather than the TNF-related extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that UCN-01 disrupts a variety of cell cycle events in leukemic cells exposed to the maturation-inducing agent PMA, causing cells to engage an apoptotic rather than a differentiation-related program.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Carcinogens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', '*Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/11/14 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['04290238 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.1.4.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2002 Jul-Aug;1(4):273-81. doi: 10.4161/cc.1.4.137.,,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['Cell Cycle. 2002 Jul-Aug;1(4):258-9.

However, evidence has accumulated that As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis regardless of PML-RARalpha status. Here we show that, at clinically relevant concentrations, As(2)O(3) causes S and G(2)M phase arrest of both PML-RARalpha-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines, thus inhibiting their growth. Apoptotic cells are generated predominately from the G(2)M fraction. Using several independent methods, we demonstrate that the cells accumulated in the G(2)M peak consist primarily of cells arrested in the early stages of mitosis, prophase, prometaphase and metaphase. In mitotic cells, there was significant activation of caspases, PARP cleavage, and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Unlike microtubule-active drugs that arrest cells in metaphase, arsenic trioxide did not affect the architecture of microtubules. Our data suggest that the antileukemic activities of arsenic may be a result of mitotic arrest which culminates in apoptosis.","['Halicka, H Dorota', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Dai, Wei', 'Traganos, Frank']","['Halicka HD', 'Smolewski P', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Dai W', 'Traganos F']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Hawthorne, New York 10532, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/11/14 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['03120231 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2002 May-Jun;1(3):201-9.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['Cell Cycle. 2002 May-Jun;1(3):183-6.

In U937 cells, CGP74514A- induced apoptosis (5 microM) became apparent within 4 hr and approached 100% by 24 hr. The pan- caspase inhibitor Boc-fmk and the caspase-8 inhibitor lETD-fmk opposed CGP74514A-induced caspase-9 activation and PARP degradation, but not cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO release. CGP74514A-mediated apoptosis was substantially blocked by ectopic expression of full-length Bel- 2, a loop-deleted mutant Bcl-2, and Bcl-x(L).

It also induced early (i.e., within 2 hr) inhibition of CDK1 activity and dephosphorylation of pRb, followed by pRb degradation, but did not block pRb phosphorylation at CDK2- and CDK4- specific sites.

The patients ranged from 54 to 89 years and included three females and three males. All six patients had prominent peripheral blood lymphocytosis at presentation; the initial morphologic impression was CLL in three cases, CLL/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) in two cases, and PLL in one. Five patients had bone marrow biopsies; each showed a lymphoid infiltrate in a focally random, interstitial, and/or diffuse pattern. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed CD20-positive B cells with surface immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain restriction in all six patients. The five cases resembling CLL or CLL/PLL had at least a subset of CD5-positive B cells, whereas CD5 was absent in the one case that resembled PLL. CD23 was positive in three of the four cases studied that resembled CLL or CLL/PLL; CD79b was positive in three, FMC7 was positive in two, and surface Ig and CD20 were brightly positive in three. A t(11;14) (q13;q32) was found in four cases that resembled CLL or CLL/PLL; they were subsequently diagnosed as mantle cell lymphoma.

MM cells express multiple Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, which are thought to play a key role in the survival and drug resistance of myeloma. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has antitumor activity against hematopoietic malignancies, including CLL, in which induction of apoptosis was associated with reduced expression of antiapoptotic proteins. Therefore, we sought to characterize the effect of flavopiridol on the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells and to define its mechanisms of action. Treatment of MM cell lines (8226, ANBL-6, ARP1, and OPM-2) with clinically achievable concentrations of flavopiridol resulted in rapid induction of apoptotic cell death that correlated temporally with the decline in Mcl-1 protein and mRNA levels. Levels of other antiapoptotic proteins did not change. Overexpression of Mcl-1 protected MM cells from flavopiridol-induced apoptosis. Additional analysis demonstrated that flavopiridol treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II COOH-terminal domain, thus blocking transcription elongation. These data indicate that Mcl-1 is an important target for flavopiridol-induced apoptosis of MM that occurs through inhibition of Mcl-1 mRNA transcription coupled with rapid protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","['Gojo, Ivana', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Fenton, Robert G']","['Gojo I', 'Zhang B', 'Fenton RG']","['Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Syndecans', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/11/14 04:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Nov;8(11):3527-38.,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Syndecans)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier findings have supported an association between progressive telomere shortening in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia and the up-regulation of telomerase activity occurring late in the evolution of the disease. We examined the impact of telomerase inhibition by dominant negative-human telomerase reverse transcriptase (DN-hTERT) on the biological features of BCR-ABL-transformed cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We introduced vectors encoding DN-hTERT, wild-type (WT)-hTERT, or a control vector expressing only a drug-resistant marker into Philadelphia chromosome-positive K562 cells and OM9;22 cells and assessed the biological effect of telomerase inhibition on cellular immortality. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of DN-hTERT resulted in complete inhibition of telomerase activity and reduction of telomere length. The entire population of telomerase-inhibited K562 cells exhibited cytoplasmic blebbling and chromatin condensation, features of apoptosis. In contrast, K562 cells expressing WT-hTERT, which differ from the mutants by only two amino acids, exhibited normal morphology. The evidence of apoptosis in the telomerase-inhibited cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis with APO2.7 monoclonal antibody. We also observed enhanced induction of apoptosis by imatinib seen in DN-hTERT-expressing K562 cells, as compared with WT-hTERT-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that disruption of telomere maintenance limits the cellular life span of leukemia cells and show that the combined use of imatinib and telomere maintenance inhibition may be effective in the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia.","['Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Nakajima, Akihiro', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Shimamoto, Takashi', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Abe, Kenji', 'Yamamoto, Kohtaro', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Tauchi T', 'Nakajima A', 'Sashida G', 'Shimamoto T', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Abe K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan. tauchi@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2002/11/14 04:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Nov;8(11):3341-7.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) exhibit a high degree of homotypic cell-cell adhesion in vitro. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the viral protein Tax in such process. Expression of Tax in an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent mouse T cell line (CTLL-2) increased homotypic cell-cell adhesion; however, less cell adhesion was induced by Tax than that observed in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. Moreover, Tax induced cell-cell adhesion in a human T cell line, in which the expression of Tax is inducible. Microscopic examination also revealed Tax-induced morphologic changes, including rounding of CTLL-2 cells, increased cell volume, and increased nucleus size. Taken together, our results suggest that Tax induces cell-cell adhesion and morphologic changes in HTLV-1-infected cells.

The therapy is associated with various non-haematological negative side-effects, frequently involving the skin. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the actual occurrence of adverse skin reactions to HDAC over the 10-year period from 1989 to 1999. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-two subjects, 118 with acute myelogenous leukaemia and 54 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, between 16 and 71 years of age were treated with 226 post-remission consolidation regimens with HDAC (54 subjects underwent two cycles of treatment). Treatment was combined with standard doses of other cytotoxic drugs. A prospective study of the skin changes was then performed. RESULTS: The overall incidence of cutaneous reactions was almost 53%, with rashes occurring in 72.7% and 40.6% of subjects who received total doses of 30 and 24 g/m2, respectively. In the group of subjects who received a second cycle of treatment not all of those who experienced exanthema after the first cycle (44.4%) experienced this reaction after the second cycle (only 33.3%). The most commonly observed reactions were morbilliform eruptions on the trunk and extremities and acral erythema, although severe reactions with swelling and generalized urticaria developed in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: HDAC-induced cutaneous reactions in 53% of subjects. The skin changes were found to be dose related and most cleared spontaneously without requiring treatment. A clinical grading of cutaneous toxicity has been proposed to allow better comparison of cutaneous adverse effects in different reports.","['Cetkovska, P', 'Pizinger, K', 'Cetkovsky, P']","['Cetkovska P', 'Pizinger K', 'Cetkovsky P']","['Department of Dermatology, Charles University Hospital, Pilsen, The Czech Republic. cetkovska@fnplzen.cz']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Eruptions/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",2002/11/14 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1468-3083.2002.00395.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2002 Sep;16(5):481-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-3083.2002.00395.x.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore desirable to eradicate the cancer cell fraction of the graft without causing damage to the normal stem cell fraction. The purging processes based on photodynamic treatments appear to be perspective means for this purpose. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)--based photodynamic treatment (ALA-PDT) on the proliferation of human leukemia cell lines HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia), ML2 (myelomonocytic leukemia) and HEL (erythroleukemia) by 3H-thymidine incorporation into the cell DNA, on the viability of cell lines HL60, HEL, DAUDI (B-cell leukemia) and JURKAT (T-cell lymphoma) as well as of blast cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by flow cytometry-propidium iodide assay, and on the clonogenic activities of normal human bone marrow cells by in vitro cloning assays. Under the conditions used (treatment with 1 mM ALA for 4 h at 37 degrees C followed by exposure to blue light dose of 18 J/cm2) the number of proliferating HL60 cells was reduced by 2.4 logs, of ML2 cells by 3.2 logs and of HEL cells by 1 log. From the mononuclear cell preparations of AML patients the blast cells were substantially reduced in eight out of ten patients. The clonogenic activities of normal bone marrow progenitor cells were largely spared: 52.5 +/- 8.9% of colony-forming units--granulocytes macrophages (CFU-GM), and 48.6 +/- 9.7% burst forming units--erythrocytes (BFU-E). CONCLUSIONS: ALA-PDT appears to be usable principle for the depletion of residual leukemic cells from autologous transplants.","['Hrkal, Z', 'Grebenova, D', 'Cajthamlova, H', 'Soucek, J', 'Bartosova, J', 'Fuchs, O', 'Marinov, I', 'Kobylka, P', 'Klamova, H', 'Sponerova, D']","['Hrkal Z', 'Grebenova D', 'Cajthamlova H', 'Soucek J', 'Bartosova J', 'Fuchs O', 'Marinov I', 'Kobylka P', 'Klamova H', 'Sponerova D']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. hrkal@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/11/14 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2002 Sep 22;141 Suppl:41-6.,,Vyuziti fotodynamicke terapie k odstranovani rezidualnich leukemickych bunek z autolognich transplantatu hematopoetickych progenitorovych bunek.,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Correlations of clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients were evaluated. Using classical cytogenetic techniques we found 11q aberration in 17 patients with different hematological malignancies. FISH with dual color locus specific probe for MLL gene was used to confirm or exclude the rearrangement of this gene. Whole chromosome painting probes and multicolor FISH were performed for identification of chromosomes involved in complex translocations. Balanced rearrangements of 11q were found in 3 patients, in 14 patients unbalanced aberrations were found with rearrangement (4), deletion (4) and amplification (2) of MLL gene. In 7 patients no rearrangement of MLL gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients was not significant, therefore further studies of larger cohort of patients are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of 11q rearrangement.","['Brezinova, J', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Kurkova, S', 'Sindelarova, L', 'Siskova, M', 'Cermak, J', 'Michalova, K']","['Brezinova J', 'Zemanova Z', 'Kurkova S', 'Sindelarova L', 'Siskova M', 'Cermak J', 'Michalova K']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. brez@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/11/14 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2002 Sep 22;141 Suppl:38-40.,,Prestavby 11q u nemocnych s hematologickymi malignitami.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: The patients were classified according to the FAB criteria and divided into risk groups according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). A separate evaluation of 34 patients who underwent stem cell transplantation and of 163 of those not transplanted was performed. Median survival of not transplanted patients with RAEB (10.0 months) and RAEB-T (12.0 months) was significantly shorter than survival of RA (62.4 months) and RARS (48.1 months, P < 0.001) patients as well as survival of patients included in intermediate II. (13.8 months) and high (10.8 months) risk subgroups when compared to those with low (74.9 months) and intermediate I. risk (56.0 months, P < 0.001). A similar difference was observed in percentage of patients evolving towards acute leukemia and in estimated 3 years survival (EFS). EFS of RA patients was 57% in contrast to 4% in RAEB-T group (P < 0.001) in the same way, EFS in low risk subgroup was 79% vs. 3% in high risk patients (P < 0.001). Chemotherapy alone did not significantly affect median survival of patients with advanced MDS when compared with supportive care. On the contrary, median survival of transplanted patients with RAEB and RAEB-T was 38.4 months in comparison to 11.5 months in those not transplanted (P < 0.001) and 36.8 months vs. 12.0 months in transplanted and not transplanted patients with intermediate II. and high risk (P = 0.05). The difference in survival between transplanted and not transplanted patients with RA and in patients in low and intermediate I. risk subgroups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed an adverse effect of excess of blasts on prognosis of patients with primary MDS. Stem cell transplantation had a significant beneficial effect on survival of patients with RAEB or RAEB-T as well as of patients included in intermediate II. or high risk subgroups. The impact of stem cell transplantation on survival of patients with RA or with low or intermediate I. risk was not significant. Therefore, further criteria should be taken in account for indication of stem cell transplantation in these subgroups of patients.","['Cermak, J', 'Michalova, K', 'Vitek, A']","['Cermak J', 'Michalova K', 'Vitek A']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. cermak@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/complications/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2002/11/14 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/11/14 04:00'],"['2002/11/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2002 Sep 22;141 Suppl:33-7.,,"Myelodysplasticky syndrom--klasifikace, prognoza a lecba nemocnych.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This often is the result of molecular alterations in transcription factors that lead to their misrouting within the nucleus. The acute myelogenous leukemia-related fusion protein AML1ETO is a striking example. It originates from a gene rearrangement t(8;21) that fuses the N-terminal part of the key hematopoietic regulatory factor AML1 (RUNX1) to the ETO (MTG8) repressor protein. AML1ETO lacks the intranuclear targeting signal of the wild-type AML1 and is directed by the ETO component to alternate nuclear matrix-associated sites. To understand this aberrant subnuclear trafficking of AML1ETO, we created a series of mutations in the ETO protein. These were characterized biochemically by immunoblotting and in situ by immunofluorescence microscopy. We identified two independent subnuclear targeting signals in the N- and C-terminal regions of ETO that together direct ETO to the same binding sites occupied by AML1ETO. However, each segment alone is targeted to a different intranuclear location. The N-terminal segment contains a nuclear localization signal and the conserved hydrophobic heptad repeat domain responsible for protein dimerization and interaction with the mSin3A transcriptional repressor. The C-terminal segment spans the nervy domain and the zinc finger region, which together support interactions with the corepressors N-CoR and HDACs. Our findings provide a molecular basis for aberrant subnuclear targeting of the AML1ETO protein, which is a principal defect in t(8;21)-related acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Barseguian, Karina', 'Lutterbach, Bart', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Nickerson, Jeffrey', 'Lian, Jane B', 'Stein, Janet L', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Barseguian K', 'Lutterbach B', 'Hiebert SW', 'Nickerson J', 'Lian JB', 'Stein JL', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655-0106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Sorting Signals/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/11/13 04:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/11/13 04:00'],"['2002/11/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.242588499 [doi]', '242588499 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 26;99(24):15434-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.242588499.

Indeed, exogenous Tat protein can increase cell adhesion molecule gene expression in human endothelial cells. Signaling pathways initiated by Tat in endothelial cells are not known. We evaluated the ability of endogenous tat to stimulate monocyte adhesion via activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) within human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Transfection with pcTat, but not control vector DNA, increased NF-kappaB binding activity, NF-kappaB luciferase reporter activity, and monocyte adhesion. pcTat also increased kappaB-dependent HIV-1-LTR-CAT reporter activity 28-fold compared with a 3-fold increase produced by transfection with an equivalent amount of pcTax (from human leukemia virus). The pcTat-induced increase in pNF-kappaB-Luc activity and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was blocked by cotransfection with dominant-negative mutant IkappaBalpha and by incubation with 10 mM aspirin. We conclude that monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells stimulated by pcTat is mediated via an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, inhibition studies using aspirin suggest that pcTat-stimulated NF-kappaB activation and monocyte adhesion occur via a redox-sensitive mechanism.","['Pieper, Galen M', 'Olds, Cara L', 'Bub, Jeffrey D', 'Lindholm, Paul F']","['Pieper GM', 'Olds CL', 'Bub JD', 'Lindholm PF']","['Division of Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA. gmpieper@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

As a systematic study, we selected one up-regulated EST (GenBank Accession number N47089) and further investigated. An LGL leukemia library was screened using this EST as a probe and a full-length sequence for a novel gene was identified.

At the present time, our knowledge of biological activities along the process is incomplete, therefore, a variety of experimental data are used to assess health risk from exposure to environmental chemicals. However, experimental approaches may not be adequate unless human data are available to support the assessment. In this brief review, benzene (CAS No. 71-43-2), a well-established human leukemogen, will be used as an example to illustrate the challenge in assessing toxicological mechanisms and cancer risk. Benzene has been shown to form DNA-adducts in experimental animals but the adducts have proved elusive of detection in human. Several toxic metabolites of benzene have been identified but the metabolite(s) responsible for the carcinogenic activities is unknown. Furthermore, the significant differences between rodents and human in response to benzene exposure are not understood. Therefore, the bone marrow specificity for the induction of leukemia in human by benzene remains to be elucidated. These complications illustrate the complexity of the assessment process and identify serious information gaps. These information gaps can be viewed as research opportunities to provide more precise data for assessment of toxicological effects and health risk.","['Au, William W', 'Oberheitmann, Boris', 'Harms, Carsten']","['Au WW', 'Oberheitmann B', 'Harms C']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, The University of Texas Medical Branch, 700 Harborside Drive, Galveston, TX 77555-1110, USA. william.au@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/toxicity', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Damage', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Risk Assessment']",2002/11/13 04:00,2002/12/21 04:00,['2002/11/13 04:00'],"['2002/11/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0027510702002269 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-5107(02)00226-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2002 Nov 30;509(1-2):153-63. doi: 10.1016/s0027-5107(02)00226-9.,81,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,['ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, numerous studies indicated that green tea catechins (GTC) could suppress the growth and induce apoptosis on a number of human cancer cell lines. However, the differentiation-inducing activity of GTC on human tumors remains poorly understood. In the present study, the effect of the major GTC epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the proliferation and differentiation of a human eosinophilc leukemic cell line, EoL-1, was examined. Our results showed that EGCG suppressed the proliferation of the EoL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated IC(50) value of 31.5 microM. On the other hand, EGCG at a concentration of 40 microM could trigger the EoL-1 cells to undergo morphological differentiation into mature eosinophil-like cells. Using RT-PCR and flow cytometry, it was found that EGCG upregulated the gene and protein expression of two eosinophil-specific granule proteins, the major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), in EoL-1 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that EGCG can exhibit anti-leukemic activity on a human eosinophilic cell line EoL-1 by suppressing the proliferation and by inducing the differentiation of the leukemia cells.","['Lung, H L', 'Ip, W K', 'Wong, C K', 'Mak, N K', 'Chen, Z Y', 'Leung, K N']","['Lung HL', 'Ip WK', 'Wong CK', 'Mak NK', 'Chen ZY', 'Leung KN']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophil Peroxidase', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Kinetics', 'Peroxidases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Ribonucleases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/13 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/11/13 04:00'],"['2002/11/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320502022361 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(02)02236-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2002 Dec 6;72(3):257-68. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(02)02236-1.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Eosinophil Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of trials have involved the use of lymphocytes transduced with vectors promoting resistance to HIV infection or replication. Unfortunately, the results have been less than encouraging with low-level marking and, more importantly, clearance of these lymphocytes from the circulation. Conversely, gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells appear able to introduce foreign transgenes while avoiding immunologic clearance. Furthermore, the use of less toxic conditioning regimens for allogeneic transplantation provides an attractive approach to conferring HIV resistance while allowing treatment of HIV-related disorders such as malignancies. This combination of nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation using gene-modified hematopoietic stem cell theoretically overcomes the high transplant mortality associated with traditional conditioning regimens in patients with HIV as well as providing a self-renewing source of HIV-resistant cells. To assess the safety and feasibility of such an approach, a clinical protocol was initiated in those patients infected with HIV with a hematologic malignancy meeting the standard indications for allogeneic transplantation and provided here is an update to the previously published original report. Only patient 1 received genetically modified cells. Both patients tolerated the procedure with no effect on viral load and improved CD4 counts, and patient 1 remains in complete remission from acute myelogenous leukemia 3 years post transplant. Patient 2 also achieved clinical remission from chemorefractory Hodgkin's disease but died of relapsed disease 12 months after transplantation. Vector-transduced cells remain detectable at low levels more than 3 years post-transplantation, suggesting the potential for gene therapy as a reasonable goal for the treatment of HIV.","['Kang, Elizabeth M', 'De Witte, Moniek', 'Malech, Harry', 'Morgan, Richard A', 'Carter, Charles', 'Leitman, Susan F', 'Childs, Richard', 'Barrett, A John', 'Little, Richard', 'Tisdale, John F']","['Kang EM', 'De Witte M', 'Malech H', 'Morgan RA', 'Carter C', 'Leitman SF', 'Childs R', 'Barrett AJ', 'Little R', 'Tisdale JF']","['Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Partially conflicting evidence about endothelial markers and their relationships with clinical complications after BMT has been reported in the literature. Since almost all studies were carried out in adults, we evaluated some recent available markers of endothelial cell function in pediatric patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT) for acute leukemia. PROCEDURE: We studied the variation in circulating serum endothelial-selectin (ES), leukocyte-selectin (LS), thrombomodulin (TM), von Willebrand factor (vWF), nitrate + nitrite (NO(2) (-)/NO(3) (-)), endothelin-1 (EN), and tissue factor (TF) in 21 pediatric patients undergoing SCT for acute leukemia. RESULTS: ES and LS significantly lowered following SCT and returned to pre-SCT levels 4 weeks after the procedure. NO(2) (-)/NO(3) (-) markedly increased following SCT. Also, TM and vWF increased, although such changes did not reach statistical significance. EN and TF did not appreciably change. A strong correlation was observed between white blood cell (WBC) count and both ES and LS, as well as between such selectins. TM significantly correlated with both selectins and NO(2) (-)/NO(3) (-). The pre-conditioning levels of TM and vWF in patients undergoing major complications, considered altogether, were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than in uncomplicated patients. NO(2) (-)/NO(3) (-) levels 3 and 4 weeks post-SCT were significantly lower in patients suffering from veno occlusive disease. Both selectins were significantly higher in allo- than in auto-transplanted patients 4 weeks after SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis of severe endothelial damage after conditioning and SCT, particularly allogeneic. However, the increase in TM, which has strong anticoagulant properties, and metabolites of NO, involved also in protective actions, may reflect regeneration of the anti-thrombotic endothelial function. This could take place after transitory functional impairment, rather than pure endothelial damage.","['Luzzatto, Guido', 'Cella, Giuseppe', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Randi, Maria Luigia', 'Sbarai, Alessandra', 'Zanesco, Luigi']","['Luzzatto G', 'Cella G', 'Messina C', 'Randi ML', 'Sbarai A', 'Zanesco L']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Science, Chair of Hematology, Padova University Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endothelin-1/blood', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Nitrates/blood', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitrites/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*therapy', 'Selectins/blood', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Thrombomodulin/blood', 'Time Factors', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",2002/11/12 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/12 04:00'],"['2002/11/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10145 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Jan;40(1):9-12. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10145.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Selectins)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated whether vitamin E and catechin can reduce the toxic effects of idarubicin. Vitamin E (200 IU kg(-1) week(-1)), catechin (200 mg kg(-1) week(-1)), idarubicin (5 mg kg(-1) week(-1)), idarubicin + vitamin E (200 IU kg(-1) week(-1)), and idarubicin + catechin (200 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) combinations were given to male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 210 to 230 g (N = 6/group). Idarubicin-treated animals exhibited a decrease in body and heart weight, a decrease in myocardial contractility, and changes in ECG parameters (P<0.01). Catechin + idarubicin- and vitamin E + idarubicin-treated groups exhibited similar alterations, but changes were attenuated in comparison to those in cardiac muscle of idarubicin-treated rats (P<0.05). Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was reduced in the idarubicin-treated group (P<0.05). Glutathione peroxidase levels were decreased in the idarubicin-treated group (P<0.05) and reached maximum concentrations in the catechin- and catechin + idarubicin-treated groups compared to control (P<0.01). Malondialdehyde activity was decreased in the catechin + idarubicin-treated groups compared to control and increased in the other groups, reaching maximum concentrations in the vitamin E-treated group (P<0.01). In electron microscopy studies, swelling of the mitochondria and dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myocytes were observed in the idarubicin-treated groups. In groups that were given idarubicin + vitamin E and idarubicin + catechin, the only morphological change was a weak dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The ca. 110-kb large hypervariable region located near the lipH gene in two members of the predominant P. aeruginosa clone C, strain C and strain SG17M, was sequenced. In both strains the region consists of an individual strain-specific gene island of 111 (strain C) or 106 (SG17M) open reading frames (ORFs) and of a 7-kb stretch of clone C-specific sequence of 9 ORFs. The gene islands are integrated into conserved tRNA(Gly) genes and have a bipartite structure. The first part adjacent to the tRNA gene consists of strain-specific ORFs encoding metabolic functions and transporters, the majority of which have homologs of known function in other eubacteria, such as hemophores, cytochrome c biosynthesis, or mercury resistance. The second part is made up mostly of ORFs of yet-unknown function. Forty-seven of these ORFs are mutual homologs with a pairwise amino acid sequence identity of 35 to 88% and are arranged in the same order in the two gene islands. We hypothesize that this novel type of gene island derives from mobile elements which, upon integration, endow the recipient with strain-specific metabolic properties, thus possibly conferring on it a selective advantage in its specific habitat.","['Larbig, Karen D', 'Christmann, Andreas', 'Johann, Andre', 'Klockgether, Jens', 'Hartsch, Thomas', 'Merkl, Rainer', 'Wiehlmann, Lutz', 'Fritz, Hans-Joachim', 'Tummler, Burkhard']","['Larbig KD', 'Christmann A', 'Johann A', 'Klockgether J', 'Hartsch T', 'Merkl R', 'Wiehlmann L', 'Fritz HJ', 'Tummler B']","['Klinische Forschergruppe, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bacteriol,Journal of bacteriology,2985120R,IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Codon', 'Cosmids/genetics', 'Cystic Fibrosis/microbiology', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', '*Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity']",2002/11/12 04:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/11/12 04:00'],"['2002/11/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JB.184.23.6665-6680.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6665-80. doi: 10.1128/JB.184.23.6665-6680.2002.,,,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)']",,,,,,PMC135438,,"['GENBANK/AF440523', 'GENBANK/AF440524']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Primary leukemia cells were isolated form the bone marrow of 49 patients with leukemia, and the expression of SCF mRNA determined by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among the 19 patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), 5 were positive and 14 negative for SCF mRNA. In cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=30), 24 of M1 to M4 subtypes were found positive for SCF mRNA but 4 of M5 subtype and 2 of M6 subtype were negative. There was a significant difference between ALL and AML groups (P<0.05). Eight (27.6%) cases were refractory leukemia in the total of 29 patients who were positive for SCF, while 12 (60.0%) were refractory among the 20 patients negative for SCF (P<0.05).

Here we demonstrate that the production of the interleukins 6, 10, and 15 (IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15) are diminished in c-Rel(-/-) B lymphocytes. In a manner similar to that seen in IL-6(-/-) B cells, resultant STAT activation is reduced in c-Rel(-/-) B cells following B cell receptor (BCR) ligation. Addition of either exogenous IL-6 or IL-10, but not IL-15, partially restores proliferation, and this occurs through enhanced cell survival rather than promoting cell cycle progression. This increase in viability occurs independently of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression though, two survival genes reported to be downstream of IL-6 signaling. Nonetheless, transgenically expressed Bcl-xL, a direct c-Rel target gene in B cells, corrects not only the survival defect of c-Rel deficiency, but also partially ameliorates hypoproliferation. Together IL-6 and Bcl-xL are additive but incomplete in the restoration of proliferation. Known deficits in the induction of several key cell cycle components in c-Rel(-/-)B cells are not corrected upon treatment with exogenous cytokine. Together, these data demonstrate that IL-6 enhances B cell responses by employing multiple survival factors.","['Tumang, Joseph R', 'Hsia, Constance Y', 'Tian, Wenzhi', 'Bromberg, Jacqueline F', 'Liou, Hsiou-Chi']","['Tumang JR', 'Hsia CY', 'Tian W', 'Bromberg JF', 'Liou HC']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Immunological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/11/12 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/11/12 04:00'],"['2002/11/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0008874902005130 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-8749(02)00513-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2002 May-Jun;217(1-2):47-57. doi: 10.1016/s0008-8749(02)00513-0.,,,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,"['CA68155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07621/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine 759 of gp130 is required for the negative regulation of LIF-mediated signaling by both the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). We find that SOCS-3 is expressed in the neuronal cell lines SN56 and IMR32 and negatively regulates LIF-stimulated neuronal gene expression. Studies using antisense oligonucleotides targeted to SHP-2 or SOCS-3 indicate that either protein can negatively regulate LIF-stimulated neuronal gene expression independently of the other. Mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 demonstrates that the four signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) binding sites within gp130 are necessary for the induction of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) reporter genes, with the sites surrounding tyrosines 905 and 915 (Y905 and Y915) being most important in gp130-mediated reporter gene expression. While there are four STAT binding sites within gp130, only those surrounding Y905 and Y915 can mediate STAT1 activation; these results indicate that STAT1 may be essential for normal gp130-stimulated VIP and ChAT expression. Additionally, the negative regulation of signaling mediated by Y759 of gp130 is dependent upon intact STAT sites within the receptor. This indicates that STAT signaling is necessary for LIF- and CNTF-stimulated VIP and ChAT expression and Y759 of gp130 mediates the activities of SHP-2 and SOCS-3, which act to negatively regulate STAT activity.","['Bartoe, Joseph L', 'Nathanson, Neil M']","['Bartoe JL', 'Nathanson NM']","['University of Washington, Department of Pharmacology, Box 357750, Seattle, WA 98195-7750, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Mol Brain Res,Brain research.

During this study, possible immune suppressive effects of ALV-J were assessed by measuring delayed-type hypersensitivity with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), natural killer (NK) cell activity, the production of radicals of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages, humoral immune response against Newcastle and infectious bursal disease vaccine viruses, and automated total and differential leukocyte counts. In an attempt to elucidate the underlying causal mechanisms of the induced growth retardation, 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in serum were measured. Four experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, ALV-J-injected birds were compared with ALV subgroup A (ALV-A)-injected and negative control chickens. In experiment 2, ALV-J-injected birds were only compared with negative controls. Finally, in experiments 3a and 3b, ALV-J-injected chickens were compared with negative controls and a group of chickens in which only 10% of birds had been injected with ALV-J. Birds were injected in ovo at day 7 of incubation with 10(4) median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) ALV-J or ALV-A, except in experiment 3a where 10(2) TCID(50) ALV-J was injected. Significant growth suppression was found in all 100% of ALV-J-infected groups. The average growth retardation of ALV-J-infected birds compared with negative controls at 6 weeks of age was approximately 8, 11, 2.5 and 6% for the four successive experiments performed. The delayed-type hypersensitivity test against KLH of ALV-J-infected birds showed a tendency towards lower wattle thickness; however, the difference with controls was not significant (P > 0.05). The same was true for NK cell activity and NO production by macrophages, although the difference was not significant. The total and differential leukocyte counts performed on blood samples from birds at 3, 4 and 6 weeks of age as well as the humoral immune response against Newcastle and infectious bursal disease vaccine viruses did not show significant differences between treatment groups either. Only the number of basophils were significantly higher (P = 0.02) in ALV-J-infected birds at 3 weeks of age. No significant lower T(3) levels were found in ALV-J-infected birds in weeks 2 and 3 (experiment 2) and weeks 3 and 5 (experiment 3b); however, at 4 weeks (experiment 2) and 6 weeks (experiment 3b) of age, T(3) levels were significantly lower suggesting mild hypothyroidism in these broilers. In conclusion, the present experiments show the occurrence of significant growth retardation in SPF broilers after an ALV-J in ovo infection. The various studies performed to assess the immune competence of ALV-J-infected chickens did not show significant differences in immune responsiveness. The assays on cellular immunity showed a tendency to a lower response in ALV-J-infected birds, but these differences were not statistically significant.","['Landman, W J M', 'Post, J', 'Boonstra-Blom, A G', 'Buyse, J', 'Elbers, A R W', 'Koch, G']","['Landman WJ', 'Post J', 'Boonstra-Blom AG', 'Buyse J', 'Elbers AR', 'Koch G']","['Animal Health Service, Poultry Health Centre, Deventer, The Netherlands. w.landman@gdvdieren.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Body Weight', 'Chickens/*growth & development/*immunology/virology', 'Cloaca/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Netherlands', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Ovum/*virology', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/mortality/pathology/virology', '*Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Triiodothyronine, Reverse/blood']",2002/11/12 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/12 04:00'],"['2002/11/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03079450120106633 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2002 Feb;31(1):59-72. doi: 10.1080/03079450120106633.,,,"['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '5817-39-0 (Triiodothyronine, Reverse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the 1960s, patients admitted to our medical center with advanced Hodgkin's disease, hairy cell leukemia, and the acute leukemias had a life expectancy of < 1 year. Today, even advanced Hodgkin's disease and hairy cell leukemia are curable, and many patients with other acute leukemias respond to therapy and have very durable remissions. The rate of maternal mortality has shown a dramatic decline, and many childhood diseases have been eradicated or reduced to infrequent occurrences.

The mechanisms by which morphine enhances HIV infection of human immune cells are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to determine the possible mechanisms by which morphine upregulates HIV infection of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). METHODS: In this study, MDM were infected with the R5, X4, and R5X4 HIV strains. HIV replication was determined by performing reverse transcriptase activity assays. HIV receptors were determined by performing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions and flow cytometry assays. beta-chemokines were analyzed by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, HIV R5 strain and murine leukemia virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was performed to determine whether morphine affects HIV infection of macrophages at entry level. RESULTS: Morphine significantly enhanced HIV R5 strain infection of MDM but had little effect on X4 strain infection. The macrophage-tropic R5 strain envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was markedly increased by morphine, whereas murine leukemia virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was not significantly affected. Furthermore, morphine significantly upregulated CCR5 receptor expression and inhibited the endogenous production of beta-chemokines in MDM. The opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone blocked the effects of morphine on the production of beta-chemokines. CONCLUSION: Opiates enhance HIV R5 strain infection of macrophages through the downregulation of beta-chemokine production and upregulation of CCR5 receptor expression and may have an important role in HIV immunopathogenesis.","['Guo, Chang-Jiang', 'Li, Yuan', 'Tian, Sha', 'Wang, Xu', 'Douglas, Steven D', 'Ho, Wen-Zhe']","['Guo CJ', 'Li Y', 'Tian S', 'Wang X', 'Douglas SD', 'Ho WZ']","[""Division of Immunologic and Infectious Diseases, Joseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,IM,"['Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV/classification/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Morphine/*pharmacology', 'Naltrexone/pharmacology', 'Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Narcotics/*pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Receptors, CCR5/*biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2002/11/12 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/11/12 04:00'],"['2002/11/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jim-50-06-03 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med. 2002 Nov;50(6):435-42. doi: 10.1136/jim-50-06-03.,,,"['0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Narcotic Antagonists)', '0 (Narcotics)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '5S6W795CQM (Naltrexone)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",,,"['R01 DA012815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH049981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 12815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 49981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4037869,,,['NIHMS575122'],,,,,,,,10.1136/jim-50-06-03 [doi]

The commonest risk groups are children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukaemia, corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, chronic granulomatous disease and severe combined immunodeficiency as well as neonates. The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and many organ systems can be involved. Diagnosis based on the clinical presentation alone is cumbersome. Innovative and sensitive laboratory test systems which detect fungal antigens or DNA in clinical specimens have been recently developed. Specific Aspergillus antibody detection using recombinant antigen technique has also been introduced. Although each individual technique has drawbacks, the combined use of culture with antigen and antibody ELISA as well as PCR should result in an earlier and more definitive diagnosis of IA in children presenting with clinical and/or radiological signs of aspergillosis. In high risk children these methods are valuable for serial screening and early detection of Aspergillus infection. The implementation of accurate diagnostic criteria and standardised diagnostic flow charts in children at risk will lead to a better outcome of IA in the future. CONCLUSION: definite, well-timed early diagnosis and sufficient therapy is elementary for a successful outcome of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children. To date, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains a combination of clinical presentation, radiology and microbiological tests.","['Muller, Frank-Michael C', 'Trusen, Andreas', 'Weig, Michael']","['Muller FM', 'Trusen A', 'Weig M']","['Department of Paediatrics and Institute for Molecular Biology of Infection, University of Wurzburg, Germany.

Furthermore, mRNA of the WT1 gene located at chromosome 11p13 was overexpressed during leukemic transformation, whereas it was not detected at the time of the initial diagnosis of MDS (RAEB) in May 1998. It was thought that this chromosome deletion and overexpression of WT1 resulted in the leukemic transformation in this patient. This is the first case report of del11(p11-13) being considered to be the primary cause of leukemic transformation from MDS.","['Suzuki, S', 'Hashino, S', 'Yoshida, S', 'Chiba, K', 'Izumiyama, K', 'Kurosawa, M', 'Musashi, M', 'Asaka, M']","['Suzuki S', 'Hashino S', 'Yoshida S', 'Chiba K', 'Izumiyama K', 'Kurosawa M', 'Musashi M', 'Asaka M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University, School of Medicine, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan. sa-suzuki@h2.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2002/11/09 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0531-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Oct;81(10):605-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0531-y.

Results of a single-center study of 24 patients.,582-7,"To investigate the problem of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) for advanced stage patients, we retrospectively analyzed 24 consecutive patients who underwent allo-BMT in the non-remission stage. Twenty-four patients (19 males and 5 females) with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and malignant lymphoma underwent allo-BMT. The patients had a median age of 30 years. There were eight cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six cases acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), nine cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and one case of Burkitt's lymphoma. The 3-year overall survival rate was 22.5%, with a median survival time of 206 days in AML, 345 days in ALL, and 363 days in CML. Overall survival was associated with a recovery of platelets of less than 30 days and an acute graft-versus-host disease (acute GVHD) presence of less than grade II ( p=0.042). Fourteen patients died of transplantation-related diseases. Our important problem is to decrease transplantation-related deaths in allo-BMT during the non-remission stage, and longer survival can be expected with better pretreatment and prophylaxis for GVHD. In addition, the selection of the source of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at an optimal time is considered to be another problem to be approached.","['Tabata, M', 'Satake, A', 'Okura, N', 'Yamazaki, Y', 'Toda, A', 'Nishioka, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'Chin, M', 'Itsukuma, T', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Misawa, M', 'Kai, S', 'Hara, H']","['Tabata M', 'Satake A', 'Okura N', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Toda A', 'Nishioka K', 'Tanaka H', 'Chin M', 'Itsukuma T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Misawa M', 'Kai S', 'Hara H']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Mukogawa-cho 1-1, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8501, Japan. mtabata@mtf.biglobe.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Cause of Death', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/mortality', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/09 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0506-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Oct;81(10):582-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0506-z.

However, the optimal timing of G-CSF administration after chemotherapy is not known. In a prospective randomized multi-center study, adult ALL patients were treated with high-dose ARA-C [HDAC, 3 g/m(2) bid (1 g/m(2) bid for T-ALL) days 1-4] and mitoxantrone (MI 10 mg/m(2) days 3-5). They were randomized to receive recombinant human G-CSF (Lenograstim) 263 micro g/day SC starting either from day 12 (Group 1) or day 17 (Group 2). Fifty-five patients (41 male, 14 female) with a median age of 34 years (range: 18-55 years) were enrolled into the study; 50 patients were evaluable. The median duration of neutropenia <500/ micro l after HDAC/MI was 12 days (range: 7-22 days) in the early G-CSF Group 1 and also 12 days (range: 4-22 days) in the late G-CSF Group 2; this was shorter than in the historical control group (15 days, range: 4-43 days, n=46) where the patients received identical cytotoxic treatment without G-CSF. Seventeen infections were observed in 14 patients in Group 1 (47%) and 13 infections in 10 patients in Group 2 (50%) compared to 27 infections in 49 patients of the historical control (54%). In Group 1, the patients received a median of 11 injections with G-CSF (range: 7-22) compared to 7 injections (range: 4-19) in Group 2. The total administered dose of G-CSF in Group 2 was significantly reduced by 40% ( P<0.0001). The delayed start of G-CSF after HDAC/MI in ALL achieves the same clinical benefit compared to the earlier initiation of G-CSF. The reduction of treatment costs by reducing the total G-CSF dose may be important in future treatment with this hematopoietic growth factor.","['Hofmann, W K', 'Seipelt, G', 'Langenhan, S', 'Reutzel, R', 'Schott, D', 'Schoeffski, O', 'Illiger, H J', 'Hartmann, F', 'Balleisen, L', 'Franke, A', 'Fiedler, F', 'Huber, C', 'Rasche, H', 'Bergmann, L', 'Ganser, A', 'Pott, C', 'Pasold, R', 'Rudolph, C', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Hofmann WK', 'Seipelt G', 'Langenhan S', 'Reutzel R', 'Schott D', 'Schoeffski O', 'Illiger HJ', 'Hartmann F', 'Balleisen L', 'Franke A', 'Fiedler F', 'Huber C', 'Rasche H', 'Bergmann L', 'Ganser A', 'Pott C', 'Pasold R', 'Rudolph C', 'Ottmann OG', 'Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Serum and tissue lycopene levels have also been inversely related to the risk of lung and prostate cancers. Lycopene functions as a very potent antioxidant, and this is clearly a major important mechanism of lycopene action. In this regard, lycopene can trap singlet oxygen and reduce mutagenesis in the Ames test. However, evidence is accumulating for other mechanisms as well. Lycopene at physiological concentrations can inhibit human cancer cell growth by interfering with growth factor receptor signaling and cell cycle progression specifically in prostate cancer cells without evidence of toxic effects or apoptosis of cells. Studies using human and animal cells have identified a gene, connexin 43, whose expression is upregulated by lycopene and which allows direct intercellular gap junctional communication (GJC). GJC is deficient in many human tumors and its restoration or upregulation is associated with decreased proliferation. The combination of low concentrations of lycopene with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exhibits a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and differentiation and an additive effect on cell cycle progression in the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line, suggesting some interaction at a nuclear or subcellular level. The combination of lycopene and lutein synergistically interact as antioxidants, and this may relate to specific positioning of different carotenoids in membranes. This review will focus on the growing body of evidence that carotenoids have unexpected biologic effects in experimental systems, some of which may contribute to their cancer preventive properties in models of carcinogenesis. Consideration of solubility in vitro, comparison with doses achieved in humans by dietary means, interactions with other phytochemicals, and other potential mechanisms such as stimulation of xenobiotic metabolism, inhibition of cholesterogenesis, modulation of cyclooxygenase pathways, and inhibition of inflammation will be considered. This review will point out areas for future research where more evidence is needed on the effects of lycopene on the etiology of chronic disease.","['Heber, David', 'Lu, Qing-Yi']","['Heber D', 'Lu QY']","['University of California Center for Human Nutrition, 900 Veteran Avenue, Room 1-2-213, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1742, USA. dheber@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carotenoids/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Lycopene', 'Lycopersicon esculentum/chemistry', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Xenobiotics/metabolism']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/153537020222701013 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2002 Nov;227(10):920-3. doi: 10.1177/153537020222701013.,22,,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease in which tumor antigens are expressed by the malignant clone that also has the potential to differentiate into DC-like cells (leukemic DCs) with antigen-presenting capacity. This study investigated whether the constitutive expression of the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) in primary AML cells during their differentiation toward leukemic DCs results in superior antigen-presenting cells. A bicistronic retroviral vector encoding the IL-7 cytokine and the surface immunoselectable low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFr) gene was constructed and used for transduction experiments. A serum-free system was used to transduce and differentiate leukemic cells toward leukemic DCs. The study included 8 patients with AML. The transduction efficiency with the cytokine vector varied among patients, ranging from 5% to 30% as judged by LNGFr expression. The leukemic origin of the transduced cells was confirmed in a patient with a chromosomal translocation t(9:11) by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Cytokine modified-cells consistently secreted IL-7 (mean, 415 pg +/- 190/10(6) cells/48 hours; n = 5). We demonstrate that IL-7-transduced cells are included in the differentiated leukemic DC subset, and, as shown in a particular case, that about half of the mature CD80(+) and CD83(+) populations coexpress the LNGFr transgene. In addition, IL-7-modified leukemic cells induce stronger allo-T-cell stimulation and higher amounts of IL-2 production in T cells compared with control groups. Finally, cytokine-transduced leukemic DCs can effectively prime and generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes against autologous leukemic blasts.","['Bello-Fernandez, Concha', 'Stasakova, Jana', 'Renner, Alexander', 'Carballido-Perrig, Nicole', 'Koening, Margit', 'Waclavicek, Martina', 'Madjic, Otto', 'Oehler, Leopold', 'Haas, Oskar', 'Carballido, Jose M', 'Buschle, Michael', 'Knapp, Walter']","['Bello-Fernandez C', 'Stasakova J', 'Renner A', 'Carballido-Perrig N', 'Koening M', 'Waclavicek M', 'Madjic O', 'Oehler L', 'Haas O', 'Carballido JM', 'Buschle M', 'Knapp W']","['Institute of Immunology, Vienna International Research Cooperation Center (VIRCC), University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. concha@kabsi.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, CD', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Interleukin-7/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2002/11/09 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0378 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57330-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2184-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0378.

Bcl-2 and Bax oncoproteins were evaluated in 255 de novo AML patients (pts) by flow cytometry using an anti-bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and an anti-bax MoAb. The results were expressed as an index (bax/bcl-2) obtained by dividing bax mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and bcl-2 MFI. Lower bax/bcl-2 ratio was associated with French-American-British (FAB) M0-M1 classes (P =.000 01) and CD34 more than 20% (P <.000 01). There were striking inverse correlations between CD34 or CD117 MFI and bax/bcl-2 values (r = -.40, P <.000 001 and r = -.29, P =.000 002), confirming that immaturity is consistent with this index. Moreover, lower bax/bcl-2 levels were correlated with poor-risk cytogenetics (P =.0002). A significant higher complete remission (CR) rate was found in pts with higher bax/bcl-2 levels (79% versus 45%; P =.000 01). Also, both a longer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were observed in pts with higher bax/bcl-2 levels (P =.000 01 and =.019). Noteworthy, bax/bcl-2 levels accurately predicted the clinical response and outcome of pts with normal or unknown cytogenetics. Indeed, within this subset of 147 pts, higher bax/bcl-2 ratio was significantly associated both with a higher CR rate (86% versus 42%; P <.000 01) and a longer OS (P =.0016).

We used TNF(-/-) mice to study the specific role of TNF produced by donor T cells in a well-established parent-into-F1 hybrid model (C57BL/6J-->C3FeB6F1/J). Recipients of TNF(-/-) T cells developed significantly less morbidity and mortality from GVHD than recipients of wild-type (wt) T cells. Histology of GVHD target organs revealed significantly less damage in thymus, small bowel, and large bowel, but not in liver or skin tissues from recipients of TNF(-/-) T cells. Recipients of TNF(-/-) T cells which were also inoculated with leukemia cells at the time of BMT showed increased mortality from leukemia when compared with recipients of wt cells. We found that TNF(-/-) T cells do not have intrinsic defects in vitro or in vivo in proliferation, IFN-gamma production, or alloactivation. We could not detect TNF in the serum of our transplant recipients, suggesting that T cells contribute to GVHD and GVL via membrane-bound or locally released TNF.","['Schmaltz, Cornelius', 'Alpdogan, Onder', 'Muriglan, Stephanie J', 'Kappel, Barry J', 'Rotolo, Jimmy A', 'Ricchetti, Eric T', 'Greenberg, Andrew S', 'Willis, Lucy M', 'Murphy, George F', 'Crawford, James M', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M']","['Schmaltz C', 'Alpdogan O', 'Muriglan SJ', 'Kappel BJ', 'Rotolo JA', 'Ricchetti ET', 'Greenberg AS', 'Willis LM', 'Murphy GF', 'Crawford JM', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Intestine, Large/pathology', 'Intestine, Small/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/deficiency/*physiology']",2002/11/09 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2109 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57370-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2440-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2109.

To avoid high-dose conditioning and evaluate engraftment, toxicity, and GvT reactions, we treated a group of high-risk patients with a minimal intensive conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic BSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with lymphoma (11), myeloma (10), chronic myeloid leukemia (4), myelodysplastic syndrome (5), and acute myeloid leukemia (4) were treated with fludarabine (3 x 30 mg/m(2)) and 200 cGy total-body irradiation followed by the infusion of peripheral blood stem cells from related (28) or unrelated (6) donors. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetile were given posttransplant. Most patients had advanced disease, were intensively pretreated, and had contraindications against conventional myeloablative transplantation. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (94%) had engraftment of donor cells. Patients with lymphatic malignancies developed complete donor chimerism significantly faster than patients with myeloid malignancies (p < 0.05). Clinical responses were observed in 16 of 27 patients (59%) who had active disease at transplantation. Of 7 patients who were treated in remission, 5 remain free of disease. After a median follow-up of 325 days (range 100-844) 22 patients are alive (65%, 14 CR, 4 PR, 4 PD). Two patients (6%) died of treatment-related complications and 10 patients (29%) died of progressive disease. Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GvHD) of grade II or more developed in 17 patients (50%). Chronic GvHD is present in 10 of 22 patients (45%) who are alive beyond day 100. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity and survival in this group of high-risk patients are superior to those expected with conventional allogeneic transplantation. GvT reactions frequently occur in conjunction with GvHD and can induce durable remissions in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.","['Kobbe, Guido', 'Schneider, Peter', 'Aivado, Manuel', 'Zohren, Fabian', 'Schubert, Dominique', 'Fenk, Roland', 'Neumann, Frank', 'Kronenwett, Ralf', 'Pape, Hildegard', 'Rong, Astrid', 'Royer-Pokora, Brigitte', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Heyll, Axel', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Kobbe G', 'Schneider P', 'Aivado M', 'Zohren F', 'Schubert D', 'Fenk R', 'Neumann F', 'Kronenwett R', 'Pape H', 'Rong A', 'Royer-Pokora B', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Germing U', 'Gattermann N', 'Heyll A', 'Haas R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany. kobbe@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009232 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00923-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1346-53. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00923-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analyzed the sensitivity of patient leukemic progenitors to DTAT and correlated the sensitivity with CD87 expression. We isolated leukemic blasts by density gradient centrifugation and performed immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and blast sensitivity measurements by inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation in semisolid media. We found CD87 overexpression in 18 (25%) of 71 patient leukemic blast samples, including 18 (28%) of 64 myeloid malignancies and 0 (0%) of 7 lymphoid malignancies. DTAT was toxic to patient leukemic blasts by both proliferation inhibition (IC50 <or=1 nM DTAT in 18/69 evaluable samples) and colony formation inhibition (>85% inhibition by 10 nM DTAT in 11/41 evaluable samples). Only AML and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis blasts (18/61 [30%]) were sensitive to DTAT by the proliferation inhibition assay. Lymphoid leukemia and chronic phase CML/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) progenitors were insensitive to DTAT by the proliferation inhibition assay (n = 7 and n = 3, respectively). Similarly, normal marrow progenitors were insensitive to DTAT by both proliferation inhibition (n = 2) and colony inhibition (n = 5) assays. The DTAT toxicity measured by both proliferation inhibition assay and colony inhibition assay correlated with CD87 density (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively). DTAT toxicity results were similar for leukemic blasts measured by either of the two assays (p = 0.0002). This study provides the first evidence that a urokinase receptor targeted diphtheria fusion protein is toxic to patient AML blasts. The work also suggests that blast proliferation assays yield similar responses to leukemia colony-forming cell colony assays.","['Frankel, Arthur E', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Thorburn, Andrew', 'Chen, Yong Q', 'Vallera, Daniel A']","['Frankel AE', 'Beran M', 'Hogge DE', 'Powell BL', 'Thorburn A', 'Chen YQ', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. afrankel@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*pharmacology']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009256 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00925-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1316-23. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00925-6.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,"['R01CA076178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA090263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA90550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recently demonstrated that the coexpression of at least two proteins, including P glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-related protein, bcl-2 (flow cytometry), p53 (luminometric immunoassay), and heat shock protein 27 (Western blotting), was predictive for response to induction therapy in de novo AML comparing leukemic blasts of 20 responders with 20 nonresponders. After long-term follow-up, we now present our evaluation on the prognostic significance of these proteins in leukemic blasts of 124 untreated AML patients with regard to the probability of remission (PoR) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Analyzing leukemic blasts obtained from bone marrow samples, we found that no single protein significantly correlated with PoR or OS. In contrast, the coexpression of at least two of these proteins was predictive for reduced OS in univariate as well as multivariate analysis. Although we could not identify any particular protein combination predictive for reduced OS, those patients with no or only one protein expressed in their leukemic blasts had a survival probability of 48% in contrast to 24% in those patients with the coexpression of two or more proteins. Among the clinical markers, only response to chemotherapy had a significant effect on OS and age was of prognostic relevance for PoR. CONCLUSION: We conclude that overexpression of only one protein possibly involved in resistance, is not sufficient to influence the prognosis for long-term survival in AML, whereas the expression of more than one protein is predictive for reduced OS. Protein combination seems to be individually different, and targeting only one protein in further clinical trials may not help to overcome multifactorial resistance.","['Kasimir-Bauer, Sabine', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Flasshove, Michael', 'Noppeney, Richard', 'Seeber, Siegfried', 'Scheulen, Max Ernst']","['Kasimir-Bauer S', 'Beelen D', 'Flasshove M', 'Noppeney R', 'Seeber S', 'Scheulen ME']","['Departments of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), University of Essen, Medical School, West German Cancer Center, Essen, Germany. sabine.kasimir-bauer@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*physiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*physiology']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009268 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00926-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1302-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00926-8.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'AIDA protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukemia cell lines (K562, HL-60, KG1a, and Nalm-6), primary leukemic cells, and normal mononuclear cells are treated by ultrasound at a frequency of 1.8 MHz during various exposure times (acoustical power of 7 mW/mL) and immediately tested for cell viability by the trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis is evaluated by cell morphology, phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation. The mitochondrial potential, glutathione content, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and bcl-2/bax ratio are tested by flow cytometry. Cloning efficiency is evaluated by assays in methylcellulose. RESULTS: The technique we describe here, using minute amounts of energy and in the absence of any chemical synergy, specifically triggers apoptosis in leukemic cells while necrosis is significantly reduced. Ultrasonic treatment of 20 seconds' duration induces a series of successive phases showing the characteristic features of apoptosis: mitochondrial transmembrane potential disturbances, loss of phosphatidylserine asymmetry, morphological changes, and, finally, DNA fragmentation. In contrast to K562 cells, for which a significant reduction of cloning efficiency is observed, the growth of hematopoietic progenitors is totally unaffected. Ultrasound treatment is also associated with depletion of cellular glutathione content, suggesting a link with the oxidative stress. Moreover, the fact that active oxygen scavengers reduce ultrasonic-induced apoptosis suggests a sonochemical mechanism. CONCLUSION: The cell damage observed after exposure of leukemic cells to ultrasound is associated with the apoptotic process and may be a promising tool for a smooth, specific, and effective ex vivo purging of leukemic cells.","['Lagneaux, Laurence', 'de Meulenaer, Eric Cordemans', 'Delforge, Alain', 'Dejeneffe, Marielle', 'Massy, Martine', 'Moerman, Carine', 'Hannecart, Baudouin', 'Canivet, Yves', 'Lepeltier, Marie Francoise', 'Bron, Dominique']","['Lagneaux L', 'de Meulenaer EC', 'Delforge A', 'Dejeneffe M', 'Massy M', 'Moerman C', 'Hannecart B', 'Canivet Y', 'Lepeltier MF', 'Bron D']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. laurence.lagneaux@bordet.be""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analysis', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Histidine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Intracellular Membranes/diagnostic imaging', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mannitol/pharmacology', 'Membrane Lipids/analysis', 'Mitochondria/diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylserines/analysis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', '*Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009207 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00920-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1293-301. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00920-7.,,,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: CD40 was detected in blast cells from about 37% of AMLs, the highest frequency being documented in monocytic subtypes, and its expression was upregulated or de novo induced by treatment with interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-3, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Exposure of CD40(+) AML blasts to sCD40L resulted in a dose-dependent proliferative response, enhancement of clonogenic growth and self-renewal capacity, and a striking increase in colony size. CD40 engagement was able to rescue AML blasts from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, as demonstrated by reduced expression of APO2.7 and annexin-V binding, as well as upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-x(L). CD40 triggering upregulated cell surface expression of the adhesion molecules CD54, CD58, and CD15 and resulted in homotypic aggregation of leukemia cells at least in part CD54-dependent. An increased production of IL-6 and GM-CSF by CD40(+) AML blasts was also documented upon sCD40L exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a possible involvement of CD40 in the interactions of AML blasts with other growth-sustaining microenvironmental accessory cells and immune effectors, in turn expressing CD40L. Caution in the use of CD40 triggering in immunotherapy of AMLs is also suggested.","['Aldinucci, Donatella', 'Poletto, Dalisa', 'Nanni, Paola', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Rupolo, Maurizio', 'Pinto, Antonio', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Aldinucci D', 'Poletto D', 'Nanni P', 'Degan M', 'Rupolo M', 'Pinto A', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Hematology Research Unit, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy. daldinucci@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD40 Antigens/analysis/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009219 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00921-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1283-92. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00921-9.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracycline agents or cytosine arabinoside (AraC), are generally co-administered with ATRA. The therapeutic outcome of APL patients has significantly improved by chemo-differentiation therapy. Late-phase toxicities, such as cardiotoxicity and secondary carcinogenesis, are becoming clinically important. Therefore, we must identify the most suitable chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of APL. METHODS: We examined the effects of ICRF-193 and several other anticancer drugs on the growth and differentiation of APL cell lines (NB4 and HT-93) and other myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and U937). RESULTS: If anticancer agents were available that not only inhibited the proliferation of APL cells but also induced their differentiation, they would be very useful for the treatment of APL. DNR slightly induced the differentiation of APL cells. On the other hand, other DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as ICRF-154 and ICRF-193, significantly induced the differentiation of APL cell lines and leukemia cells freshly isolated from APL patients. These drugs effectively cooperated with ATRA in inhibiting the growth and inducing the differentiation of APL cells, whereas DNR did not. The incidence of cardiotoxicity and secondary carcinogenesis associated with ICRF-193 are much lower than that with DNR. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ICRF-193 may be useful in the treatment of patients with APL.","['Niitsu, Nozomi', 'Higashihara, Masaaki', 'Honma, Yoshio']","['Niitsu N', 'Higashihara M', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine IV, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. nniitsu@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catalysis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'U937 Cells/cytology/drug effects']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009050 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00905-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Nov;30(11):1273-82. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00905-0.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', ""FLT15E4X9N (2'-deoxy-2'-methylenecytidine)"", 'QML51S42CD (1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)ethane)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the extent to which hematopoiesis is dependent upon activation of a particular gp130 signaling pathway, namely STAT1/3 or SHP2/MAPK, is unknown. This study examined the specific contribution of gp130-mediated STAT1/3 signaling to the regulation of hematopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hematopoiesis was examined at various developmental stages in mice homozygous for a targeted carboxy-terminal truncation mutation in gp130 (gp130(delta)/(delta)) that deletes all STAT1/3 binding sites, thereby abolishing gp130-mediated STAT1/3 activation. RESULTS: Adult gp130(delta)/(delta) mice have increased numbers of immature colony-forming unit spleen progenitor cells in the bone marrow and spleen, elevated numbers of committed myeloid progenitor cells in the spleen and peripheral blood, and leukocytosis. Increased progenitor cell production was observed in gp130(delta)/(delta) fetal livers from 14 days of gestation onward. In contrast, the circulating platelet count was reduced by 30% in gp130(delta)/(delta) mice, without any corresponding decrease in the number of bone marrow and splenic megakaryocytes. In liquid cultures, megakaryocytes from gp130(delta)/(delta) mice are smaller than those from wild-type mice and do not increase in size upon stimulation with interleukin-6 or interleukin-11. Administration of either interleukin-6 or interleukin-11 to gp130(delta)/(delta) mice failed to increase platelet numbers, despite an increase in the production of megakaryocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results reveal that gp130-mediated STAT1/3 activation is required to maintain the normal balance of hematopoietic progenitors during fetal and adult hematopoiesis. Furthermore, they suggest two distinct roles for gp130-mediated STAT1/3 activation in hematopoiesis, one restricting the production of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells and the other promoting the functional maturation of megakaryocytes to produce platelets.","['Jenkins, Brendan J', 'Quilici, Cathy', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Grail, Dianne', 'Dunn, Ashley R', 'Ernst, Matthias']","['Jenkins BJ', 'Quilici C', 'Roberts AW', 'Grail D', 'Dunn AR', 'Ernst M']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Molecular Biology Laboratory, Victoria, Australia.

Considering that introduction of a chromosome 7 into a cancer cell line had been reported to eliminate telomerase activity, that 7q- is a common negative prognostic finding in cancers, and that the deleted segment (band 7q31) contains an unidentified tumor suppressor gene, we wondered if this gene might be a telomerase inhibitor. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in telomerase activity between the three groups of patient samples. In contrast to reports on tumor cell lines we observed no amplification of the telomerase genes. METHODS: We analyzed telomerase activity and copy number of the telomerase genes hTERT and hTR in frozen archival bone marrow samples from leukemia patients with a referral diagnosis of AML, and either a monosomy for chromosome 7, a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q-), or none of these aberrations. Telomerase activity was measured with a commercially available kit, and the copy number of the telomerase genes was tested by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a telomerase inhibitor in band 7q31. The lack of telomerase gene amplification found in cell lines from solid tumors could reflect that this amplification is a property of solid tumors, not of hematological cancers.","['Serakinci, Nedime', 'Koch, Jorn E']","['Serakinci N', 'Koch JE']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Aarhus, Aarhus C, Denmark. nedi@humgen.au.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,,,2002/11/09 04:00,2002/11/09 04:01,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/09 04:01 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2350-3-11 [doi]'],epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2002 Oct 29;3:11. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-3-11.,,,,,,,20021029,,PMC137583,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: VEGF mRNA expression was present in most of the AML cell lines HL-60, K562 and Raji, but not in Jurkat cells. The expression rate of VEGF mRNA in the bone marrow cells from AML patients (82%) was higher than the rates in normal subjects (30.76%) and AML patients with autologous bone marrow transplantation (41.67%). Refractory and non-refractory AML patients had higher mean plasma VEGF levels than the normal donors and AML patients with transplantation did, without significant differences observed in the latter 2 groups. With also significant difference between them, refractory and non-refractory AML groups had respectively 11.0 and 7.3-fold higher VEGF levels in the culture supernatant than the normal donor group did.

This method could be applied in the field of pharmacovigilance in order to investigate the potential relationship between drug exposure and the occurrence of an adverse event. It consists of the calculation of an expected number of events obtained by multiplying the exposed population by the event rate in the reference population. The comparison is made by means of a standardised mortality or incidence ratio (SMR or SIR). Three examples of this method are presented. The first example concerns central nervous system demyelinating disorders and hepatitis B vaccine, where the SIR calculated from spontaneous reports was equal to 1.05 (95% CI [0.82-1.26]). In the second example, the SMR of cardiovascular deaths related to sildenafil was significantly different from 1 (0.69, [0.43-1.08]) using data from prescription-event monitoring. In the last example, a strong association between acute leukaemia and chemotherapy in breast cancer was found (SIR 28.5, [12.3-56.2]) using exhaustive data from cancer registries. This method allows a quick and cheap risk assessment, although the quality of available data may limit validity of results. In this case, the hypothesis need to be examined by further ad-hoc clinical and pharmacoepidemiological studies.","['Oscar, M A', 'Lapeyre-Mestre, M']","['Oscar MA', 'Lapeyre-Mestre M']","[""Service de Pharmacologie Clinique, Centre Midi-Pyrenees Pharmacovigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Information sur le Medicament, Toulouse, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Therapie,Therapie,0420544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/adverse effects', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Purines', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Sildenafil Citrate', 'Sulfones']",2002/11/09 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/11/09 04:00'],"['2002/11/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Therapie. 2002 Jul-Aug;57(4):402-6.,,Evaluation du risque medicamenteux par la methode attendu/observe: definition et utilisation en pharmacovigilance.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sulfones)', 'BW9B0ZE037 (Sildenafil Citrate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aspects should be taken into account when modifying the protocol (lower dosage, withdrawal of some associations etc).

In this study, we show that inoculation of mice with apoptotic HIV-1/murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-infected cells induces HIV-1-specific immunity. Immunization with apoptotic HIV-1/MuLV-infected syngeneic splenocytes resulted in strong Nef-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation and p24-induced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation as well as IFN-gamma production. In addition, systemic IgG and IgA as well as mucosa-associated IgA responses were generated. Moreover, mice vaccinated with apoptotic HIV-1/MuLV cells were protected against challenge with live HIV-1/MuLV-infected cells, whereas mice vaccinated with apoptotic noninfected or MuLV-infected splenocytes remained susceptible to HIV-1/MuLV. These data show that i.p. immunization with apoptotic HIV-1-infected cells induces high levels of HIV-1-specific systemic immunity, primes for mucosal immunity, and induces protection against challenge with live HIV-1-infected cells in mice.

The disease is characterized by interactions between B cells and CD4(+) T cells resulting in polyclonal activation of both cell types. It is known that BM5def is expressed at highest levels in B cells and that B cells serve as viral APC. The CD19-CD21 complex and CD22 on the surface of B cells play critical roles as regulators of B cell responses to a variety of stimuli, influencing cell activation, differentiation, and survival. CD19 integrates positive signals induced by B cell receptor ligation by interacting with the protooncogene Vav, which leads to subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule. In contrast, CD22 negatively regulates Vav phosphorylation. To analyze the role of CD19, CD21, Vav, and CD22 in MAIDS, we infected mice deficient in CD19, CD21 (CR2), Vav-1, or CD22 with LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses. Infected CR2(-/-) mice developed MAIDS with a time course and severity indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice. In contrast, CD19 as well as Vav-1 deficiency restricted viral replication and suppressed the development of typical signs of MAIDS including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Finally, CD22 deficiency was found to accelerate MAIDS development. These results provide novel insights into the B cell signaling pathways required for normal induction and progression of MAIDS.","['Knoetig, Sonja M', 'Torrey, Ted A', 'Naghashfar, Zohreh', 'McCarty, Tom', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd']","['Knoetig SM', 'Torrey TA', 'Naghashfar Z', 'McCarty T', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 5640 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Antiviral Agents/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Disease Progression', 'Immune Sera/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin E/biosynthesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins/deficiency/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/deficiency/genetics', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Virus Integration/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/immunology']",2002/11/08 04:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/11/08 04:00'],"['2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.10.5607 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Nov 15;169(10):5607-14. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.10.5607.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is conceivable, therefore, that such proteins could function as an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. To comprehensively study protein-protein interactions between large KIAA proteins, we have constructed a library composed of 1087 KIAA cDNA clones based on prior functional classifications done in silico. We were guided by two principles that raise the success rate for detecting interactions per tested combination: we avoided testing low-probability combinations, and reduced the number of potential false negatives that arise from the fact that large proteins cannot reliably be expressed in yeast. The latter was addressed by constructing a cDNA library comprised of random fragments encoding large proteins. Cytoplasmic domains of KIAA transmembrane proteins (>1000 amino acids) were used as bait for yeast two-hybrid screening. Our analyses reveal that several KIAA proteins bearing a transmembrane region have the capability of binding to other KIAA proteins containing domains (e.g., PDZ, SH3, rhoGEF, and spectrin) known to be localized to highly specialized submembranous sites, indicating that they participate in cellular junction formation, receptor or channel clustering, and intracellular signaling events.

Since HML-2 cells proliferate exponentially in the presence of SCF and GM-CSF together, we analyzed the molecular mechanism of the interaction between these two factors in the cells. An immediate-early gene product, c-myc, was additively upregulated in HML-2 cells by addition of a combination of SCF and GM-CSF. c-myc antisense oligonucleotides effectively suppressed cell proliferation and downregulated the induction of D3, E, A, and B cyclins in HML-2 cells stimulated with the two-factor combination. HML-2 cells arrested at the G0/G1 phase with SCF alone and expressed modest amounts of c-myc and cyclin D3, but not cyclin E. With GM-CSF treatment alone, the cells could not progress to the G2/M phase and expressed c-myc, cyclin D3 and cyclin E but not cyclins A or B. The addition of the counterpart cytokine resulted in cell cycle completion by induction of the deficient cyclins. Taken together, it appears that the induction of c-myc is an indispensable event in the proliferation of HML-2 cells and that the cytokines SCF and GM-CSF interact reciprocally for expression of all cyclins required for cell cycle progression.","['Kamijo, Takehiko', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Takeuchi, Koichi', 'Ishii, Eizaburo', 'Komiyama, Atsushi']","['Kamijo T', 'Koike K', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Takeuchi K', 'Ishii E', 'Komiyama A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano 390-8621, Japan. tkamijo@hsp.md.shinshu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/08 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2002/11/08 04:00'],"['2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1043466602919666 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.2002.1966 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2002 Sep 21;19(6):267-75. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2002.1966.,,,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: S-bromodeoxyuridine-SCD and karyotyping studies were performed in 50 cases with clinically suspected MDS. RESULTS: Prolonged cell cycle time (CT) was found in 33 of the 50 cases (66.0%). In 13 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), all had prolonged CT. However, only 2 (10.5%) of the 19 cases with nonmalignant hematological disorders had prolonged CT. There were significant differences of CT between the cases with MDS and those with AML, aplastic anemia (AA) and benign hypercellular anemias as well as healthy individuals. However, there were no significant differences between healthy individuals and cases with AA and, with benign hepercellular anemia. CT gradually prolonged during the evolution of MDS. 24 of the 50 patients (48.0%) were found to have clonal chromosomal abnormalities. In seven cases not compatible with MDS according to FAB criteria, six were found to have clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The mortality rates were 11.8 and 50.0% in the groups of normal SCD and of prolonged SCD, respectively (P < 0.05). The rates of leukemia transformation in both the groups were 5.9% and 16.7% (P > 0.05). The median survival of both the groups was 12 months and 8 months (P = 0.051).

METHODS: The effect of As2S2 on proliferation of K562 cells was determined by counting the number of cells. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation analysis, and morphology observation. Expression of protein was determined by Western blot. RT-PCR was used to evaluate changes in gene expression. RESULTS: As2S2 greatly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of K562 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner at the concentration range of 1-5 micromol/L during 24-72 h. Viable cells were decreased to approximately 71 % of control at the concentration of 5 micromol/L after 48-h incubation, 31.4 % after 72-h incubation, and 45.4 % at 3 micromol/L after 72-h incubation. At 3 micromol/L for 72 h, 5 micromol/L for 48 h, and 5 micromol/L for 72 h, the apoptosis rate were 34.4 %, 21.8 %, and 46 % of the treated-cells, respectively. As2S2 decreased the Bcr-Abl fusion protein and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity of c-abl and Bcr-Abl, but it did not change the transcription of bcr-abl assayed. As2S2 also induced apoptosis in fresh mononuclear cells derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. CML Ph+ leukemia cells were more sensitive to the apoptotic effect of As2S2 than Ph- mononuclear cells (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: As2S2 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 and fresh CML mononuclear cells. The decline of the Bcr-Abl protein and its PTK activity may play an important role in the apoptotic effect of As2S2. As2S2 may be a useful agent for the treatment of CML.","['Li, Jun-E', 'Wu, Wei-Li', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Sun, Guan-Lin']","['Li JE', 'Wu WL', 'Wang ZY', 'Sun GL']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology']",2002/11/08 04:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2002/11/08 04:00'],"['2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2002 Nov;23(11):991-6.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfides)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The measurements were done using a noninvasive fluorescent spectroscopy in situ and in real time. The experiments were performed on three groups of animals with calcein as a soluble pH-insensitive fluorescent dye combined or not with glucose. Glucose solution was injected 5 or 30 min before calcein. Fluorescence emission intensity was recorded on normal and tumor tissues with an optical multichannel analyzer. Calcein concentration was also measured in blood using repetitive blood sampling. In the control group (without glucose injection), calcein is rapidly cleared from the blood, with a slow tissue clearance. Fluorescence of normal tissue was higher than fluorescence measured in tumor tissue. When glucose is injected 5 min before calcein, there was a rapid increase of tissue fluorescence followed by a plateau remaining during the whole experiment. No difference between tumor and normal tissue fluorescence intensity was observed. When glucose was injected 30 min before calcein, the plateau phase was reduced to 50 min in normal tissue. Tumor tissue fluorescence displays no distinct plateau phase. These results clearly showed the effect of glucose injection in situ and in real time, by a noninvasive method, on the pharmacokinetic of a soluble dye in a tumor tissue compared to a normal tissue.

Cultured parental CTL were not leukemia specific but alloreactive as evidenced by equivalent cytotoxicity against stimulating ALL blasts and ConA-stimulated blasts from the other parent. The cultures yielded primarily CD8(+) T cells (59%). Irradiation of CTL limited proliferation by 96% but had no short-term effects on leukemia reactive cytotoxicity, suggesting a means to limit GVHD potential in vivo. One patient was treated for relapse of ALL post-haploidentical transplant with CTL generated from the original donor. A total of nine infusions were given: the first three were irradiated, while the last six were not due to disease progression. The patient experienced clearance of peripheral blasts, and despite concomitant infusion of IL-2 with the last three CTL infusions, did not experience immediate GVHD reactions.

We conducted a survey of filgrastim-treated related donors to determine the incidence of leukemia after PBPC donation. Of the 343 PBPC donors eligible for inclusion in the survey, 281 (82%) were interviewed by telephone between December 1998 and February 2000. The mean age at donation was 44 years. The median time elapsed after PBPC donation was 39 months, and in 278 (99%) of the interviewed donors it was at least 1 year. At the time of the interview none of the donors had been diagnosed with acute or chronic leukemia.

Improved supportive care and patient selection have resulted significant improvements in toxicity with standard conditioning regimens. Further dose intensification to reduce the risk of relapse may therefore be feasible. We determined the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of a 5-day continuous infusion (CI) of etoposide when added to oral busulphan 16 mg/kg and intravenous cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg (Bu/Cy) as conditioning in 44 autograft and 18 allograft recipients at high risk of relapse. The major toxicity of escalating doses of etoposide was oral and gastro-intestinal mucositis, reflected by a statistically significant increase in the requirement for total parenteral nutrition in both autografts and allograft recipients. Time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, opiate analgesia requirements, and duration of hospitalization were not affected by etoposide dose escalation. The MTD in autograft recipients was 300 mg/m(2)/day (1500 mg/m(2) total dose), and 100 mg/m(2)/day (500 mg/m(2) total dose) for allograft recipients. Mucositis and hepatotoxicity were more frequent in allograft recipients, suggesting that methotrexate may have contributed to the lower tolerable dose in these patients. As a consequence, further dose escalation may not be possible in heavily pre-treated patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. Conversely, high dose CI etoposide can be added with relative safety to Bu/Cy in autograft recipients.","['Ritchie, D S', 'Szer, J', 'Roberts, A W', 'Shuttleworth, P', 'Grigg, A P']","['Ritchie DS', 'Szer J', 'Roberts AW', 'Shuttleworth P', 'Grigg AP']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Male', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/11/07 04:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703698 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Nov;30(10):645-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703698.,,,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, artefactual DNA oxidation during its extraction and subsequent work-up may give rise to overestimated levels of oxidized DNA bases. In the present study, we have used (18)O-labelled 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) as an internal standard to evaluate the extent of artefactual DNA oxidation during the critical steps preceding the measurement. The labelled oxidized purine nucleoside was specifically generated in cellular DNA using the recently available generator of (18)O-labelled singlet oxygen. Artefactual DNA oxidation that could take place during the work-up increases the level of 8-oxodGuo but not of the (18)O-oxidized nucleoside. Therefore, the ratio between the two compounds, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, allows an unambiguous comparison of different methodologies. The comparison of different DNA extraction protocols led to the conclusion that artefactual DNA oxidation during the extraction step could be minimized if: (i) nuclei are isolated after cell lysis; (ii) desferrioxamine, a transition metal chelator is added to the different extraction buffers; and (iii) sodium iodide (or alternatively guanidine thiocyanate) is used for DNA precipitation. It was also demonstrated that sodium iodide does not decompose the targeted oxidized purine nucleoside. In addition, three different DNA digestion protocols were evaluated and they were found to give rise to similar results. Using the best-studied protocol, the steady-state cellular background level of 8-oxodGuo, in a lymphocyte cell line, was determined to be approximately 0.5 lesions/10(6) DNA nucleosides.","['Ravanat, Jean-Luc', 'Douki, Thierry', 'Duez, Pierre', 'Gremaud, Eric', 'Herbert, Karl', 'Hofer, Tim', 'Lasserre, Lydie', 'Saint-Pierre, Christine', 'Favier, Alain', 'Cadet, Jean']","['Ravanat JL', 'Douki T', 'Duez P', 'Gremaud E', 'Herbert K', 'Hofer T', 'Lasserre L', 'Saint-Pierre C', 'Favier A', 'Cadet J']","['Laboratoire Lesions des Acides Nucleiques, DRFMC/SCIB UMR 5046 CEA Grenoble, 17 Avenue des Martyrs, F-38054 Grenoble Cedex 9, France. jravanat@cea.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Artifacts', 'Cattle', 'Cell Fractionation/*methods', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Isotopes/analysis', 'Rats', 'Reference Standards', 'Reference Values', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Sodium Iodide/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",2002/11/07 04:00,2002/12/21 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/23.11.1911 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2002 Nov;23(11):1911-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/23.11.1911.,,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oxygen Isotopes)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'F5WR8N145C (Sodium Iodide)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'VQN7359ICQ (TEMPO)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a variety of gamma delta T-cell neoplasm was recognized; however, its clinicopathological features have not been extensively analyzed. Here we report the results of a clinicopathological study of 11 cases of gamma delta T-cell neoplasm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the 11-year period from 1989 to 1999, 104 patients with T-cell neoplasms were examined by flow cytometric analysis and/or immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor cells from all 104 patients expressed one or more of the T-cell antigens-CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD7. Forty-nine of the 104 cases of T-cell neoplasms were examined immunophenotypically for TCR alpha beta/gamma delta subsets. RESULTS: Expression of TCR gamma delta on tumor cells was found in five (33%) of 15 patients with precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, one (25%) of four with T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia and five (26%) of 19 with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), whereas no expression was found in 11 patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Primary sites of the five patients with gamma delta PTCL were as follows: lymph node, three; skin, one and liver, tonsil and skin, one. The courses of the three patients with gamma delta PTCL of nodal onset were very short (3, 5 and 9 months, respectively), and they were all resistant to combination chemotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Although gamma delta T-cell neoplasm constitutes a heterogeneous population, it is important to examine the expression of TCR with the view to identifying possible poor prognostic subgroups, such as primary nodal gamma delta T-cell lymphoma.","['Saito, T', 'Matsuno, Y', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Tobinai, K']","['Saito T', 'Matsuno Y', 'Tanosaki R', 'Watanabe T', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Tobinai K']","['Hematology Division and Clinical Laboratory Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/07 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf293 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63730-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Nov;13(11):1792-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf293.,30,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at diagnosis of HD was 40 years, and the median time at follow-up was 14 years. RESULTS: Of 197 SCs, 14 were acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 31 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 152 solid cancers. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was significantly increased for SCs as a group, and for the subgroups ANLL, NHL, lung cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer and melanoma. ANLL was related to heavy treatment with chemotherapy (CT) and combined CT and radiotherapy (RT), NHL was not treatment related, and solid tumors were related to radiotherapy only or combined RT and CT. The SIR of ANLL and NHL reached a peak between 5 and 10 years after treatment. Solid and non-solid tumors increased with young age at diagnosis of HD and solid tumors increased with follow-up time up to 28 years CONCLUSION: In a long-term follow-up study of HD patients of all ages, the SIR of solid tumors was high in patients treated at young age and decreased with increasing age. Most solid tumors had started within or at the edge of the irradiated field, and SIR of solid tumors increased even 20-30 years after diagnosis.","['Foss Abrahamsen, A', 'Andersen, A', 'Nome, O', 'Jacobsen, A B', 'Holte, H', 'Foss Abrahamsen, J', 'Kvaloy, S']","['Foss Abrahamsen A', 'Andersen A', 'Nome O', 'Jacobsen AB', 'Holte H', 'Foss Abrahamsen J', 'Kvaloy S']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Radiotherapy, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. harald.holte@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Probability', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/07 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf289 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63726-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Nov;13(11):1786-91. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf289.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since PRAME is only expressed at low levels in a few normal tissues and encodes an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes, it might be a good candidate for tumor immunotherapy. In this study, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to measure PRAME gene expression in 50 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Nine patients were also analyzed in relapse. Overexpression of PRAME was found in 42% (N = 21) of the patients. In accordance with our findings in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients, the rate of disease-free survival was higher and white blood cell counts at diagnosis were lower in patients with an overexpression of PRAME. However, in our group of ALL patients these findings were not statistically significant. The levels of expression at diagnosis corresponded well with those at relapse (P = 0.017). Although overexpression of PRAME was less frequent than in children with AML (62%) our results suggest that PRAME could be a useful target for immunotherapy in some children with ALL.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Viehmann, Susanne', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Steinbach D', 'Viehmann S', 'Zintl F', 'Gruhn B']","[""University Children's Hospital, Jena, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/07 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802005824 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00582-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Oct 1;138(1):89-91. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00582-4.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of them has limitations and is far from being accurate. Recently, a new multiparametric cell scanning system (Duet) was introduced to the field of MRD detection. This system has the advantage of automatically scanning large numbers of cells and performing combined analysis of morphology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the same cell. We used this system to characterize the lineage and degree of maturation of the cells carrying the minor m-BCR/ABL fusion, in a follow-up of an 8-year-old boy with Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The boy was treated using a high-risk protocol and was closely monitored with FISH analysis for cells carrying the m-BCR/ABL fusion. Consecutive analysis along 2.5 years from remission showed 0.2-4.5% m-BCR/ALB(+) cells in the peripheral blood (PB), which is within the accepted background range for this method. The combined analysis found that all the m-BCR/ABL(+) cells were mature lymphocytes. Because mature lymphocytes have a long life span in the circulation, this finding supports the fact that the patient is in remission. Moreover, since mature differentiated cells have a low proliferative capacity, there is a low risk for relapse.","['Bielorai, Bella', 'Golan, Hana', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Reichart, Malka', 'Toren, Amos', 'Daniely, Michal', 'Zilberstein, Yulia', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Kaplinsky, Chaim']","['Bielorai B', 'Golan H', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Reichart M', 'Toren A', 'Daniely M', 'Zilberstein Y', 'Amariglio N', 'Rechavi G', 'Kaplinsky C']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, 5262, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Size', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology']",2002/11/07 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802005782 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00578-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Oct 1;138(1):64-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00578-2.,,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the first presentation, the karyotype was normal, whereas 17 months later several chromosome aberrations were recognized including presumed additions to the short arms of chromosomes 1 and 16 in all cells, and numerous other aberrations in subpopulations of cells. From the predominance of aberrations at chromosome ends, we suspected insufficient telomere maintenance as an underlying mechanism behind the karyotype changes, in particular as an interstitial deletion in the region harboring the gene for the RNA component (hTERC) of the telomerase enzyme was also noticed; however, while molecular cytogenetic investigation confirmed the terminal aberrations, we found the malignant cells positive for telomerase activity and the presence of an hTERC gene on both chromosomes 3.

Labeling of multiple tandem repeat sequences in situ by a novel multicolor primed in situ hybridization showed no evidence of instability of other repeated DNA elements.","['Serakinci, Nedime', 'Ostergaard, Mette', 'Larsen, Herdis', 'Madsen, Bente', 'Pedersen, Bent', 'Koch, Jorn']","['Serakinci N', 'Ostergaard M', 'Larsen H', 'Madsen B', 'Pedersen B', 'Koch J']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, DK-8000, Aarhus C., Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2002/11/07 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/07 04:00'],"['2002/11/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802005332 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00533-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Oct 1;138(1):11-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00533-2.,,,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-packaging of two parental RNAs is a prerequisite for recombination in retroviruses, but formation of heterodimers has not been demonstrated directly in vivo. Here, we explore elements in Harvey sarcoma virus (HaSV) RNA involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization with RNA of Moloney (Mo) and Akv murine leukemia viruses (MLV). By an in vitro assay, we found that HaSV dimerization specificity could be modulated by mutations in a decanucleotide palindrome (Pal) probably folded into a kissing-loop. Autocomplementary and non-autocomplementary sequences introduced into the putative loop directed the specificity towards formation of homodimers and heterodimers, respectively. Two stem-loop (SL) structures, both exposing a GACG tetraloop, enhanced the formation of stable HaSV dimers.A similar decanucleotide palindrome has been implicated in homodimerization of MLVs. Heterodimers between HaSV RNA and Mo- or Akv MLV were unstable, but could be stabilized by introduction of two point mutations in the putative HaSV kissing-loop, creating exact complementarity with Mo/Akv MLV palindromes. Moreover, such changes increased the HaSV RNA affinity for the two MLV RNAs. Similar to HaSV RNA homodimers, formation of heterodimers with Mo- or Akv MLV RNAs was induced by the presence of GACG loops. On the basis of these results, we propose that palindromic sequences act as variable determinants of specificity and GACG tetraloops as conserved determinants in the formation of homodimers and heterodimers of gamma-retrovirus retroviral RNAs in vivo. The complementarity of loop sequences in the packaging signal upstream of the GACG tetraloops might therefore determine homo- and heterodimerization specificity and recombination activity of these viruses.","['Rasmussen, Soren Vestergaard', 'Mikkelsen, Jacob Giehm', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Rasmussen SV', 'Mikkelsen JG', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.F.

To gain insights into the molecular basis of this disease, we performed gene expression profiling of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from t-AML patients. Our analysis revealed that there are distinct subtypes of t-AML that have a characteristic gene expression pattern. Common to each of the subgroups are gene expression patterns typical of arrested differentiation in early progenitor cells. Leukemias with a -5/del(5q) have a higher expression of genes involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), and loss of expression of the gene encoding IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP). A second subgroup of t-AML is characterized by down-regulation of transcription factors involved in early hematopoiesis (TAL1, GATA1, and EKLF) and overexpression of proteins involved in signaling pathways in myeloid cells (FLT3) and cell survival (BCL2). Establishing the molecular pathways involved in t-AML may facilitate the identification of selectively expressed genes that can be exploited for the development of urgently needed targeted therapies.","['Qian, Zhijian', 'Fernald, Anthony A', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Qian Z', 'Fernald AA', 'Godley LA', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology and the Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA. zqian@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.222491799 [doi]', '222491799 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):14925-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.222491799.

Its excessive production plays a major role in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma and postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the course of a screening program aimed at IL-6 inhibitor from microbial products, we found madindoline A (MDL-A) and madindoline B, which have a fuloindoline structure with diketocyclopentene bound to the methyl group. MDL-A has no cytotoxic activities. It inhibited only activities of both IL-6 and IL-11 without affecting the IL-6-specific signal transduction cascade, JAK2/STAT3. In a dose-dependent manner [(3)H]MDL-A binds to gp130, which is a signal transducing 130-kDa glycoprotein, but formation of the trimeric complex IL-6/IL-6 receptor/gp130 was not inhibited, suggesting that MDL-A suppresses dimerization of trimeric complexes.

Here we show that MDL-A has a highly selective inhibitory effect on IL-6 and IL-11 activities by inhibiting a gp130 activity while suppressing bone loss in ovariectomized mice.

We generated Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells expressing a CBFbeta-SMMHC variant lacking 28 amino acids homologous to the assembly competence domain (ACD) required for multimerization of skeletal muscle myosin. CBFbeta-SMMHC(DeltaACD) multimerized less effectively than either wild-type protein or a variant lacking a different 28-residue segment. In contrast to the control proteins, the DeltaACD mutant did not inhibit CBF DNA binding, AML1-mediated reporter activation, or G(1) to S cell cycle progression, the last being dependent upon activation of CBF-regulated genes. We also linked the CBFbeta domain to 149 or 83 C-terminal CBFbeta-SMMHC residues, retaining 86 or 20 amino acids N-terminal to the ACD. CBFbeta-SMMHC(149C) multimerized and slowed Ba/F3 proliferation, whereas CBFbeta-SMMHC(83C) did not. The majority of CBFbeta-SMMHC and CBFbeta-SMMHC(149C) was detected in the nucleus, whereas the DeltaACD and 83C variants were predominantly cytoplasmic, indicating that multimerization facilitates nuclear retention of CBFbeta-SMMHC. When linked to the simian virus 40 nuclear localization signal (NLS), a significant fraction of CBFbeta-SMMHC(DeltaACD) entered the nucleus but only mildly inhibited CBF activities. As NLS-CBFbeta-SMMHC(83C) remained cytoplasmic, we directed the ACD to CBF target genes by linking it to the AML1 DNA binding domain or to full-length AML1. These AML1-ACD fusion proteins did not affect Ba/F3 proliferation, in contrast to AML1-ETO, which markedly slowed G(1) to S progression dependent upon the integrity of its DNA-binding domain. Thus, the ACD facilitates inhibition of CBF by mediating multimerization of CBFbeta-SMMHC in the nucleus. Therapeutics targeting the ACD may be effective in acute myeloid leukemia cases associated with CBFbeta-SMMHC expression.","['Kummalue, Tanawan', 'Lou, Jianrong', 'Friedman, Alan D']","['Kummalue T', 'Lou J', 'Friedman AD']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymers', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/01/03 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.23.8278-8291.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Dec;22(23):8278-91. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.23.8278-8291.2002.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smooth Muscle Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",,,['R01 HL15388/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC134059,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression regulation of DINE mRNA in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) after sciatic nerve injury is examined. A substantial increase of DINE mRNA expression was observed in relatively small-sized DRG neurons after nerve injury. The expression was observed in isolectin B4-negative and partly TrkA-positive neurons, and the expression profile was fairly similar to that of the neuropeptide galanin. More than 80% of DINE mRNA-positive neurons simultaneously demonstrated galanin immunoreactivity after nerve injury. In cultured DRG, DINE mRNA expression was enhanced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) but not by other growth factors and cytokines. LIF treatment to rat sciatic nerve induced DINE mRNA expression in DRG without nerve injury, and, conversely, the intranerve injection of anti-gp130 antibody after sciatic nerve injury significantly inhibited the upregulation of DINE mRNA in DRG. Furthermore, nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, which can induce galanin expression, also enhanced DINE mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo. Both LIF application and NGF deprivation additively enhanced DINE expression in vitro. These results suggest that DINE gene expression is regulated separately by both LIF and NGF deprivation, and this regulation pattern is similar to that of galanin gene expression. Because both DINE and galanin have a neuroprotective function, their simultaneous induction may provide more successful protection for injured sensory neurons.","['Kato, Ryuichi', 'Kiryu-Seo, Sumiko', 'Kiyama, Hiroshi']","['Kato R', 'Kiryu-Seo S', 'Kiyama H']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Galanin/biosynthesis', 'Ganglia, Spinal/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Metalloendopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sciatic Neuropathy/*metabolism/pathology']",2002/11/06 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['22/21/9410 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2002 Nov 1;22(21):9410-8.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase)']",,,,,,PMC6758025,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoting remyelination appears to be a crucial therapeutic challenge. Using a newly developed enzymatic index of myelination, we screened different neurotrophic factors for their ability to enhance myelination. Neurotrophins [NGF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4/5, BDNF], glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-related factors (GDNF, neurturin), and growth factors such as PDGF-AA, FGF-2, and insulin did not increase myelinogenesis. In contrast, among factors belonging to the CNTF family, CNTF, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M induced a strong promyelinating effect. We provide evidence that CNTF acts on oligodendrocytes by favoring their final maturation, and that this effect is mediated through the 130 kDa glycoprotein receptor common to the CNTF family and transduced through the Janus kinase pathway. Our results demonstrate a novel role for neurotrophic factors of the CNTF family and raise the possibility that these factors might be of therapeutic interest to promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis.","['Stankoff, Bruno', 'Aigrot, Marie-Stephane', 'Noel, Frederic', 'Wattilliaux, Aurelie', 'Zalc, Bernard', 'Lubetzki, Catherine']","['Stankoff B', 'Aigrot MS', 'Noel F', 'Wattilliaux A', 'Zalc B', 'Lubetzki C']","['Biologie des Interactions Neurones-Glie, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 495, Paris cedex 13, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelin Basic Protein/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Myelin Sheath/*metabolism', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",2002/11/06 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['22/21/9221 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2002 Nov 1;22(21):9221-7.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,PMC6758026,,,,,,,,,,,

Two peptides, designated RSVM and ASLW, were identified as novel agonists that are insensitive to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. In chemotaxis assays using the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM, RSVM behaves as a partial agonist and ASLW as a superagonist.

GlcNAc-TIII transfers GlcNAc in beta4-linkage to the core Man of complex or hybrid N-glycans, and thereby alters not only the composition, but also the conformation of the N-glycan. The dramatic consequences of the addition of this bisecting GlcNAc residue are reflected in the altered binding of lectins that recognize Gal residues on N-glycans. Changes in GlcNAc-TIII expression correlate with hepatoma and leukemia in rodents and humans, and the bisecting GlcNAc on Asn 297 of human IgG antibodies enhances their effector functions. Overexpression of a cDNA encoding GlcNAc-TIII alters growth control and cell-cell interactions in cultured cells, and in transgenic mice.

Further biological functions of GlcNAc-TIII are expected to be uncovered as mice with a null mutation in the Mgat3 gene are challenged.","['Stanley, Pamela']",['Stanley P'],"['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York, NY 10461, USA. stanley@aecom.yu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/*physiology']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['S030441650200404X [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(02)00404-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Dec 19;1573(3):363-8. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(02)00404-x.,39,,"['EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.144 (beta-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein', 'beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)']",,,['R01 30645/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexity and nature of cytogenetic abnormalities was in direct relationship with the disease evolution. The first case, a 22 years old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia type L3, exhibited many structural changes in bone marrow cells with diploid number of chromosomes: del(3)(q26); del (5)(p13); t(8;14) (q24;q32); del(9)(p11q11);inv(15)(p12qter). The second case, a 62 years old woman, diagnosed as poorly differentiated acute leukemia, refractory to treatment, showed hiperdiploidy (48-54 chromosomes) and 3-4 markers derived from chromosomes 5 and 12. The third case, a young man of 27 years old, diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia, apart of Philadelphia chromosome, presented trisomy 16, both in diploid and aneuploid cells. None of these three patients did respond to any medical therapy. Their rapid death was a powerful proof of the correlation between the complexity of genome changes and disease aggressiveness. In the fourth case, a constitutional translocation t(3;5)(q26.3;q21) identified in a 72 years old woman with essential thrombocythemia, appeared not to be involved in the etiology of the disease. In this case, the treatment with hydroxyurea was successful and the disease evolution was favourable. In conclusion, we appreciate that in the three cases of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias it was a direct relationship between the complexity of genomic changes and the aggressiveness of the disease.","['Lungeanu, Agripina', 'Arghir, Aurora', 'Lupu, Anca', 'Mut Popescu, Delia']","['Lungeanu A', 'Arghir A', 'Lupu A', 'Mut Popescu D']","['Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania. genetica@vbabes.ro']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Thrombocytosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['006.003.07 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2002.tb00517.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2002 Jul-Sep;6(3):389-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2002.tb00517.x.,,,,,,,,,PMC6740208,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we tested whether OX40 signaling affects the Fas-mediated apoptosis of fresh ATL cells isolated from 7 patients (3 acute type, 3 chronic type, and 1 smoldering type). In all these patients, the coculture of ATL cells with MMCE/OX40 ligand gp34, a stable human gp34 transfectant of a mouse epithelial cell line, resulted in a decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells after treatment with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, compared to coculture with MMCE/mock controls. Similar findings were obtained in OX40(+)- human T-cell leukemia virus type I-transformed T-cell lines. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon, we used Kit225/OX40, a stable OX40 transfectant of an IL-2-dependent T-cell line, and its deletion mutant, Kit225/del-OX40, in which the intracytoplasmic domain of OX40 had been deleted. Coculture with MMCE/gp34 inhibited the apoptosis of Kit225/OX40, but Kit225/del-OX40 apoptosis was hardly affected. These results suggest that ATL cells may escape Fas-mediated destruction of the immune system through OX40 signaling.","['Kunitomi, Akane', 'Hori, Toshiyuki', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Kunitomi A', 'Hori T', 'Maeda M', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, OX40', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*pharmacology']",2002/11/06 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982796 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Oct;76(3):260-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02982796.,,,"['0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfrsf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine (PAV) combination of drugs, 10 of the 16 Ph patients with ALL (62.5%) showed relative resistance (RR) (sensitivity to only 1 or to none of the 3 drugs) at initiation of treatment.

We demonstrate that a theoretically sound principle can be uniformly applied to the developments of cluster-optimization function, comprehensive data-visualization strategy, and objective cluster-evaluation measures as well as actual implementation of the principle.

The studies described here have correlated the in vitro accumulation and retention properties of verapamil (VRP) in murine P388 (sensitive) and P388/ADR (MDR) cells with doxorubicin (DOX) uptake and cytotoxicity modulation characteristics in order to better understand VRP-tumor cell interactions that give rise to MDR modulation. VRP is rapidly taken up by DOX-sensitive and -resistant P388 cells where greater than 50% maximal VRP uptake occurs within 10 min of initial exposure at 37 degrees C. Whereas chemosensitization and DOX uptake in P388/ADR cells increase with increasing VRP concentration until a plateau is achieved at approximately 5 microM VRP, cellular modulator levels increase proportionally with increasing VPR concentrations beyond 20 microM. Subsequent to removal of noncell-associated modulator, VRP levels in both sensitive and resistant cells rapidly fall below 10% of those obtained at uptake equilibrium. However, a residual amount of VRP remains associated with the cells for extended time periods after the cells are washed. Pulse exposures of P388/ADR cells to high concentrations of VRP (50-100 microM) are capable of providing extended cell-associated VRP levels comparable to those obtained with continuous exposure at biologically active VRP concentrations (1-3 microM) and this leads to chemosensitization. These results are consistent with the existence of high- and low-affinity intracellular VRP pools in P388 MDR cells, both of which can contribute to the reversal of drug resistance. It is suggested that these properties should be taken into consideration during the design and evaluation of preclinical in vivo MDR models where pulsed exposure to high concentrations of resistance modulators often occurs. Special attention must be given to whether such high concentration pulses are desirable and/or achievable in relevant clinical settings.","['Mayer, Lawrence D', 'Lim, Kye-Taek', 'Hartley, Daria']","['Mayer LD', 'Lim KT', 'Hartley D']","['Department of Advanced Therapeutics, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 600 West 10th Ave. Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Residues', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Verapamil/*pharmacokinetics']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.1009x.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2002 Mar-Apr;2(2):107-20. doi: 10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.1009x.x.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination has been shown to produce greater than expected DNA damage compared wot what was observed with either drug alone. Promising preclinical results led to Phase I and Phase II trials of trifluoperazine and bleomycin, which revealed activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite the unique activity of the combination, the mechanism underlying the DNA damaging effect remained poorly understood. In several systems, DNA damage leads to the induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis, which is characterized by interoligonucleosomal cleavage of DNA. To determine whether the activity of the combination of bleomycin with trifluoperazine was due to induction of apoptosis, we exposed L1210 leukemic lymphocytes to bleomycin in the presence or absence of trifluoperazine. The combination produced DNA laddering, cellular shrinkage, and chromatin condensation typical of programmed cell death. Cell cycle analyses revealed a blockade of cells in G2/M, suggesting the presence of mutant p53, which was confirmed by immunoanalysis. In addition, L1210 cells were found not to overexpress Bcl-2 in the presence or absence of drugs. These results indicate that the enhancement of bleomycin induced DNA damage by trifluoperazine is mediated, at least in part, through the induction of apoptosis.","['Sullivan, Gregory F', 'Garcia-Welch, Adrienne', 'White, Eileen', 'Lutzker, Stuart', 'Hait, William N']","['Sullivan GF', 'Garcia-Welch A', 'White E', 'Lutzker S', 'Hait WN']","['University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Synergism', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Trifluoperazine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/06 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/11/06 04:00'],"['2002/11/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.01002.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2002 Jan-Feb;2(1):19-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1359-4117.2002.01002.x.,,,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['CA43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60088/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlations for most metrics were increased among children who had annual measurements performed during the same season. The metric with the highest year-to-year correlation was the GM. The lowest correlations were found for metrics estimating field intermittency and temporal stability. First to second year GMs were well correlated when taken in the same home (Spearman rank correlation = 0.70), but a lower correlation (0.44) was noted among residentially mobile children.

In tissue culture, cells can be either lytically or latently infected, depending on cell type. Regulation of FV replication is controlled by two promoters: the LTR and a second promoter within the env gene termed the internal promoter (IP). The IP directs expression of the transcriptional activator, Tas, and a second accessory protein, Bet, whose function has been elusive. In this study, we report that expression of exogenous Tas is sufficient to initiate a switch from latent to lytic replication. We also show that treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) can lead to an increase in transcription from the IP, and that Bet protein expression abrogates this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that Bet expression severely limits the ability of PMA to activate transcription of latent FV genomes, and that replication of a Bet(-) virus is more easily activated than wild-type FV. Taken together, these data suggest that viral transcription is regulated by a sensitive switch, and that Bet functions as a negative regulator of basal IP activity.","['Meiering, Christopher D', 'Linial, Maxine L']","['Meiering CD', 'Linial ML']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Spumavirus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology', 'Virus Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Virus Latency/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.242491999 [doi]', '242491999 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):15130-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.242491999.

We used chromosomal translocations and Ig heavy chain (IGH)/T cell antigen receptor (TCR) rearrangements to develop an understanding of the etiology and natural history of this subtype of leukemia. We sequenced the genomic fusion between E2A and PBX1 in 22 preB acute lymphoblastic leukemias and two cell lines. The prenatal origin of the leukemia was assessed in 15 pediatric patients by screening for the clonotypic E2A-PBX1 translocation in neonatal blood spots, or Guthrie cards, obtained from the children at the time of birth. Two patients were determined to be weakly positive for the fusion at the time of birth, in contrast to previously studied childhood leukemia fusions, t(12;21), t(8;21), and t(4;11), which were predominantly prenatal. The presence of extensive N-nucleotides at the point of fusion in the E2A-PBX1 translocation as well as specific characteristics of the IGH/TCR rearrangements provided additional evidence for a postnatal, preB cell origin. Intriguingly, 16 of 24 breakpoints on the 3.2-kb E2A intron 14 were located within 5 bp, providing evidence for a site-specific recombination mechanism. Breakpoints on the 232-kb PBX1 intron 1 were more dispersed but highly clustered proximal to exon 2. In sum, the translocation breakpoints displayed evidence of unique temporal, ontological, and mechanistic formation than the previously analyzed pediatric leukemia translocation breakpoints and emphasize the need to differentiate cytogenetic and molecular subgroups for studies of leukemia causality.","['Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Leonard, Brian C', 'Wang, Yunxia', 'Segal, Mark R', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Crouse, Vonda', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Pine, Sharon R']","['Wiemels JL', 'Leonard BC', 'Wang Y', 'Segal MR', 'Hunger SP', 'Smith MT', 'Crouse V', 'Ma X', 'Buffler PA', 'Pine SR']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA. wiemels@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.222481199 [doi]', '222481199 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):15101-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.222481199.

In this study, we show that BAF is an authentic component of MoMLV. Analysis of the sedimentation properties of initial, salt-stripped, and BAF-reconstituted PICs reveals that the viral DNA within the PIC is reversibly compacted by BAF, consistent with the functional role of BAF in protecting the viral DNA from autointegration. Furthermore, we find that BAF can promote the association of PICs with target DNA. Thus, our data suggest that BAF plays critical roles in promoting preferential intermolecular integration by both blocking autointegration and stimulating the capture of target DNA.","['Suzuki, Youichi', 'Craigie, Robert']","['Suzuki Y', 'Craigie R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Virus Integration/genetics/*physiology']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.23.12376-12380.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Dec;76(23):12376-80. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.23.12376-12380.2002.,,,"['0 (BANF1 protein, human)', '0 (Banf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,,,PMC136854,,,,,,,,,,,

S. Ter-Grigorov, O. Krifuks, E. Liubashevsky, A. Nyska, Z. Trainin, and V. Toder, Nat. Med. 3:37-41, 1997). In the present study, BALB/cJ mice inoculated with virus-containing plasma from affected mice developed splenomegaly, which was caused by increased numbers of Sca-1(+) Lin(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Biological and molecular analyses of a new virus revealed a mixture of murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). These MuLVs comprised ecotropic and mink lung cell focus-forming (MCF) virus classes and are termed Rauscher-like MuLVs because they bear numerous similarities to the ecotropic and MCF viruses of the Rauscher MuLV complex but do not include a spleen focus-forming virus. The ecotropic virus component alone transferred some disease characteristics, while MCF virus alone did not. Thus, we have described a novel virus mixture, termed Rauscher-like MuLV, that causes an increase in hematopoiesis due to activation of pluripotent HSC. Experiments using mice and a protocol that replicated the pregnancy and immunization strategy of the original experiment demonstrated that endogenous BALB/c mouse ecotropic and xenotropic MuLVs are activated by these treatments. Emv1 was expressed in the spleens of multiparous mice but not in those of virgin mice, and Bxv1Emv1-pseudotyped MuLVs were recovered following injection of fixed, activated B6 cells. Thus, multiple pregnancies and allostimuli appear to have provided the signals required for activation of and recombination among endogenous viruses and could have resulted in generation of the Rauscher-like MuLV mixture.","['Hook, Lauren M', 'Jude, Brooke A', 'Ter-Grigorov, Victor S', 'Hartley, Janet W', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Trainin, Zeev', 'Toder, Vladimir', 'Chervonsky, Alexander V', 'Golovkina, Tatyana V']","['Hook LM', 'Jude BA', 'Ter-Grigorov VS', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Trainin Z', 'Toder V', 'Chervonsky AV', 'Golovkina TV']","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Female', 'Genes, env', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Isoantigens', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pregnancy', 'Rauscher Virus/genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spleen/virology']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.23.12112-12122.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Dec;76(23):12112-22. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.23.12112-12122.2002.,,,['0 (Isoantigens)'],,,"['P30 CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC136857,,,,,,,,,,,

PARP-1, a nuclear enzyme, binds tightly to nicked DNA and synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) as an early response to DNA damage. To investigate the role of PARP-1 in retroviral integration, we infected wild-type and PARP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) separately with two HIV type 1-derived, vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped lentivirus vectors. Surprisingly, infection of both wild-type and PARP-1-deficient cells was observed with both vectors. Marker gene transduction and provirus formation by one vector was reduced by 45 to 75% compared to the wild type, but the other vector was unaffected by the PARP-1 mutant. In addition, PARP-1-deficient MEFs infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus showed no decrease in virus output after infection compared to the wild type.

In this study, we analyzed the expression and the functional relevance of MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) and UL16 binding protein (ULBP), the major cellular ligands for human NKG2D, in human tumor cell lines of different histological origin. We show that MICA and ULBP are frequently coexpressed by carcinoma cell lines, whereas MICA is expressed more frequently than ULBP by melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, the MICA(-) ULBP(+) phenotype was detected in most T cell leukemia cell lines, whereas the MICA(-) ULBP(-) phenotype characterized all acute myeloid leukemia and most B-cell lymphoma cell lines analyzed. These results, together with functional experiments, based on monoclonal antibody-mediated blocking of either NKG2D or its ligands, showed that killing of certain MICA(-) cell tumors is at least in part NKG2D dependent. Indeed, leukemic T cells as well as certain B-cell lymphomas were killed in a NKG2D-dependent fashion upon recognition of ULBP molecules. Moreover, ULBP could induce NKG2D-mediated NK cell triggering also in tumors coexpressing MICA.

The blockade was determined by cell cycle analysis and chromosome distribution. Kinase activities of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 responsible for the G(1)-S transition were increased, as were the activities of mitotic cyclin B and cdc2. 3-IAABE treatment also increased p53 expression and dephosphorylated (or activated) retinoblastoma protein.

DNA fragmentation factor and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the downstream substrates of caspase-3 and -6, were cleaved after 3 h of exposure to 3-IAABE, followed by DNA fragmentation. Pretreatment of the cells with inhibitors of caspase-9, -3, or -6, respectively, inhibited the cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and thus inhibited the onset of apoptosis. 3-IAABE showed antitumor activities in the panel of 60 National Cancer Institute human tumor cell lines with total growth inhibition in the range of 0.22-4.3 micro M for solid tumor lines and 0.025-0.22 micro M for leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. The 3-IAABU total growth inhibition of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated healthy human lymphocytes was 450-fold greater than that of leukemic cells. 3-IAABE significantly inhibited the growth of human hepatocarcinoma (BEL-7402) in nude mice by 72% in tumor volume, more strongly than did vincristine (43 percent inhibition). Besides being a novel lead for the design of new anticancer tubulin ligands, the activity of 3-IAABE in the cell cycle may also help us to understand the molecular pharmacology of microtubule-active drugs.","['Jiang, Jian-Dong', 'Denner, Larry', 'Ling, Yi-He', 'Li, Jian-Nong', 'Davis, Ashley', 'Wang, Yue', 'Li, Yan', 'Roboz, Julia', 'Wang, Long-Gui', 'Perez-Soler, Roman', 'Marcelli, Marco', 'Bekesi, George', 'Holland, James F']","['Jiang JD', 'Denner L', 'Ling YH', 'Li JN', 'Davis A', 'Wang Y', 'Li Y', 'Roboz J', 'Wang LG', 'Perez-Soler R', 'Marcelli M', 'Bekesi G', 'Holland JF']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine-New York University, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Iodoacetamide/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Nov 1;62(21):6080-8.,,,"['0 (3-iodoacetamido benzoyl ethyl ester)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZRH8M27S79 (Iodoacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the BCR/ABL-positive cell line KBM5, we studied cellular events associated with the in vitro acquisition of resistance to STI571. The emergence of the STI571-resistant phenotype was accompanied by only a marginal increase in the number of copies of the BCR/ABL gene and its level of expression. The activity of the Bcr/Abl kinase (level of autophosphorylation) in resistant cells was, however, incompletely inhibited by STI571, and the acquisition of the high degree of resistance was associated with a single-point mutation leading to a substitution of a threonine-to-isoleucine at position 315 of Abl. In the resistant KBM5-STI571(R1.0) cells, 20% of the BCR/ABL transcripts and 10% of BCR/ABL gene copies on the DNA level were mutated. The mutation was present in all 10 STI571-resistant clones derived from low density clonogenic assay, confirming its presence in all colony-forming cells but only in a fraction of the BCR/ABL gene copies in each cell. The contribution of this mutation to STI571-resistant phenotype remains unknown. Preliminary data showing partial reversibility of resistance in these cells suggest that resistance may be multifactorial.

This study aimed to assess the frequency, relationship and impact of p53 abnormalities and those of its inhibitor mdm2 in blastoid and non-blastoid MCL in leukemic phase. DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolated blood lymphocytes from 21 patients with MCL in leukemic phase, characterized by the presence of t(11;14), were analyzed by flow cytometry and by fluorescent in situ hybridization in order to investigate whether there is a correlation between overexpression and deletion of p53, overexpression of mdm2 and gain of chromosome 12. Results were also correlated with morphologic subtypes, proliferative activity assessed by expression of Ki67 and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Cells from 2/21 (10%) and 7/21 (33%) patients overexpressed p53 and mdm2, respectively. No single case expressed both proteins. Ten out of 19 (53%) patients had a hemizygous loss of 17p (p53) including the 2 patients (11%) overexpressing p53. Gains of chromosome 12 (mdm2) were found in only 2 cases with expression of mdm2 in one of them. Overall, p53 deletion and/or overexpression of mdm2 was found in 71% of cases. Ten of 19 patients had a blastoid MCL, including all 5 patients who were Ki67 positive, 6 of the 7 patients expressing mdm2 and one of the 2 patients expressing p53. There was no correlation between p53 deletion and morphologic subtypes. All patients with blastoid MCL have died after a median time of 25 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In MCL in leukemic phase there is a high frequency of p53 deletion and/or overexpression of mdm2. In contrast, over expression of p53 is relatively rare. Overexpression of mdm2 is seen predominantly in blastoid MCL, the latter being characterized by a short median survival, and seems unrelated to a numerical gain of chromosome 12. It does not reflect a high proliferative rate but might indicate an alternative mechanism of inactivating p53 in prognostically adverse types of MCL.","['Solenthaler, Max', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Brito-Babapulle, Vasantha', 'Morilla, Ricardo', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Solenthaler M', 'Matutes E', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. max.solenthaler@insel.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Trisomy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Nov;87(11):1141-50.,,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that the presence of CD56 antigen, an isoform of the neural adhesion molecule, in AML cells is a negative independent prognostic factor for the achievement of complete remission (CR) and correlates with shorter survival. Since in our previous report we observed a more frequent PGP expression in CD56+ patients, we hypothesized that the reduced response to chemotherapy in this group of patients was due to increased PGP-mediated drug efflux. To confirm this hypothesis in this study PGP and CD56 expression on AML cells was correlated with other clinical and biological features and treatment response. DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunophenotypic analysis, including evaluation of CD56 and PGP expression, was performed using multiparameter flow cytometry on fresh and/or cryopreserved blast cells, obtained after informed consent, from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of 143 consecutive newly diagnosed AML cases at the time of diagnosis. Samples expressing CD56 in at least 15% or more cells were considered as positive (CD56+). PGP expression was expressed as a mean fluorescence index (MFI) i.e. as the ratio of sample mean fluorescence channel and the isotypic control mean fluorescence channel. RESULTS: Overall results showed that 67/143 cases were PGP-/CD56-, 23/143 were PGP+ /CD56+, 40/143 were PGP+/CD56- and the remaining 13/143 were PGP-/CD56+. CD56+ and PGP+ on AML cells significantly reduced the CR rate (83% in the PGP-/CD56- group vs 60% in the PGP-/CD56+ group, 46% in the PGP+/CD56- group and 58% in the PGP+/CD56+ group, p = 0.002). In addition we observed a significantly higher proportion of total failures in patients expressing PGP or CD56 compared to in the group not expressing either (73% vs 27%, respectively; p = 0.0001). CD56 and PGP overexpression influenced the overall survival: in fact, the median survival of CD56+ and PGP+ patients ranged from 10 to 23 months, while the actuarial survival of CD56-/PGP- patients at 5 years is 52% (p = 0.023). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data underline the independent negative prognostic role of PGP and CD56 expression in acute myeloid leukemia. Since the mechanism by which CD56 reduces drug sensitivity is still unknown, further investigations are required.","['Raspadori, Donatella', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Stocchi, Raffaella', 'Gentili, Sara', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Masolini, Paola', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Raspadori D', 'Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Stocchi R', 'Gentili S', 'Gozzetti A', 'Masolini P', 'Michelutti A', 'Geromin A', 'Fanin R', 'Lauria F']","['Department of Hematology, University of Siena, Italy. raspadori@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Nov;87(11):1135-40.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about MRD evaluation in adult T-cell ALL. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of MRD measurements in adult T-cell ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma (G) and TCR delta (D) gene analyses were carried out at presentation in 49 patients with de novo T-ALL using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. In 26 of the patients bone marrow (BM) samples were collected at sequential time points (0-2, 3-5, 6-9, 10-24 months) after diagnosis for MRD investigation. The relationship between MRD status and clinical outcome was investigated and correlated with age, gender and white blood cell count at presentation. RESULTS: TCRG clonal gene rearrangements were found in 40 patients (82%). Eleven patients showed TCRD rearrangements (22%), in one of them as the sole molecular marker. V(gamma)I family rearrangements predominated (45 of 65 alleles) together with V(delta)1-J(delta)1/2 (9 of 13 alleles). Continuous clinical remission (CCR) occurred in 17 patients while nine patients relapsed. MRD analysis showed that negative tests during the first 6 months post-induction, and persisting negative MRD after induction were the best predictors of CCR. A positive test after 5 months was better at predicting relapse. In only four of seven patients was relapse preceded by a positive test the 5 months preceding relapse. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall the ability of positive and negative tests to predict relapse or CCR was weaker in this cohort of adult T-ALL patients than in T- and B-lineage childhood ALL and B-lineage adult ALL. TCRG and TCRD gene analysis provides a clonal marker in the majority of adult T-ALL. These results suggest that caution should be taken in using MRD data based on TCR gene rearrangements to predict prognosis in adult T-ALL. Biological reasons may underlie differences between the performance of MRD tests in B- and T-lineage ALL. Further studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to determine the exact role that MRD determination has in the management of T-ALL in adults.","['Gameiro, Paula', 'Mortuza, Forida Y', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Gameiro P', 'Mortuza FY', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, Rowland Hill Street, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Nov;87(11):1126-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the time course and localization of LIF mRNA expression following kainic acid-induced seizures were examined by northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid at a convulsive dose induced LIF mRNA expression intensely in the hippocampus and moderately to weakly in the cerebral cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus. The expression peaked at 8-24 h after the injection in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and at 8 h in the thalamus and hypothalamus. In situ hybridization revealed different time courses of LIF mRNA expression depending on the area of the hippocampus; that is, the expression peaked at 10 h in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, then at 12 h in the polymorph and molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, and finally at 12-24 h in the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 and CA3 subfields. It is worth noting that the expression of LIF mRNA was intense in the dentate gyrus, the region where neurogenesis and aberrant network reorganization have been shown to be induced by seizures.

Here we show that eotaxin also induces chemotactic migration in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells. This effect was dose-dependently inhibited by compound X, a selective CCR3 antagonist, indicating that, as in eosinophils, the effect was mediated by CCR3. Eotaxin-induced cell migration was completely blocked in RBL-RacN17 cells expressing a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, suggesting a crucial role for Rac1 in eotaxin signaling to chemotactic migration. ERK activation also proved essential for eotaxin signaling and it too was absent in RBL-RacN17 cells. Finally, we found that activation of Rac and ERK was correlated with eotaxin-induced actin reorganization known to be necessary for cell motility. It thus appears that Rac1 acts upstream of ERK to signal chemotaxis in these cells, and that a Rac-ERK-dependent cascade mediates the eotaxin-induced chemotactic motility of RBL-2H3 mast cells.","['Woo, Chang-Hoon', 'Jeong, Dong Tak', 'Yoon, Seog-Beom', 'Kim, Key-Sun', 'Chung, Il Yup', 'Saeki, Toshihiko', 'Kim, Jae-Hong']","['Woo CH', 'Jeong DT', 'Yoon SB', 'Kim KS', 'Chung IY', 'Saeki T', 'Kim JH']","['Graduate School of Biotechnology, Korea University, 5-1 Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokines, CC/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Mast Cells/*cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02024324 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02432-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Nov 1;298(3):392-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02432-4.,,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Ccl11 protein, rat)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biophys. Res. Commun. 293 (5) (2002) 1489]. In this study we investigated whether apoptotic pathways are affected in two human T-cell lymphoblastic MOLT-4 cell lines with acquired resistance to Ara-G. In contrast to the MOLT-4 wild type cells, Ara-G resistant cells displayed no increase in caspase-3 or caspase-9 activity, DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release or a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(mito)) upon Ara-G treatment. A drop in the DeltaPsi(mito) was induced in wild type cells after treatment with tributyltin, an inducer of mitochondrial permeability transition, and with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupling agent that reduces the DeltaPsi(mito), although not in Ara-G resistant cells. Ara-G resistant cells displayed higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in immunoblots. A recent study indicates that Ara-G-induced apoptosis is mediated in part via the Fas pathway [Cancer Res. 43 (2047) (2002) 411]. When cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody, the wild type cell line exhibited increased caspase-3-like activity but the Ara-G resistant cells did not. Using FACS analysis and semi-quantitative PCR, 3-6-fold decreased protein levels and almost no detectable mRNA levels of Fas in the resistant cells were recorded. These data indicate that the inability to induce apoptosis via both the apoptosome pathway and the Fas pathway, due to increased levels of Bcl-xL and a lack of Fas, contributes to Ara-G resistance. This resistance to apoptosis in Ara-G resistant cells may serve to explain the overall resistance to a variety of anti-neoplastic drugs.","['Mansson, Emma', 'Stridh, Helene', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Mansson E', 'Stridh H', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

UK-1 has been reported to possess anticancer activity but no activity against bacteria, yeast, or fungi. Previous work has also demonstrated the ability of UK-1 to bind a variety of di- and tri-valent metal ions, particularly Mg(2+) ions, and to form complexes with double-stranded DNA in the presence of Mg(2+) ions. Here we report the activity of UK-1 against a wide range of human cancer cell lines. UK-1 displays a wide spectrum of potent anticancer activity against leukemia, lymphoma, and certain solid tumor-derived cell lines, with IC(50) values as low as 20 nM, but is inactive against Staphylococcus aureus, a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A series of analogues of the bis(benzoxazole) natural product UK-1 in which the carbomethoxy-substituted benzoxazole ring of the natural product was modified were prepared and evaluated for their anticancer and antibacterial properties. An analogue of UK-1 in which the carbomethoxy-substituted benzoxazole ring was replaced with a carbomethoxy-substituted benzimidazole ring was inactive against human cancer cell lines and the two strains of S. aureus. In contrast, a simplified analogue in which the carbomethoxy-substituted benzoxazole ring was replaced with a carbomethoxy group was almost as active as UK-1 against the four cancer cell lines examined but lacked activity against S. aureus. Metal ion binding studies of these analogues demonstrate that they both bind Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions about as well as UK-1. The non-cytotoxic benzimidazole UK-1 analogue binds Mg(2+) ions 50-fold weaker than UK-1, whereas the simple benzoxazole analogue binds Mg(2+) ions nearly as well as UK-1. These results support a role of Mg(2+) ion binding in the selective cytotoxicity of UK-1 and provide a minimal pharmacophore for the selective cytotoxic activity of the natural product.","['Kumar, Devinder', 'Jacob, Melissa R', 'Reynolds, Michael B', 'Kerwin, Sean M']","['Kumar D', 'Jacob MR', 'Reynolds MB', 'Kerwin SM']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Benzoxazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cations/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Magnesium/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/11/05 04:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0968089602003279 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(02)00327-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2002 Dec;10(12):3997-4004. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(02)00327-9.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzoxazoles)', '0 (Cations)', '151271-53-3 (UK 1)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to report on 520 patients below 19 years of age undergoing UD BMT in 31 Italian centers between September 1989 and December 2001, and to focus on the results achieved in the 423 patients grafted before December 2000. DESIGNS AND METHODS: In 1989 the Italian Bone Marrow Transplant Group (GITMO) and the Italian Association for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP) established the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (IBMDR) to facilitate donor search and marrow procurement for patients lacking an HLA identical sibling. By the end of December 2001, 296,720 HLA-A, B typed volunteer donors had been cumulatively registered and 3,411 searches had been activated for Italian patients. At least one HLA-A, B, DRB1 matched donor was found for 54% of the patients and 520 UD BMTs were performed in patients below 19 years of age before December 2001. Since 1999 more than 90% of the patients < or = 14 years old, and more than 50% of the patients 15-18 years old undergoing UD BMT have been treated in AIEOP institutions. In 50% of the cases donors were found in the IBMDR, and in 50% they were found in 14 other Registries. The average time from search activation to transplant was 6 months for diseases other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while for CML it was 8.7 months. RESULTS: Actuarial 100-day transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 32% in patients grafted between 1989 and 1997, and 21% for patients grafted after 1998 (p = 0.003). Twenty-eight per cent of the patients developed grade III or IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and 20% developed extensive chronic GvHD. The rate of disease-free survival at three years was 37% for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 38% for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients, 59% for patients with inborn errors, and 51% for patients with CML. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the IBMDR has benefited a substantial number of patients lacking a matched sibling and has facilitated the recruitment of UDs into the international donor pool. Results show a positive trend after 1998, mainly due to a decrease in transplant-related-mortality.","['Dini, Giorgio', 'Cancedda, Roberta', 'Giorgiani, Giovanna', 'Porta, Fulvio', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Uderzo, Cornelio', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Arcese, William', 'Pollichieni, Simona', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Mazzolari, Evelina', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Vassallo, Elena', 'Cappelli, Barbara', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Dini G', 'Cancedda R', 'Giorgiani G', 'Porta F', 'Messina C', 'Uderzo C', 'Pession A', 'Fagioli F', 'La Nasa G', 'Arcese W', 'Pollichieni S', 'Zecca M', 'Lanino E', 'Mazzolari E', 'Cesaro S', 'Balduzzi A', 'Rondelli R', 'Vassallo E', 'Cappelli B', 'Locatelli F']","['U.O.

Moreover, the probability of relapse can rise up to 50% for some children presenting with very high risk (VHR) factors. Intensive chemotherapy and especially hematopoietic stem cell transplantation improved their outcome. The aim of this review is to assess the role of different approaches in the treatment of childhood VHR ALL on the basis of current data. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: Information on the ongoing international studies was obtained via Medline. Preliminary data from a prospective cooperative study are mentioned. STATE OF ART: During the last decade, different definitions of VHR factors in childhood ALL have been a crucial issue, so that therapeutic results of single or multicenter studies were difficult to compare. All investigators agreed in adopting most aggressive treatments in patients with poor prognostic factors such as molecular biological markers, chromosomal abnormalities and biological factors including poor prednisone response and resistance to initial chemotherapy. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (AlloBMT) in childhood VHR ALL in first complete remission is expected to yield better event-free survival than chemotherapy. The lack of valid information in the current literature about the real impact of both chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is essentially the result of the difficulty in setting up multicenter prospective studies. On the other hand, the principal biases of retrospective studies are the lack of homogeneous eligibility criteria, different first-line therapies adopted before AlloBMT and above all the waiting time to transplant which could have accounted for some of the survival advantage shown by AlloBMT patients compared to those treated with chemotherapy. PERSPECTIVES: Preliminary results of an ongoing international prospective study are presented and compare favorably with previous reports. The current scenario serves as an example of how to reach a consensus in the controversial treatment of childhood VHR ALL.","['Uderzo, Cornelio', 'Balduzzi, Adriana']","['Uderzo C', 'Balduzzi A']","[""BMT Unit, Clinica Pediatrica, l'Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale S.

This procedure avoids the invasiveness of bone marrow harvest and the risks related to general anesthesia. The main adverse effects of rhG-CSF are: bone pain, 84%, headache, 54%, fatigue, 31%, and nausea, 13%, which are usually scored by the donors as moderate to severe, resolving within 2-3 days after discontinuation of the cytokine. Analgesics, mainly acetaminophen, are sufficient to control the pain. Less than 5% of the donors experience non-cardiac chest pain, a local reaction at the injection site, insomnia, dizziness or a low-grade fever. Discontinuation of the PBSC procedure because of adverse effects of rhG-CSF or leukapheresis is rarely necessary (0.5%) but this good tolerability can be hampered by the need, in 5-20% of cases, for an adequate venous access that requires insertion of a central or venous catheter. There are no absolute contraindications to the stimulation of healthy donors with rhG-CSF but the description of cases of non-traumatic splenic rupture, iritis, cardiac ischemia, and gouty arthritis suggests that further precautionary restrictions are advisable when deciding eligibility for PBSC collection. The main advantages for patients receiving an allogeneic PBSC transplant are the faster hematologic and immunologic recovery and the potential for a greater efficacy in advanced disease by lowering the transplant-related mortality. One of the major concerns regarding the use of rhG-CSF in unrelated healthy donors is the uncertainty about its possible role in triggering malignancy, in particular myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. There are no studies with an adequate sample size and follow-up that can answer this question but two recent retrospective studies reported that in the medium term rhG-CSF is not associated with an excess of lymphoproliferative disorders. Currently, caution on the long-term safety of the use of rhG-CSF in healthy donor is still warranted but the data so far accumulated on allogeneic PBSC transplants are encouraging both as far as concerns the good short-medium tolerability profile of G-CSF-stimulation of the donor and the potential major efficacy in leukemia patients.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Marson, Piero', 'Gazzola, Maria Vittoria', 'De Silvestro, Giustina', 'Destro, Roberta', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Calore, Elisabetta', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Zanesco, Luigi']","['Cesaro S', 'Marson P', 'Gazzola MV', 'De Silvestro G', 'Destro R', 'Pillon M', 'Calore E', 'Messina C', 'Zanesco L']","['Clinic of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy. simone.cesaro@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Cytokines/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Safety', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8 Suppl):35-41.,44,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STATE OF ART: Today, high risk acute leukemia patients are treated at less advanced stages of disease, receive a well-tolerated conditioning regimen, and benefit from advances in post-transplant immunologic reconstitution. Overall, event-free survival and transplant-related mortality compare favorably with those reported for unrelated matched transplants. PERSPECTIVES: T-cell depleted megadose stem cell transplant from a mismatched family member, who is immediately available, can be offered as a viable option to candidates with high-risk acute leukemias.","['Aversa, Franco']",['Aversa F'],"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Section of Hematology, Department of Internal and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy. aversa@unipg.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/05 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/11/05 04:00'],"['2002/11/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8 Suppl):9-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work also led to the identification of the first gene (RAR beta) encoding a receptor for the active derivative of vitamin A, retinoid acid. In collaboration with L. Degos, we then demonstrated the existence a systematic alteration of another retinoic acid receptor, RAR alpha, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Ten such patients were enrolled, seven with multiple myeloma. An escalating regimen of 19-45 GBq of 153Sm lexidronam was added 12-14 days prior to the standard transplantation regimen. Evaluation parameters included time to engraftment, status at day +100 by International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) criteria and toxicity during this period. Absorbed marrow radiation doses were estimated using the MIRDOSE 3 program. No adverse events were attributable to 153Sm lexidronam. Of the seven patients with multiple myeloma, four achieved complete response, two partial response, and another had stable monoclonal band at 3 months post-transplant. One patient with Refractory Anaemic with Excess Blasts in transformation (RAEBt) died of a presumed fungal infection, whilst another with acute myeloid leukaemia relapsed, dying at day +153. A patient with low-grade lymphoma showed no evidence of residual disease at day +100. The total marrow absorbed dose was estimated to be 0.7+/-0.2 mGy x MBq(-1). Regional uptake was markedly non-uniform with poor uptake in the appendicular skeleton. Dose-limiting toxicity was not attained. At the activities used 153Sm lexidronam was not associated with additional toxicity in this population. Adequate absorbed radiation dose to appendicular marrow is unlikely to be deliverable by this approach alone.","['Macfarlane, D J', 'Durrant, S', 'Bartlett, M L', 'Allison, R', 'Morton, A J']","['Macfarlane DJ', 'Durrant S', 'Bartlett ML', 'Allison R', 'Morton AJ']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Queensland, Australia. d.macfarlane@mailbox.uq.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,IM,"['Adult', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organometallic Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006231-200211000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2002 Nov;23(11):1099-106. doi: 10.1097/00006231-200211000-00010.,,,"['0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '745X144DZY (samarium Sm-153 lexidronam)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current DNA-based polymerase chain reactions (PCR) strategies can diagnose monoclonal IgH-R either by measuring the length of the amplicon or by detecting gel mobility variations owing to sequence-dependent conformational changes. However, amplification and analysis remain sequential operations usually requiring manual transfer. We have developed a novel PCR strategy for detecting monoclonal IgH-R that monitors fluorescence of the specific double-stranded DNA binding dye SYBR Green I during melting curve analysis using the LightCycler System. We compared polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) versus melting curve analysis in 130 clinical DNA samples from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues (mostly skin biopsies) of 128 patients. The identical FR3 primers were used to amplify the IgH variable region for both analytic techniques. We detected IgH-R in 24 DNA samples from FFPE tissue of 22 patients. Melting curve analysis, compared to PAGE, revealed no false negative and no false positive results, yielding both sensitivity and specificity equal to 100%. We also compared Southern blot analysis versus melting curve analysis in 23 clinical DNA samples from fresh-frozen lymph nodes of 23 patients. We detected IgH-R by melting curve analysis in 7 DNA samples from fresh-frozen lymph nodes. Melting curve analysis, compared to Southern blot analysis, revealed sensitivity equal to 58.3% (7 of 12) and specificity equal to 100% (11 of 11). We conclude that continuous fluorescence monitoring of PCR products with DNA melting curve analysis can rapidly and reproducibly distinguish polyclonal from monoclonal B-cell populations.","['Xu, Dongsheng', 'Du, Juan', 'Schultz, Cynthia', 'Ali, Ayesha', 'Ratech, Howard']","['Xu D', 'Du J', 'Schultz C', 'Ali A', 'Ratech H']","['Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Biopsy', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Diamines', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organic Chemicals', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quinolines', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60706-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60706-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2002 Nov;4(4):216-22. doi: 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60706-4.,,,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)']",,,,,,PMC1907354,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method to quantify levels of cyclin D1, CD20, and cyclophilin A mRNA in manually microdissected, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using an ABI 7700 qRT-PCR system. The study group included 21 cases of MCL and 37 cases of other types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclin D1 mRNA copy number was normalized to CD20 and cyclophilin A mRNA and evaluated statistically by analysis of variance. The relative cyclin D1 levels were similar whether normalized to CD20 or cyclophilin A, indicating that CD20 levels are stable and can be used as a B-cell-specific normalizer. Statistically significant differences were found in the median levels of cyclin D1 mRNA (expressed as % CD20 mRNA) among cases of MCL (87.6), small lymphocytic lymphoma (9.9), follicular lymphoma (2.4), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (5.9), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (39.8), and Burkitt lymphoma (7.1) (P < 0.05). We conclude that qRT-PCR can be used to quantify cyclin D1 mRNA levels in archival tissue sections. Normalization of cyclin D1 to a B-cell-specific marker more accurately reflects overexpression by MCL than other methods that normalize using constitutively expressed mRNA species.","['Thomazy, Vilmos A', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Uthman, Margaret O', 'Davies, Peter J A', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Thomazy VA', 'Luthra R', 'Uthman MO', 'Davies PJ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas-Houston Medical School, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics', 'Archives', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60704-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60704-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2002 Nov;4(4):201-8. doi: 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60704-0.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",,,,,,PMC1907355,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors investigated the geographic distribution of the incidence of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and other malignancies in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, where HTLV-I is endemic. The world age-standardized incidence rates of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and five cancers of other sites were calculated in 15 areas, using the data from the Nagasaki Prefectural Cancer Registry (1985-97). RESULTS: The incidence of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was found to be positively correlated with that of biliary tract cancer in men (person-years-weighted r = 0.49, P = 0.06) and liver cancer in women (r = 0.56, P = 0.03), but not with cancer of the stomach, lung or cervix uteri. CONCLUSIONS: The results may not support the hypothesis that HTLV-I infection is strongly associated with an increased risk of cancer of the stomach, lung or cervix uteri.

The tetraspanin CD9 has been implicated in cell motility, metastasis, and sperm-egg fusion. In this study we characterize the first CD9 conformation-dependent epitope (detected by monoclonal antibody (mAb) PAINS-13) whose expression depends on changes in the activation state of associated beta(1) integrins. MAb PAINS-13 precipitates CD9 under conditions that preserve the association of this tetraspanin with integrins, but not under conditions that disrupt these interactions. Induction of activation of beta(1) integrins by temperature, divalent cation Mn(2+), or mAb TS2/16 correlated with enhanced expression of the PAINS-13 epitope on a variety of cells. Through the use of different K562 myeloid leukemia transfectant cells expressing specific members of the beta(1) integrin subfamily we show that the expression of the PAINS-13 epitope depends on CD9 association with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin. The mAb PAINS-13 reactivity has been mapped to the CD9 region comprising residues 112-154 in the NH(2) half of the large extracellular loop.

We examined expression of known NF-kappaB/Rel-regulated antiapoptotic genes by RNAse protection assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting in patients with B-CLL. TRAF1 and to a lesser extent TRAF2 were overexpressed in B-CLL lymphocytes as compared with normal CD19(+) B cells. TRAF1 overexpression did not correlate with markers of disease progression or overall survival. Furthermore, we found high constitutive expression of the IAP genes c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, and XIAP both in normal and B-CLL lymphocytes. Focusing on the regulation of TRAF1, NF-kappaB/Rel activity in B-CLL nuclear extracts was shown to bind to TRAF1 promoter elements. However, IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity was not increased in CLL lymphocytes as compared with normal CD19(+) B cells. The known IKK inhibitor sulfasalazine did not compromise TRAF1 expression.

Other clinical studies have investigated the use of TPO in treating chronic nonchemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytopenia due to human immunodeficiency virus, and liver disease. Based solely on animal studies, TPO may be effective in reducing surgical thrombocytopenia and bleeding, ex vivo expansion of pluripotent stem cells, and as a radioprotectant.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the VH mutational status retains its prognostic value in CLL also in the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Therefore, we investigated the mutational status in 58 patients with CLL who underwent myeloablative radiochemotherapy with SCT. Rearranged VH genes were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing using FR1 family-specific primers and JH consensus primers. Twenty patients (34%) showed less than 98% homology compared with germ line VH sequences and were considered as mutated, whereas 38 patients (66%) had an unmutated VH status (median mutational rate of 0%; range, 0%-1.7%). An unmutated VH configuration was strongly correlated with the presence of short lymphocyte doubling time (P =.003) and high lymphocyte count (P =.005). Time to clinical relapse and time to recurrence of monoclonal B cells as assessed by consensus IgH CDR3 PCR was significantly shorter in the group with unmutated VH genes (2-year probability 19% versus 0%, P =.0008, and 34% versus 9%, P =.0006, respectively). These results show that in CLL, an unmutated VH gene status of the tumor clone remains an adverse prognostic factor after SCT. Nevertheless, the hitherto only 3 deaths and the median treatment-free interval of 49 months in the unmutated cohort suggest a beneficial effect of SCT for this high-risk population in comparison to conventional treatment.","['Ritgen, Matthias', 'Lange, Alexandra', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Bretscher, Christian', 'Bosse, Heidi', 'Stuhr, Ariane', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Ritgen M', 'Lange A', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H', 'Bretscher C', 'Bosse H', 'Stuhr A', 'Kneba M', 'Dreger P']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany. m.ritgen@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1744 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50908-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):2049-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1744.

Although many chemokine receptors internalize through clathrin-coated pits, regulation of the receptor trafficking is not fully understood. The present study demonstrated that CXCR2 was colocalized with transferrin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after agonist treatment for different periods of time, suggesting 2 intracellular trafficking pathways for this receptor. CXCR2 was colocalized with Rab5 and Rab11a, which are localized in early and recycling endosomes, respectively, in response to agonist stimulation for a short period of time, suggesting a recycling pathway for the receptor trafficking. However, overexpression of a dominant-negative Rab5-S34N mutant significantly attenuated CXCR2 sequestration. The internalized CXCR2 was recycled back to the cell surface after removal of the agonist and recovery of the cells, but receptor recycling was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative Rab11a-S25N mutant. After prolonged (4-hour) agonist treatment, CXCR2 exhibited significantly increased colocalization with Rab7, which is localized in late endosomes. The colocalization of CXCR2 with LDL and LAMP-1 suggests that CXCR2 is targeted to lysosomes for degradation after prolonged ligand treatment. However, the colocalization of CXCR2 with Lamp1 was blocked by the overexpression of a dominant-negative Rab7-T22N mutant. In cells overexpressing Rab7-T22N, CXCR2 was retained in the Rab5- and Rab11a-positive endosomes after prolonged (4-hour) agonist treatment. Our data suggest that the intracellular trafficking of CXCR2 is differentially regulated by Rab proteins.","['Fan, Guo-Huang', 'Lapierre, Lynne A', 'Goldenring, James R', 'Richmond, Ann']","['Fan GH', 'Lapierre LA', 'Goldenring JR', 'Richmond A']","['Department of Veterans Affairs, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Endosomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/analysis', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transferrin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'rab7 GTP-Binding Proteins']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-1965 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57319-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2115-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-1965.

R115777 was administered at 600 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks every 6 weeks. Seven patients with CML (6 in chronic phase, 1 in advanced phase) achieved complete or partial hematologic response. Four of them had a minor cytogenetic response. Responses were transient, with a median duration of 9 weeks (range, 3-23 weeks). Two patients discontinued therapy because of toxicity while in complete hematologic response. Two MF patients had a significant decrease in splenomegaly, one had normalization of white blood cell count and differential, and one became transfusion independent. One patient with MM had a reduction in monoclonal protein of 34%. Adverse events included nausea in 22 patients (55%; all grade 2 or lower) and fatigue in 19 (48%; grade 3 or higher in 1). Other grade 3 or 4 toxicities included skin rash (4 patients, 10%), peripheral neuropathy (2 patients, 5%), and liver toxicity (2 patients, 5%). Patients who responded to therapy had significantly higher plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations prior to treatment than nonresponders.

Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, induces major cytogenetic remission (MCR) or complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) in the majority of patients with CML in first chronic phase. However, thorough re-evaluation of cytogenetics in a cohort of patients in MCR or CCR demonstrated clonal karyotypic abnormalities in more than 10% of cases, some of which were clinically associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Further analysis identified previous exposure to cytarabine and idarubicin as significant risk factors for the subsequent occurrence of abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) cells. To investigate if cytogenetically normal but clonal hematopoiesis might be present in other patients in cytogenetic remission, we studied X-chromosome inactivation as a marker of clonality by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA). We find that imatinib restores a polyclonal pattern in most patients in CCR and MCR. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the notion that targeted therapy of CML with imatinib favors the manifestation of Ph- clonal disorders in some patients. They indicate that patients on imatinib should be followed with conventional cytogenetics, even after induction of CCR.","['Bumm, Thomas', 'Muller, Christel', 'Al-Ali, Haifa-Kathrin', 'Krohn, Knut', 'Shepherd, Patricia', 'Schmidt, Erika', 'Leiblein, Sabine', 'Franke, Christina', 'Hennig, Evelin', 'Friedrich, Thomas', 'Krahl, Reiner', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Deininger, Michael W N']","['Bumm T', 'Muller C', 'Al-Ali HK', 'Krohn K', 'Shepherd P', 'Schmidt E', 'Leiblein S', 'Franke C', 'Hennig E', 'Friedrich T', 'Krahl R', 'Niederwieser D', 'Deininger MW']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Androgen/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",2002/11/02 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2053 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50892-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1941-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2053.

A treatment strategy using autologous stem cell-targeted gene transfer of a gamma-globin gene may therefore have therapeutic potential. We evaluated oncoretroviral- and lentiviral-based gamma-globin vectors for expression in transduced erythroid cell lines. Compared with gamma-globin, oncoretroviral vectors containing either a beta-spectrin or beta-globin promoter and the alpha-globin HS40 element, a gamma-globin lentiviral vector utilizing the beta-globin promoter and elements from the beta-globin locus control region demonstrated a higher probability of expression. This lentiviral vector design was evaluated in lethally irradiated mice that received transplants of transduced bone marrow cells. Long-term, stable erythroid expression of human gamma-globin was observed with levels of vector-encoded gamma-globin mRNA ranging from 9% to 19% of total murine alpha-globin mRNA. The therapeutic efficacy of the vector was subsequently evaluated in a murine model of beta-thalassemia intermedia. The majority of mice that underwent transplantation expressed significant levels of chimeric m(alpha)(2)h(gamma)(2) molecules (termed HbF), the amount of which correlated with the degree of phenotypic improvement. A group of animals with a mean HbF level of 21% displayed a 2.5 g/dL (25 g/L) improvement in Hb concentration and normalization of erythrocyte morphology relative to control animals. gamma-Globin expression and phenotypic improvement was variably lower in other animals due to differences in vector copy number and chromosomal position effects.

METHODS: Fetal calf serum, serum-free medium and autologous serum were used for culture of DCs. The usage of cytokines was classified into two groups: group A (stem cell factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating-factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4) and group B (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating-factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4). The phenotypes of DCs were analyzed by using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Mixed leukocyte responses were performed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Chromosome analysis of DCs can be achieved by displaying G banding. T cells from CML patients were stimulated with autologous DCs and T-cell cytotoxicity was measured by (MTT) assay. RESULTS: CD34(+) cells or mononuclear cells were obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples of eight patients of chronic-phase CML. Group A of serum-free medium was better than group B in expansion of total cell numbers and the rate of DCs. These results of serum-free medium were not significantly different from those of fetal calf serum medium, but the results of autologous serum medium were inferior to two groups above. The expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen on the surface of DCs was notable (> 50%), but the expression of CD83 and the costimulatory molecules CD86 was not noticeable (10% - 50%). Although CD1a(+)/CD14(-) DCs were potent stimulators of allogeneic lymphocytes, expansion of T cells from normal volunteers were not significant (average 27.2 fold at DCs: T cells ratio of 1:10). At day 12, CD1a(+) cells from three patients were studied by displaying G banding and Ph(+) cells in these populations were 100%, 98% and 60%, respectively. At an effector: target ratio of 40:1, 32% to 45% cytotoxicity was noted with DC-stimulated T cells against autologous leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: A stable serum-free culture system of CML-DCs was established. The expression of CD83 and CD86 on the surface of CML-DCs and DCs' potent stimulation of allogeneic lymphocytes were not notable. DCs in CML patients can be derived from the malignant clone and these malignant DCs could induce anti-leukemic reactivity in autologous T lymphocytes without the necessity for additional exogenous antigens.","['Zhao, Wenli', 'Xing, Peini', 'Wei, Xucang', 'Wang, Tong', 'Yang, Didi', 'Li, Meisheng']","['Zhao W', 'Xing P', 'Wei X', 'Wang T', 'Yang D', 'Li M']","[""Department of Hematology, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China. zhaowmnli@263.net or zhaowenli@X263.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2002/11/02 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/02 04:00'],"['2002/11/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/02 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2002 Sep;115(9):1296-300.,,,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: All 60 patients got sustained engraftment. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurred in 22 patients (36.7%), while the incidence of aGVHD was 48.0% for the CML, 30.0% for the AML and 26.7% for the ALL patients. Thirty-eight patients are still alive in complete remission with a median follow-up of 30 (12 approximately 84) months and 22 died. The main causes of death were aGVHD in 3, CMV-IP in 7, and relapse in 11 patients. The remaining one died of pulmonary infection. Among 11 patients who died of relapse, 8 were ALL relapsed in the early posttransplant stage. All 4 long-term survivors of ALL developed chronic GVHD.

METHODS: Ly49A gene was transfected into spleen cells of C57BL/6 mice by retrovirus and the expression rate of Ly49A receptor was evaluated by flow cytometry. The murine model of haploidentical allogeneic acute GVHD was established by using C57BL/6(H - 2b) mouse as donor, and (BALB/c x C57BL/6) F1(H - 2d/b) (CB(6)F(1)) mouse as the recipient which was injected EL9611 cells before transplantation. After irradiation (TBI, (60)Co 10.5 Gy), the recipient received mixed graft of spleen cells and bone marrow cells to establish a GVHD model. The effects of Ly49A transfected spleen cells on GVHD and GVL post haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were detected with this model. RESULTS: The expression rate of Ly49A receptor was (42.20 +/- 4.87)%, (18.67 +/- 2.48)% and (18.73 +/- 3.82)% for pLXSN-Ly49A, pLXSN transfected and untransfected spleen cells respectively.

METHODS: Between October 1995 and August 2001, fifty-one patients with hematologic malignancies (median age 34 years, range 5.5 approximately 52 years) received allo-PBSCT from HLA-identical (50) or 1-antigen mismatched sibling donors with conditioning regimens of TBI + CY or modified BU/CY2. Thirty-one patients were acute leukemia (AL) (15 in CR(1), 7 in CR(2) or greater, 10 in relapse including 2 relapse after allo-BMT and the other one never achieved remission); 12 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (CP 5, AP 2, BC 4 and relapse after allo-BMT 1); 7 MDS (RAEB 1, RAEB-T 1, AL secondary to MDS 5); Burkitt's lymphoma 1. A combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate was administered for GVHD prophylaxis. RESULT: All patients were engrafted. The median time (range) to neutrophil >/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet >/= 20 x 10(9)/L was 14 (10 approximately 20) and 11 (7 approximately 45) days post-transplant, respectively. Grade II approximately IV acute GVHD occurred in 20/51 (39%) and grade III approximately IV aGVHD in 2 patients. Clinical chronic GVHD was diagnosed in 23 of 44 (52%) evaluable patients. Fourteen patients died: 8 died of transplant related complications, 6 of relapse. Thirty-seven patients are alive with a median follow-up of 399 (75 approximately 2 176) days, and among them 34 are in continuous complete remission, the other 3 relapsed. The 2-year probability of overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse is 64%, 61% and 24%, respectively.

METHODS: Single cell cloning culture, two-way screening, multiple PCR amplification and electrophoresis technique were used. RESULTS: With dose of ENU increasing, cell plating efficiency reduced (in the group with 100-200 micro g/ml doses, P < 0.01) and mutation frequency increased (in the group with 12.5-200.0 micro g/ml doses, P < 0.05) significantly. There was no all exons deletion in spontaneous mutations, and only 7.7% of them were detected as single exon deletion. But, deletion was found in 79.7% of ENU-induced mutations (62.5%-89.4%, P < 0.01), and deletion mutations in all nine exons of HPRT gene. Most of ENU-induced mutations were chain deletion with multiple exons (88.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The spectra in spontaneous mutations differed completely from ENU-induced ones.

The unusually benign behavior of this disease calls into question the validity of grouping such cases under the umbrella of T-PLL and warrants a reconsideration of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (no longer recognized as a distinct disease) as a bona fide diagnostic entity.","['Soma, Lorinda', 'Cornfield, Dennis B', 'Prager, David', 'Nowell, Peter', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Soma L', 'Cornfield DB', 'Prager D', 'Nowell P', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male']",2002/11/01 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10221 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Nov;71(3):224-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10221.,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Am J Hematol. 2003 Oct;74(2):145-7.

Diagnosis of accelerated phase CML was based on karyotypic evolution (n = 9) and hematologic criteria (n = 18). All patients were begun on 600 mg/day of imatinib mesylate. Dose reductions to 400 mg/day and then 300 mg/day were prescribed for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5/microl or a platelet count of <20,000/microl. Twenty-seven of the 28 patients continued treatment for a median of 34 weeks. Eleven patients developed thrombocytopenia following an average of 8.4 +/- 1.4 weeks of therapy. The onset of thrombocytopenia was associated with disease progression in one patient and a decline in bone marrow megakaryocytes in the other 10. Nine patients recovered to a platelet count of >20,000/microl after an average of 19.7 +/- 1.8 weeks. Patients who developed thrombocytopenia had a longer duration of disease (9.39 vs. 4.35 years; P < 0.01) and were more likely to be diagnosed with accelerated phase CML by hematologic criteria. Hematologic responses in patients with and without thrombocytopenia were comparable; however, 31.3% of patients without thrombocytopenia had a complete cytogenetic response compared to none of those with thrombocytopenia.

Immunoregulatory cytokines play a role in the regulation of both autoimmunity and leukemic B-cell growth. Mitogen-stimulated direct antiglobulin test (MS-DAT) is a recently described test able to disclose latent anti-RBC autoimmunity in AIHA. We investigated the prevalence of anti-RBC autoimmunity by MS-DAT and the pattern of cytokine production by PHA-stimulated whole blood cultures from 69 B-CLL patients and 53 controls. Results showed that anti-RBC IgG values in unstimulated, PHA-, PMA-, and PWM-stimulated cultures were significantly higher in B-CLL patients compared with controls. In B-CLL, the prevalence of anti-RBC autoimmunity was 28.9% by MS-DAT, compared with 4.3% by the standard DAT. Production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-13, TNF-alpha, sCD23, and sCD30 was significantly increased in all B-CLL patients compared with controls, whereas there was no difference in IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-beta production. Multivariate analysis showed that IL-4 was significantly increased in MS-DAT-positive compared with -negative patients. Patients with autoantibody positivity displayed greater IFN-gamma production than negative patients. These data are in line with the hypothesis that autoimmune phenomena in B-CLL are associated with an imbalance towards a Th-2-like profile. The elevated prevalence of anti-RBC autoimmunity found by MS-DAT suggests that an underestimated latent autoimmunity exists in B-CLL.","['Barcellini, W', 'Montesano, R', 'Clerici, G', 'Zaninoni, A', 'Imperiali, F G', 'Calori, R', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Zanella, A']","['Barcellini W', 'Montesano R', 'Clerici G', 'Zaninoni A', 'Imperiali FG', 'Calori R', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Zanella A']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Via F.

Expression of a multidrug resistance gene (mdr1) that codes for 170 Kd transmembrane glycoprotein is responsible for conferring resistance to malignant cells to anthracyclines. The t(9:22) translocation, resulting in bcr-abl fusion gene, is commonly found in B-lineage ALL and is known to be a poor prognostic factor for long-term remission. To investigate whether resistance to anthracyclines contributes to poor prognosis in bcr-abl-positive ALL, we studied daunorubicin sensitivity by an in vitro colorimetric methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay in B-lineage ALL patients who were bcr-abl-positive and compared them with the B-lineage, age-matched bcr-abl-negative group. We also looked for and compared the presence of mdr1 gene expression in these two groups of patients by RT-PCR. Of the 46 patients included in the study, 16 (34.7%) were positive for the bcr-abl fusion gene. mdr1 gene expression was seen in 14 of these 46 patients (30.4%). However, the expression of the mdr1 gene was relatively lower in the bcr-abl-positive group (3 out of 16, 18.7%) compared to the bcr-abl-negative group (11 out of 30, 36.6%). The median LD(50) of daunorubicin (concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemic blasts) differed significantly between bcr-abl-positive and -negative patients (P = 0.018). This in vitro study suggests that bcr-abl-positive ALL is relatively resistant to daunorubicin, but this resistance is not mediated through mdr1 gene expression.","['Gupta, Mamta', 'Kumar, Anil', 'Dabadghao, Sunil']","['Gupta M', 'Kumar A', 'Dabadghao S']","['Department of Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', '*Genes, MDR/physiology', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",2002/11/01 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10212 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Nov;71(3):172-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10212.,,,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DENN is identical to MADD (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating death domain), which interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 through their death domains. DENN is also homologous to Rab3 GEP, a rat Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that DENN expression in cancer cell lines was 26-50 times that in normal cells. The Jurkat human leukemia, PLC/PRF/5 human hepatoma, and NS-1 mouse myeloma cell lines as well as the MRC-5 human fetal lung and Vero monkey kidney cell lines were treated successfully with four separate DENN-targeted antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to abrogate DENN expression. Quantitative assessment of cell viability and apoptosis by flow cytometry via fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide membrane-integrity tests, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling, and annexin V assays showed that antisense silencing of DENN resulted in markedly more pronounced cell death in cancer cells compared with nonmalignant cells. Antisense-treated cell lines exhibited extensive loss of DNA content, forming distinct sub-G(1) peaks, while cell proliferation diminished significantly. Ultrastructural features of programmed cell death in cells subjected to antisense ODNs were authenticated by electron microscopy. In contrast, transfection of cell lines with a plasmid construct to achieve DENN overexpression augmented cellular proliferation and could reverse the apoptotic effect of antisense and staurosporine treatment. Our findings suggest that DENN is intimately involved in anti-apoptotic and cell-survival processes.","['Lim, K M', 'Chow, Vincent T K']","['Lim KM', 'Chow VT']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Vero Cells']",2002/11/01 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.10082 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2002 Nov;35(3):110-26. doi: 10.1002/mc.10082.,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (MADD protein, human)', '0 (Madd protein, mouse)', '0 (Madd protein, rat)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF and IGFBP-3 were also expressed in neurofibrillary tangles, as well as in neurons in AD and control brains. Egr-1 was predominantly expressed in astrocytes.

Therefore, Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is a rational therapeutic target in all phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec, Novartis, Basal, Switzerland) produces high rates of complete clinical and cytogenetic responses in the chronic phase, resistance is universal and clinical relapse develops rapidly in the advanced phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. This resistance has been shown to be caused by specific ATP binding site mutations or amplification of Bcr-Abl gene, resulting in a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that is resistant to further inhibition by imatinib. Alternative (Bcr-Abl-independent) mechanisms driving the growth and survival of the malignant clone may also be responsible for imatinib resistance. Novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors that also target Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, or agents that downregulate Bcr-Abl levels regardless of its wild-type or mutant status, may need to be developed clinically for the future therapy of imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Nimmanapalli R', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, University of South Florida, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2002/11/01 04:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200211000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2002 Nov;14(6):616-20. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200211000-00005.,31,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data in breast cancer have demonstrated the ability of microarray-based expression profiling to detect tumor cells in peripheral blood samples, to predict chemotherapy responses in fine-needle aspiration samples in neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and, most importantly, to predict disease-free survival and overall survival from profiles in breast cancer surgical specimens.

Bone marrow cell dose has been reported to be an important factor in alloBMT; however, its true impact on relapse incidence (RI), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in a large cohort of patients is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1992 to December 1999, 572 bone marrow transplantation recipients reported to the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry underwent allografting from an HLA-identical sibling donor with an unmanipulated bone marrow for AML in CR1. RESULTS: The median number of nucleated cells (NCs) infused was 2.6 x 10(8)/kg. Estimated 5-year NRM, LFS, and RI for patients receiving more or less than 2.6 x 10(8) NCs/kg were, respectively, 18% +/- 5% v 30% +/- 5% (P =.001), 68% +/- 3% v 46% +/- 3% (P <.00001), and 14% +/- 4% v 24% +/- 5% (P =.004). The association of cell dose with the above outcomes was confirmed in multivariate analyses for NRM (relative risk [RR], 0.53; P =.0007), for LFS (RR, 0.53; P =.00008), and for RI (RR, 0.57; P =.02). The cell dose was also an important factor for neutrophil (RR, 0.76; P =.009) and platelet (RR, 0.77; P =.03) recoveries; however, it did not statistically influence the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSION: This study shows that marrow cell dose is one of the most important factors influencing relapse, NRM, and LFS after alloBMT for patients with AML in CR1. Therefore, increasing the marrow cell dose should substantially improve the survival of these patients.","['Rocha, Vanderson', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Powles, Ray', 'Arcese, William', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Iriondo, Arturo', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Frassoni, Francesco']","['Rocha V', 'Labopin M', 'Gluckman E', 'Powles R', 'Arcese W', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Reiffers J', 'Iriondo A', 'Ringden O', 'Ruutu T', 'Frassoni F']","[""Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Hopital Saint Louis, and Service d'Hematologie, CHU Saint-Antoine and European Data Management Office, Institut des Cordeliers, Paris, France. vanderson.rocha@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/11/01 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.11.058 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Nov 1;20(21):4324-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.11.058.,,,,,,,,,,['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry'],,,,,,,,,,

Several immune defects, including impaired natural killer activity, depressed IFN-gamma production by T cells stimulated with anti-T cell receptor cross-linking, and increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis infection, were prevented in IL-15 Tg mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to a highly antigenic 10-mer peptide encoded by LP-BM5-defective virus gag p12 gene was detected in the spleen and peritoneal exudate cells from IL-15 Tg mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV. Intramuscular injection of cDNA encoding secretable IL-15 also prevented the development of MAIDS.

RESULTS: In 38 CML patients, 34 (89.5%) were positive, with one having a typical t (9; 22) at first, which changed into negative after having been treated with interferon for 38 months. In another patient, 60 days after post-allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), the cytomorphology and cytogenetics were in completely remission.

Overexpression of uPA and uPAR in cancer tissues is associated with a high incidence of disease recurrence and early death. In agreement with these findings, disruption of the protein-protein interaction between uPAR present on tumor cells and its ligand uPA evolved as an attractive intervention strategy to impair tumor growth and metastasis. For this, the uPAR antagonist cyclo[19,31][D-Cys(19)]-uPA(19)(-)(31) was optimized to efficiently interrupt binding of uPA to cellular uPAR. First, the disulfide bridge of this lead compound was shifted and then the modified peptide was shortened from the amino and carboxy terminus to generate cyclo[21,29][Cys(21,29)]-uPA(21)(-)(30). Next, cyclo[21,29][D-Cys(21)Cys(29)]-uPA(21)(-)(30) was yielded by changing the chirality of Cys(21) to D-Cys(21). For analysis of uPAR binding activity, we employed competitive flow cytofluorometric receptor binding assays, using FITC-uPA as the ligand and U937 promyeloid leukemia cells as the cellular source of uPAR. As demonstrated for cyclo[21,29][D-Cys(21)Cys(29)]-uPA(21)(-)(30), the achieved peptide modifications maintained receptor binding activity (IC(50) = 0.04 microM), which is close in order to that of the parent protein ligand, uPA (IC(50) = 0.01 microM). A detailed NMR analysis with restrained and free molecular dynamics calculations in explicit H(2)O exhibits a well-defined structure with characteristic features such as an omega-loop with two betaI-turns about Lys(3), Tyr(4), Ser(6), and Asn(7). Hydrophobic clustering of the side chains of Tyr(4), Phe(5), Ile(8), and Trp(10) is observed. Side chain mobility is analyzed with time-dependent distance restraints. The NMR structure of cyclo[21,29][D-Cys(21)Cys(29)]-uPA(21)(-)(30) is very similar to the previously reported structure of the amino terminal fragment of uPA. Systematic point mutations led to cyclo[21,29][D-Cys(21)Nle(23)Cys(29)]-uPA(21)(-)(30), which still binds to uPAR but is resistant to proteolytic cleavage, e.g., by the tumor-associated serine proteases uPA and plasmin, and is stable in blood serum or plasma. In conclusion, small cyclic peptides were created, which mimic the structure and activity of the binding epitope of uPA to uPAR and which may serve as novel therapeutic agents in cancer metastasis.","['Schmiedeberg, Niko', 'Schmitt, Manfred', 'Rolz, Christian', 'Truffault, Vincent', 'Sukopp, Martin', 'Burgle, Markus', 'Wilhelm, Olaf G', 'Schmalix, Wolfgang', 'Magdolen, Viktor', 'Kessler, Horst']","['Schmiedeberg N', 'Schmitt M', 'Rolz C', 'Truffault V', 'Sukopp M', 'Burgle M', 'Wilhelm OG', 'Schmalix W', 'Magdolen V', 'Kessler H']","['Institut fur Organische Chemie und Biochemie, Technische Universitat Munchen, Lichtenbergstrasse 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Stability', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Solutions', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism']",2002/11/01 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/11/01 04:00'],"['2002/11/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['jm020254q [pii]', '10.1021/jm020254q [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2002 Nov 7;45(23):4984-94. doi: 10.1021/jm020254q.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Solutions)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in previous years, it was dedicated to the encounter of scientists and clinicians involved in hematopoietic cell transplantation. This year's symposium focused on the characterization of stem cells potentially expanding the use of hematopoietic stem cells and on gene therapy. The immunology section dealt with mechanisms of tolerance, and the characterization of minor histocompatibility antigens presented by major histocompatibility molecules. Further important topics were cytokines and dendritic cells. In 1 and 1/2 days of intense work, the invited speakers, chairmen, authors and an active audience experienced an exciting exchange of ideas and collaboration. Again, new impulses were given for basic research and clinical transplantation. The authors would like to express their deep appreciation and thanks to all participants of this symposium.","['Munker, R', 'Gunther, W', 'Kolb, H J']","['Munker R', 'Gunther W', 'Kolb HJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Louisiana State University, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA. rmunker@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],['Congress'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703690 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Nov;30(9):549-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vectors that have been used for the transduction of CD34(+) cells face the problem of gene silencing when integrated into the genome of repopulating stem cells. We reasoned that a high copy number of retroviral DNA sequences might overcome silencing of transgene expression during expansion and differentiation of progenitor cells into functional DCs. To prove this, we utilized a retroviral vector with bicistronic expression of the melanoma-associated antigen tyrosinase and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Human cord blood CD34(+) cells were transduced with vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) particles using 100-150 multiplicity of infection. During expansion of transduced cells with immature phenotype, transgene expression was strongly silenced, but upon differentiation into mature DCs, residual transgene expression was retained. Intracellular processing of the provirally expressed tyrosinase was tested in a chromium release assay utilizing a cytotoxic T cell clone specific for a HLA-A*0201-restricted tyrosinase peptide. We suggest that retroviral transduction of tumor-associated antigens in hematopoietic progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation into DCs is a suitable basis for the development of potent anti-tumor vaccines.","['Temme, A', 'Morgenroth, A', 'Schmitz, M', 'Weigle, B', 'Rohayem, J', 'Lindemann, D', 'Fussel, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Rieber, E P']","['Temme A', 'Morgenroth A', 'Schmitz M', 'Weigle B', 'Rohayem J', 'Lindemann D', 'Fussel M', 'Ehninger G', 'Rieber EP']","['Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*enzymology/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Melanoma/immunology/therapy', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/*genetics/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/01/03 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2001/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301821 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Nov;9(22):1551-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301821.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, MRD in 72 cases of allogeneic transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia (accelerated phase or blast crisis) was monitored frequently by quantitating the transcript of WT1 gene, a ""panleukemic MRD marker,"" using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Based on the negativity of expression of chimeric genes, the background level of WT1 transcripts in bone marrow following allogeneic transplantation was significantly decreased compared with the level in healthy volunteers. The probability of relapse occurring within 40 days significantly increased step-by-step according to the increase in WT1 expression level (100% for 1.0 x 10(-2)-5.0 x 10(-2), 44.4% for 4.0 x 10(-3)-1.0 x 10(-2), 10.2% for 4.0 x 10(-4)-4.0 x 10(-3), and 0.8% for < 4.0 x 10(-4)) when WT1 level in K562 was defined as 1.0). WT1 levels in patients having relapse increased exponentially with a constant doubling time. The doubling time of the WT1 level in patients for whom the discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents or donor leukocyte infusion was effective was significantly longer than that for patients in whom it was not (P <.05). No patients with a short doubling time of WT1 transcripts (< 13 days) responded to these immunomodulation therapies. These findings strongly suggest that the WT1 assay is very useful for the prediction and management of relapse following allogeneic stem cell transplantation regardless of the presence of chimeric gene markers.","['Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Tamaki, Hiroya', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Soma, Toshihiro', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Kim, Eui Ho', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Murakami, Masaki', 'Fujioka, Tatsuya', 'Masuda, Tomoki', 'Taniguchi, Yuki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Ogawa H', 'Tamaki H', 'Ikegame K', 'Soma T', 'Kawakami M', 'Tsuboi A', 'Kim EH', 'Hosen N', 'Murakami M', 'Fujioka T', 'Masuda T', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Nishida S', 'Oji Y', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. ogachan@ceres.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1831 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50857-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1698-704. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1831.

CD38 expression and IgV(H) gene mutational status are independent predictors of prognosis, but their relationships and the CD38 cutoff level are unknown. Using cytofluorography, we analyzed CD38 in 148 patients, in 108 of whom we were able to evaluate IgV(H) mutations, make correlations with disease history, and assess cumulative survival. Three different patient groups were identified by the CD38 expression pattern: a group homogeneously CD38(-), a group homogeneously CD38(+), and a group characterized by a bimodal profile, because of the concomitant presence of variable proportions of 2 distinct populations, one CD38(+) and one CD38(-). In CD38 bimodal expression patients the CD38(+) subset was significantly more represented in the bone marrow than in the peripheral blood. For IgV(H) mutations, 11.4% of CD38(-), 84.6% of CD38(+), and 68.0% of CD38 bimodal expression patients had no mutation. CD38 expression, IgV(H) mutational status, and traditional prognostic factors were concordant. The progression rate was 12.9% for CD38(-), 75.0% for CD38(+), and 63.3% for CD38 bimodal expression patients. Only 25.8% of the CD38(-) patients but 63.3% of the bimodal and 75.0% of CD38(+) patients were treated. The presence of a CD38(+) population, albeit small, correlated with the development of autoimmune manifestations. The CD38(-) group has not yet reached the median survival, which is 183 months in the CD38(+) group and 156 months in the CD38 bimodal expression group, regardless of the size of the CD38(+) population. The presence of a distinct CD38(+) population within the leukemic clone, rather than a numerical cutoff definition, correlates with IgV(H) gene mutational status and, irrespective of its size, identifies CLL patients who will have progressive disease.","['Ghia, Paolo', 'Guida, Giuseppe', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Gottardi, Daniela', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Strola, Giuliana', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Ghia P', 'Guida G', 'Stella S', 'Gottardi D', 'Geuna M', 'Strola G', 'Scielzo C', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1801 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57385-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1262-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1801.

One exception is cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), to which infant ALL cells are highly sensitive. To investigate the mechanism underlying Ara-C sensitivity in infants with ALL, mRNA levels of Ara-C-metabolizing enzymes were measured in infants (n = 18) and older children (noninfants) with ALL (n = 24). In the present study, infant ALL cells were 3.3-fold more sensitive to Ara-C (P =.007) and accumulated 2.3-fold more Ara-CTP (P =.011) upon exposure to Ara-C, compared with older children with ALL. Real-time quantitative reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (TaqMan) revealed that infants express 2-fold less of the Ara-C phosphorylating enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mRNA (P =.026) but 2.5-fold more mRNA of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), responsible for Ara-C membrane transport (P =.001). The mRNA expression of pyrimidine nucleotidase I (PN-I), cytidine deaminase (CDA), and deoxycytidylate deaminase (dCMPD) did not differ significantly between both groups. hENT1 mRNA expression inversely correlated with in vitro resistance to Ara-C (r(s) = -0.58, P =.006). The same differences concerning dCK and hENT1 mRNA expression were observed between MLL gene-rearranged (n = 14) and germ line MLL cases (n = 25). An oligonucleotide microarray screen (Affymetrix) comparing patients with MLL gene-rearranged ALL with those with nonrearranged ALL also showed a 1.9-fold lower dCK (P =.001) and a 2.7-fold higher hENT1 (P =.046) mRNA expression in patients with MLL gene-rearranged ALL. We conclude that an elevated expression of hENT1, which transports Ara-C across the cell membrane, contributes to Ara-C sensitivity in MLL gene-rearranged infant ALL.","['Stam, Ronald W', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Ebus, Marli E G', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Noordhuis, Paul', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stam RW', 'den Boer ML', 'Meijerink JP', 'Ebus ME', 'Peters GJ', 'Noordhuis P', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Armstrong SA', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Pieters R']","[""University Hospital Rotterdam/Sophia Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, The Netherlands. stam@kgk.fgg.eur.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'DCMP Deaminase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Pyrimidine Nucleotides/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1600 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57386-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1270-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1600.

We show that DNR increased phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) and stimulated activities of both Raf-1 and extracellular-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) within 10 to 30 minutes in U937 cells. ERK1 stimulation was completely blocked by either the mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 or the Raf-1 inhibitor 8-bromo-cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate). However, only partial inhibition of Raf-1 and ERK1 stimulation was observed with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac). Moreover, the xanthogenate compound D609 that inhibits DNR-induced phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis and subsequent diacylglycerol (DAG) production, as well as wortmannin that blocks phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) stimulation, only partially inhibited Raf-1 and ERK1 stimulation. We also observed that DNR stimulated protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta), an atypical PKC isoform, and that both D609 and wortmannin significantly inhibited DNR-triggered PKCzeta activation. Finally, we found that the expression of PKCzeta kinase-defective mutant resulted in the abrogation of DNR-induced ERK phosphorylation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that DNR activates the classical Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway and that Raf-1 activation is mediated through complex signaling pathways that involve at least 2 contributors: PC-derived DAG and PI3K products that converge toward PKCzeta.

C/EBPalpha(-/-) mice show a block in hematopoietic differentiation, with an accumulation of myeloblasts and an absence of mature granulocytes, whereas expression of C/EBPalpha in leukemia cell lines leads to granulocytic differentiation. Recently, dominant-negative mutations in the C/EBPalpha gene and down-regulation of C/EBPalpha by AML1-ETO, an AML associated fusion protein, have been identified in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). To better understand the role of C/EBPalpha in the lineage commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors, we transduced primary human CD34(+) cells with a retroviral construct that expresses the C/EBPalpha cDNA fused in-frame with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain. Induction of C/EBPalpha function in primary human CD34(+) cells, by the addition of beta-estradiol, leads to granulocytic differentiation and inhibits erythrocyte differentiation. Using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) oligonucleotide arrays we have identified C/EBPalpha target genes in primary human hematopoietic cells, including granulocyte-specific genes that are involved in hematopoietic differentiation and inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1), a transcriptional repressor known to interfere with erythrocyte differentiation. Given the known differences in murine and human promoter regulatory sequences, this inducible system allows the identification of transcription factor target genes in a physiologic, human hematopoietic progenitor cell background.","['Cammenga, Jorg', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Berguido, Francisco J', 'MacGrogan, Donal', 'Viale, Agnes', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Cammenga J', 'Mulloy JC', 'Berguido FJ', 'MacGrogan D', 'Viale A', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/deficiency/*genetics/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transfection']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1546 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57333-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2206-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1546.

Remission induction with imatinib alone would seem ideal because it is less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. Conversely, patients unlikely to respond may benefit from combination therapy up front. To identify prognostic factors, we studied the mRNA expression of genes related to drug resistance and apoptosis in leukemic cells from patients with M-BC and their in vitro sensitivity to imatinib, and analyzed the results with other baseline factors for their impact on response.

To investigate which mechanisms operate in these crosstalks and whether they are malignancy-related or reproduce the mechanisms used by normal B cells we have studied the expression and functional role of semaphorin CD100 (now called Sema4D) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and normal CD5+ B cells. We demonstrate here that (1) leukemic and normal CD5+ B lymphocytes uniformly express CD100; (2) the CD100 high-affinity receptor Plexin-B1 is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, follicular dendritic cells, and activated T lymphocytes, and is thus available to CD100+ lymphocytes in different specific microenvironments; and (3) upon interaction between CD100 and Plexin-B1 both CLL and normal CD5+ B cells increase their proliferative activity and extend their life span. These findings establish that Plexin-B1 is an easily accessible receptor for CD100 within the immune system. The encounter of CD100+ leukemic cells with Plexin-B1 may promote the proliferation and survival of malignant cells.

These mutations occur in the juxtamembrane (FLT3 length mutations; FLT3-LMs) and the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3-TKD and confer interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells. In the mouse bone marrow transplantation model, FLT3-LMs induce a myeloproliferative syndrome stressing their transforming activity in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic potential of FLT3 in FLT3-LM/TKD-mutation-transformed Ba/F3 cells and AML-derived cell lines. The PTK inhibitor SU5614 has inhibitory activity for FLT3 and selectively induces growth arrest, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in Ba/F3 and AML cell lines expressing a constitutively activated FLT3. In addition, the compound reverts the antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative activity of FLT3 ligand (FL) in FL-dependent cells. No cytotoxic activity of SU5614 was found in leukemic cell lines that express a nonactivated FLT3 or no FLT3 protein. At the biochemical level, SU5614 down-regulated the activity of the hyperphosphorylated FLT3 receptor and its downstream targets, signal transducer and activator of (STAT) 3, STAT5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the STAT5 target genes BCL-X(L) and p21. Our results show that SU5614 is a PTK inhibitor of FLT3 and has antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in AML-derived cell lines that endogenously express an activated FLT3 receptor. The selective and potent cytotoxicity of FLT3 PTK inhibitors support a clinical strategy of targeting FLT3 as a new molecular treatment option for patients with FLT3-LM/TKD-mutation(+) AML.","['Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Dirschinger, Ralf J', 'Schwab, Ruth', 'Bagrintseva, Ksenia', 'Faber, Florian', 'Buske, Christian', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kelly, Louise M', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Spiekermann K', 'Dirschinger RJ', 'Schwab R', 'Bagrintseva K', 'Faber F', 'Buske C', 'Schnittger S', 'Kelly LM', 'Gilliland DG', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany. spiekermann@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1045 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57417-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1494-504. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1045.

To test the proposed hypothesis that HOXB4 could become a prime tool for in vivo expansion of genetically modified human HSCs, we retrovirally overexpressed HOXB4 in purified cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells together with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter protein, and evaluated the impact of ectopic HOXB4 expression on proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When injected separately into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice or in competition with control vector-transduced cells, HOXB4-overexpressing cord blood CD34+ cells had a selective growth advantage in vivo, which resulted in a marked enhancement of the primitive CD34+ subpopulation (P =.01). However, high HOXB4 expression substantially impaired the myeloerythroid differentiation program, and this was reflected in a severe reduction of erythroid and myeloid progenitors in vitro (P <.03) and in vivo (P =.01). Furthermore, HOXB4 overexpression also significantly reduced B-cell output (P <.01).

In peripheral blood B cells that had been activated with helper T cells (murine thymoma EL-4 B5) and cytokines, multiply attenuated HIV-1-derived vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G-envelope protein achieved the expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) in 27% +/- 12% (mean +/- 1 SD; median, 27%) of B cells in different experiments. When compared in parallel cultures, the transducibility of B cells from different donors exhibited little variation. The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter gave 4- to 6-fold higher GFP expression than did the human elongation factor-1alpha promoter. A murine retroviral vector pseudotyped with VSV G protein proved inefficient even in mitotically active primary B cells. B cells freshly stimulated with Epstein-Barr virus were also transducible by HIV vectors (24% +/- 9%), but B cells activated with CD40 ligand and cytokines resisted transduction. Thus, different culture systems gave different results. Freshly isolated, nondividing myeloma cells were efficiently transduced by HIV vectors; for 6 myelomas the range was 14% to 77% (median, 28%) GFP(+) cells. HIV vectors with a mutant integrase led to no significant GFP signal in primary B or myeloma cells, suggesting that vector integration was required for high transduction. In conclusion, HIV vectors are promising tools for studies of gene functions in primary human B cells and myeloma cells for the purposes of research and the development of gene therapies.","['Bovia, Fabrice', 'Salmon, Patrick', 'Matthes, Thomas', 'Kvell, Krisztian', 'Nguyen, Tuan H', 'Werner-Favre, Christiane', 'Barnet, Marc', 'Nagy, Monika', 'Leuba, Florence', 'Arrighi, Jean-Francois', 'Piguet, Vincent', 'Trono, Didier', 'Zubler, Rudolf H']","['Bovia F', 'Salmon P', 'Matthes T', 'Kvell K', 'Nguyen TH', 'Werner-Favre C', 'Barnet M', 'Nagy M', 'Leuba F', 'Arrighi JF', 'Piguet V', 'Trono D', 'Zubler RH']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Genes, rev', 'Genes, tat', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV Integrase/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*virology', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-12-0249 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50862-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1727-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-12-0249.

Within the bone marrow, erythroblasts surround central macrophages forming erythroblastic islands. Evidence suggests that these islands are highly specialized subcompartments where cell adhesion events, in concert with cytokines, play critical roles in regulating erythropoiesis and apoptosis. Since erythroblasts express alpha4beta1 and ICAM-4 and macrophages exhibit alphaV, ICAM-4 is an attractive candidate for mediating cellular interactions within erythroblastic islands. To determine whether ICAM-4 binding properties are conserved across species, we first cloned and sequenced the murine homologue. The translated amino acid sequence showed 68% overall identity with human ICAM-4. Using recombinant murine ICAM-4 extracellular domains, we discovered that hematopoietic alpha4beta1- expressing HEL cells and nonhematopoietic alphaV-expressing FLY cells adhered to mouse ICAM-4. Cell adhesion studies showed that FLY and HEL cells bound to mouse and human proteins with similar avidity. These data strongly suggest conservation of integrin-binding properties across species. Importantly, we characterized a novel second splice cDNA that would be predicted to encode an ICAM-4 isoform, lacking the membrane-spanning domain. Erythroblasts express both isoforms of ICAM-4. COS-7 cells transfected with green flourescent protein constructs of prototypic or novel ICAM-4 cDNA showed different cellular localization patterns. Moreover, analysis of tissue culture medium revealed that the novel ICAM-4 cDNA encodes a secreted protein. We postulate that secretion of this newly described isoform, ICAM-4S, may modulate binding of membrane-associated ICAM-4 and could thus play a critical regulatory role in erythroblast molecular attachments.","['Lee, Gloria', 'Spring, Frances A', 'Parsons, Stephen F', 'Mankelow, Tosti J', 'Peters, Luanne L', 'Koury, Mark J', 'Mohandas, Narla', 'Anstee, David J', 'Chasis, Joel Anne']","['Lee G', 'Spring FA', 'Parsons SF', 'Mankelow TJ', 'Peters LL', 'Koury MJ', 'Mohandas N', 'Anstee DJ', 'Chasis JA']","['Life Sciences Division, University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2529 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50870-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1790-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2529.

Unfortunately, alloSCT is frequently limited by toxicity, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and has not been successful in the treatment of tumors derived from solid organs. Here we report a novel cooperation between host and donor T cells in the response to a tumor cell vaccine given after a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NST) protocol that achieves stable mixed bone marrow chimerism. Treatment of animals with NST, posttransplantation donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), and a vaccine, comprising irradiated autologous tumor cells mixed with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-producing bystander line, results in potent and specific antitumor immunity. This combined modality immunotherapy, administered after surgical removal of the primary tumor, cured metastatic mammary cancer in most animals without inducing GVHD. Cured animals contained tumor-specific T cells of both host and donor origin, but immunodeficient hosts could not be cured by NST, DLI, and vaccine administration. Thus, transfer of allogeneic donor T cells may help break functional tolerance of a host immune system to a solid tumor, thereby providing a rationale for the generation of mixed hematopoietic chimerism by NST prior to tumor cell vaccination.","['Luznik, Leo', 'Slansky, Jill E', 'Jalla, Sanju', 'Borrello, Ivan', 'Levitsky, Hyam I', 'Pardoll, Drew M', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J']","['Luznik L', 'Slansky JE', 'Jalla S', 'Borrello I', 'Levitsky HI', 'Pardoll DM', 'Fuchs EJ']","['Divisions of Hematopoiesis/Immunology and Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2233 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57437-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1645-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2233.

VL30 promoter elements were isolated from ELM-I-1 erythroid progenitor cells upon erythropoietin (epo) treatment.

In the present study we demonstrate that expression of HHV8 vFLIP in a growth factor-dependent TF-1 leukemia cell line protects against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Unlike vector-expressing cells, those expressing HHV8 vFLIP maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential upon withdrawal from growth factor and also exhibit a block in the activation of caspases. The protective effect of HHV8 vFLIP is associated with its ability to activate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and is missing in the vFLIP encoded by equine herpes virus 2 that lacks this activity. Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway by IkappaB superrepressor, lactacystin, MG132, arsenic trioxide, and phenylarsine oxide reverse the protection against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis conferred by HHV8 vFLIP. HHV8 vFLIP up-regulates the expression of Bcl-x(L), an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family, which is a known target of the NF-kappaB pathway. Collectively, the above results suggest that HHV8 vFLIP-induced NF-kappaB activation may contribute to cellular transformation seen in association with HHV8 infection by preventing the apoptosis of cells destined to die because of growth factor deprivation.","['Sun, Qinmiao', 'Matta, Hittu', 'Chaudhary, Preet M']","['Sun Q', 'Matta H', 'Chaudhary PM']","['Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research and Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-8593, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rhadinovirus/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2072 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50894-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1956-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2072.

Germline mutations in gene TP53 are identified in a percentage of affected families. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eight families with aggregation of childhood sarcomas, brain tumors, breast cancers in pre-menopausal women, and renal tumors were screened for TP53 germ-line mutations. SSCP and posterior direct sequencing were performed for genetic analysis. We also report a previously undescribed family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome carrying a germline mutation. RESULTS: Seven families fulfilled so-called Li-Fraumeni like criteria and one fulfilled classical criteria. A new germ-line mutation in codon 238 at exon 7 of the gene TP53 was identified in the family fulfilling classical criteria. This mutation has not been previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical heterogeneity as well as the molecular complexity and consequences of mutation analysis and genetic counseling make it necessary to develop protocols in this area. A multidisciplinary approach is needed; this approach should be coordinated by a Familial Cancer Genetic Counseling Unit.","['Balmana, Judith', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Diez, Orland', 'Sabate, Josep Maria', 'Balil, Anna', 'Pericay, Carles', 'Lopez Lopez, Juan Jose', 'Brunet, Joan', 'Baiget, Montse', 'Alonso, Carmen']","['Balmana J', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Diez O', 'Sabate JM', 'Balil A', 'Pericay C', 'Lopez Lopez JJ', 'Brunet J', 'Baiget M', 'Alonso C']","['Servicio de Oncologia Medica, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Espana. jbalmana@hsp.santpau.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/05/31 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(02)73474-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7753(02)73474-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2002 Oct 19;119(13):497-9. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7753(02)73474-x.,,Descripcion de una nueva mutacion germinal en el gen TP53 en una familia con sindrome de Li-Fraumeni.

In the present study, we compared the significance of IL-15 and IL-2 in growth of ATL cells and clinical aggressiveness. Thirty-seven patients with ATL were examined: 19 acute and 18 chronic. Autonomous growth and IL-2- or IL-15-responsive growth activities of ATL cells were measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation after 24 h cultures in vitro. All of the autonomous, IL-15- and IL-2-responsive growth activities of acute-type cells were higher than those of chronic type (P = 0.04, P = 0.03 and P = 0.02 respectively). IL-15- and IL-2-responsive growth activities were highly correlated (P = 0.0001, R2 = 0.837). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed detectable serum levels of IL-15 and IL-2 in 18 out of 19 and 14 out of 17 patients respectively. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed IL-15 and IL-2 mRNA expression in 8 out of 11 patients' cells. Anti-IL-2 antibody partially inhibited autonomous growth of ATL cells; anti-IL-15 antibody was less effective. In situ immunochemistry detected IL-15 in cells of three patients and was consistent with the results of RT-PCR. These results suggest that ATL cells grow in an IL-15 autocrine/paracrine manner and that this growth is related to disease aggressiveness in a manner similar to IL-2.","['Kukita, Toshimasa', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Matsushita, Kakushi', 'Arimura, Kosei', 'Ohtsubo, Hideo', 'Sakaki, Yoshimune', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Ozaki, Atsuo', 'Matsumoto, Tadashi', 'Tei, Chuwa']","['Kukita T', 'Arima N', 'Matsushita K', 'Arimura K', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Sakaki Y', 'Fujiwara H', 'Ozaki A', 'Matsumoto T', 'Tei C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-15/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paracrine Communication', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/10/31 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['3813 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03813.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Nov;119(2):467-74. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03813.x.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers complementary to ETV6 and ABL2, two ETV6-ABL2 fusion transcripts were identified in MT-ALL which resulted from alternative splicing of an ABL2 exon. The fusion transcripts code for putative ETV6-ABL2 fusion proteins containing the pointed domain of ETV6 and almost the complete ABL2 protein, including the SH2, SH3 domains and the protein tyrosine kinase domain (PTK). Identical ETV6-ABL2 fusion transcripts have been reported in an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) M3 cell line, carrying both a t(15;17)(q22;q21) and a t(1;12)(q25;p13) with unusual inducible differentiation to eosinophils, and in a patient with AML-M4eo.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in childhood Ph+ ALL prospectively enrolled in an intensive, Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-type treatment protocol. Twenty-seven of 36 (75.0%) Ph+ patients consecutively enrolled into the high-risk group of the AIEOP-ALL protocol between May 1995 and October 1999 were successfully analysed. Twenty were good responders to the pre-phase of prednisone/intrathecal methotrexate treatment (PGR) and seven were poor responders (PPR). Within the PPR group, the RT-PCR monitoring constantly showed positivity for the BCR/ABL fusion transcript and all the patients died of disease progression. In contrast, highly sensitive qualitative RT-PCR monitoring revealed heterogeneity within the PGR group of Ph+ childhood ALL patients. Three different subgroups could be defined, according to the clearance of Ph+ cells within the first 5 months of treatment.

Secondary objectives were defined as the tolerability and feasibility of rituximab in patients with CLL. METHODS: Twenty-four heavily pretreated patients with CLL were treated with a standard dose of 375 mg m-2 of rituximab given once weekly for four doses. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 35% and all the responses were partial as defined by the revised NCI criteria. In 17 (85%) of 20 patients with initially measurable peripheral lymph nodes the size of lymph nodes decreased by at least 50%, while an improvement of the bone marrow infiltration was observed only in two (11%) of 18 evaluable patients. The median duration of the overall response was 12.5 wk. Rituximab was relatively well tolerated. Although side-effects were common (75%) they were usually mild or moderate. There was only one grade 3 adverse event and no grade 4 events. CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose rituximab has activity in heavily pretreated patients with CLL, although the response is mainly limited to the lymph nodes and of short duration. Since rituximab has in vitro synergism with chemotherapeutic agents and is well tolerated by CLL patients, it is reasonable to investigate rituximab in combination with other treatments.","['Itala, M', 'Geisler, C H', 'Kimby, E', 'Juvonen, E', 'Tjonnfjord, G', 'Karlsson, K', 'Remes, K']","['Itala M', 'Geisler CH', 'Kimby E', 'Juvonen E', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Karlsson K', 'Remes K']","['Haematological Departments of Turku University Hospital, Finland; Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. maija.itala@tyks.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/31 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['2o786 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02786.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Sep;69(3):129-34. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02786.x.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested that human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) may be involved in the development of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma. We analysed 31 patients with primary gastric T-cell lymphoma in south-west Japan, an area endemic for HTLV-1, and determined their phenotypes, genotypes, and HTLV-1 status. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present 31 cases of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma in a HTLV-1-endemic area in Japan and analyse the clinical status, histology, phenotype and virus status. The median age at onset of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma was 57 years with a gender ratio of M:F = 1.58:1. Six of the 31 primary gastric T-cell lymphoma cases had HTLV-1 proviral DNA (five males, one female), nine of the 31 cases were positive for anti-adult T cell leukaemia antibody, without examination of HTLV-1 proviral DNA (five males, four females), eight were non-HTLV-1-associated primary gastric T-cell lymphoma (four males, four females) and the other eight cases were unknown. Primary gastric T-cell lymphoma usually presented as a large ulcerated tumour at the corpus to the antrum and histologically consisted of anaplastic large cell type (n = 2), pleomorphic large cell type (n = 3), pleomorphic medium and large cell type (n = 14), pleomorphic medium cell type (n = 11), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma type (n = 1). There were no clear macroscopic and microscopic differences between HTLV-1-associated and non-HTLV-1-associated primary gastric T-cell lymphoma. Most patients died within 2 years of diagnosis, and both types of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma (with and without HTLV-1) were associated with poor prognosis. Cytotoxic marker analysis showed that HTLV-1-associated lymphomas were negative for TIA-1, while non-HTLV-1-associated lymphomas were positive for TIA-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in HTLV-1-endemic areas, patients with HTLV-1-associated primary gastric T-cell lymphoma should be managed carefully and that TIA-1 seems to be useful for identifying the aetiology of this lesion.","['Hatano, B', 'Ohshima, K', 'Katoh, A', 'Kanda, M', 'Kawasaki, C', 'Tsuchiya, T', 'Shimazaki, K', 'Haraoka, S', 'Sugihara, M', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Hatano B', 'Ohshima K', 'Katoh A', 'Kanda M', 'Kawasaki C', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Shimazaki K', 'Haraoka S', 'Sugihara M', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M']","['First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['1459 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2002.01459.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2002 Nov;41(5):421-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2002.01459.x.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased levels in urine, serum, plasma, or malignant tissue have been associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with solid tumors. METHODS: The authors used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure VEGF and bFGF levels in plasma samples from 99 patients with previously untreated myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (n = 41 patients; 42%) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 58 patients; 58%) and compared the results with the results from a group of normal control participants. RESULTS: Increased expression levels of VEGF and bFGF were found in the plasma from patients with AML and MDS (P < 0.01) compared with the levels found in the control group. Plasma levels of VEGF in patients with AML or MDS were similar (median, 30.63 pg/mL and 34.41 pg/mL, respectively). There was no significant difference in bFGF levels between patients with AML and patients with MDS (median, 6.38 pg/mL and 6.98 pg/mL, respectively). Elevated levels of VEGF were associated with reduced survival (P = 0.02) in patients with AML as well as lower complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.004). Elevated VEGF levels were not associated with reduced remission duration (CRD) in patients with AML. There was no correlation between VEGF levels and survival, CRD, or CR rates in patients with MDS. There was no correlation between bFGF levels and CR rates or survival in patients with either AML or MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma VEGF levels have prognostic significance in patients with AML.

METHODS: By using Swedish population-based inpatient and cancer registry data, we followed-up 12,000 subjects with CD or DH, and evaluated cancer incidence by using standardized incidence ratios (SIR). RESULTS: Adults (but not children and adolescents) with CD had an elevated overall risk for cancer (SIR = 1.3) that declined with time and eventually reached unity. Elevated risks were found for malignant lymphomas, small-intestinal, oropharyngeal, esophageal, large intestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic carcinomas. The excess occurrence of malignant lymphomas was confined to adults, decreased with time of follow-up evaluation, and decreased over successive calendar periods. Decreased risks were found for breast cancer. Subjects with DH had a slightly increased overall cancer risk (SIR = 1.2) owing to excesses of malignant lymphoma and leukemia, but no increases of gastrointestinal carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: Albeit increased, the relative risks for lymphomas and gastrointestinal cancers in this study are lower (and declining) than in most previous reports. The overall cancer risk is only moderately increased, and nonelevated during childhood and adolescence.","['Askling, Johan', 'Linet, Martha', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Halstensen, Trond S', 'Ekstrom, Karin', 'Ekbom, Anders']","['Askling J', 'Linet M', 'Gridley G', 'Halstensen TS', 'Ekstrom K', 'Ekbom A']","['Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute/Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. johan.askling@medks.ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Celiac Disease/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis Herpetiformis/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Distribution', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2002/10/31 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0016508502002755 [pii]', '10.1053/gast.2002.36585 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2002 Nov;123(5):1428-35. doi: 10.1053/gast.2002.36585.,,,,,['Gastroenterology. 2002 Nov;123(5):1726-9.

Although HPS represents a secondary phenomenon, it can mask the underlying condition, generally a neoplastic or infective disease, thus making the patient management rather difficult. The aims of this study were to point out the main pathological features useful to highlight the primary disease and show the eventual discrepancies among the different cases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone-marrow biopsies (BMBs) of 26 patients with HPS were morphologically and immunophenotypically evaluated; the patients were 12 females and 14 males with mean age of 45.8 years (range 18-80 years). Fifteen patients had a hematological neoplasia either at onset (13 cases) or relapse (2 cases); 5 patients had evidence of active infection immediately prior to HPS development, whereas in 6 patients no definite etiology was established. Cases were therefore divided into neoplasia related, infection related, and ""idiopathic"". In all cases BMB showed marked histiocyte hyperplasia with hemophagocytosis. In cases of bone-marrow lymphoma or leukemia involvement, immunohistochemistry allowed diagnosis of the underlying disease to be made; infection-related cases showed a reactive marrow with mature interstitial T-lymphoid infiltration, whereas in idiopathic cases T-cells were mainly aggregated in small clusters. In no cases were significant percentages of natural-killer (NK) cells detected. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although no strict morphological or immunophenotypical criteria able to allow an immediate diagnosis of underlying disease were pointed out, in most cases BMB proved to be an essential and reliable diagnostic tool. According to our experience, when HPS occurs, the first diagnosis to investigate is a neoplastic disease which sometimes can be latent or hidden.","['Florena, Ada Maria', 'Iannitto, Emilio', 'Quintini, Gerlando', 'Franco, Vito']","['Florena AM', 'Iannitto E', 'Quintini G', 'Franco V']","['Istituto di Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Policlinico P.Giaccone, Universita degli Studi di Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127 Palermo, Italy. amflorena@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Histiocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Virus Diseases/complications/metabolism/pathology']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00428-002-0661-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2002 Oct;441(4):335-44. doi: 10.1007/s00428-002-0661-6.

To better define the relationship between these cell lineages, we have generated knock-in embryonic stem (ES) cells carrying a non-functional human CD4 at the Scl locus. By using in vitro differentiated Scl(+/CD4) ES cells, we demonstrate that FLK1 and SCL are molecular determinants of the hemangioblast. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that hematopoietic and endothelial cells develop via distinct, sequential generation of FLK1 and SCL-expressing cells. FLK1(+)CD4(-) cells first arise in developing embryoid bodies. The Scl gene is turned on within FLK1(+)CD4(-) cells to give rise to FLK1(+)CD4(+) cells. Alternatively, a subpopulation of the initial FLK1(+)CD4(-) cells remains as SCL negative. Within the FLK1(+)CD4(+) cells, FLK1 is down regulated to generate FILK1(-)CD4(+) cells. Replating studies demonstrate that hematopoietic progenitors are enriched within FLK1(+)CD4(+) and FLK1(-)CD4(+) cells, while endothelial cells develop from FLK1(+)CD4(+) and FLK1(+)CD4(-) cell populations.","['Chung, Yun Shin', 'Zhang, Wen Jie', 'Arentson, Elizabeth', 'Kingsley, Paul D', 'Palis, James', 'Choi, Kyunghee']","['Chung YS', 'Zhang WJ', 'Arentson E', 'Kingsley PD', 'Palis J', 'Choi K']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endothelium/*growth & development/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/10/31 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/10/31 04:00'],"['2002/10/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/dev.00149 [doi]'],ppublish,Development. 2002 Dec;129(23):5511-20. doi: 10.1242/dev.00149.,,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,"['HL59484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL63736/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photosensitizing agent capronyloxy-tetrakis methyloxyethyl porphycene (CPO) was selected from a group of sensitizers previously shown to target the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 for photodamage. Like PDT with CPO, HA14-1 caused the rapid activation of procaspase-3, followed by the appearance of an apoptotic morphology within 60 min. Caspase activation after a sublethal dose of either PDT or HA14-1 was enhanced by staurosporine or the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid. Moreover, PDT promoted procaspase activation and lethality of HA14-1 and vice versa. Effects of PDT versus HA14-1 could not be distinguished on the basis of the reactive oxygen species formation. Both caused the rapid oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein.

Our results provide the first evidence of a functional relationship between PML and a checkpoint kinase in gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis.","['Yang, Shutong', 'Kuo, Christin', 'Bisi, John E', 'Kim, Myung K']","['Yang S', 'Kuo C', 'Bisi JE', 'Kim MK']","['Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', '*Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electroporation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells']",2002/10/29 04:00,2004/04/15 05:00,['2002/10/29 04:00'],"['2002/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ncb869 [doi]', 'ncb869 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2002 Nov;4(11):865-70. doi: 10.1038/ncb869.,,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,['Nat Cell Biol. 2002 Nov;4(11):E255-6.

Total RNA samples could be reverse transcribed into cDNA and used successfully in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of B2M transcripts in 68 of 71 cases.

The bone marrow shows expansion of neutrophilic granulopoiesis, without excess of myeloblasts. To date, only 129 cases of CNL have been reported in the literature. AIMS: To report the findings from a large group of 14 new cases of CNL, consisting of eight women and six men (mean age, 64.7 years). METHODS: A review of the 14 new cases of CNL and the investigation of BCR/ABL translocations in these patients. RESULTS: Three quarters of the patients died within two years after diagnosis, mostly as a result of severe cerebral haemorrhage. Two younger patients were successfully treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or interferon, which resulted in haematological remission for years. CONCLUSION: CNL is a rare myeloproliferative disease mostly taking a fatal clinical course, despite the presence of mature neutrophils as leukaemic cells in the blood. Thus, it is important to recognise CNL to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for affected patients.","['Bohm, J', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Bohm J', 'Schaefer HE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Freiburg, Medical School, Freiburg, Germany. jboehm@ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2002/10/29 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/10/29 04:00'],"['2002/10/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.55.11.862 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2002 Nov;55(11):862-4. doi: 10.1136/jcp.55.11.862.,,,,,,,,,PMC1769801,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurite outgrowth from P9-14 RGC on laminin-1 was promoted by prior lens lesion and also during coculture with lesioned lenses. Neurite outgrowth from adult RGC following prior lens lesion, or in cocultures with lesioned lenses, required the presence of laminin-2. In media conditioned by lesioned lenses, the stimulatory effect on neurite outgrowth was still observed in the presence of K252a (trk receptor blocker) and mAb 228 (which blocks the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor).

The studies included cases diagnosed in 1993-1998 for all countries but Belarus, where the study period was extended until 2000. Four controls were selected in each country from the national cohort for each case, matched on age, gender and region of residence. Information on study subjects was obtained through face-to-face interview using a standardised questionnaire with questions on demographic factors, time, place and conditions of work as a liquidator and potential risk and confounding factors for the tumours of interest. Overall, 136 cases and 595 controls after receiving their consent were included in the studies. A method of analytical dose reconstruction has been developed, validated and applied to the estimation of doses and related uncertainties for all the subjects in the study.

The first case was a 27 years old man with CML. Molecular studies (RT-PCR) revealed the rearrangement in the major-BCR region and expression of chimeric BCR/ABL mRNA of b3a2 configuration. By classical cytogenetic studies (G-banding) karyotype 46,XY was found in short-term cultivated bone marrow cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. FISH studies revealed the BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and green BCR signals on both chromosomes 22 in all mitoses studied. Detection of the alleles of ABL1 intragenic STR locus by fluorescence PCR followed by fragmentation analysis in the patient and his parents provided no information about transmission of the ABL gene. Quantitative assessment of BCR/ABL transcript level by RT-PCR showed 60 and 70% BCR/ABL positivity in two peripheral blood samples at 6,5 and 10,5 months after diagnosis, respectively, which does not correspond to the expression from two identical BCR/ABL hybrid genes. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the origin of two BCR/ABL fusion signals present on both chromosomes 9 could not be resolved and remains speculative. The second case was a 53 years old male with diagnosis of chronic phase of CML, with first sign of acceleration one month after diagnosis and death because of sepsis in blastic phase within four months. The cytogenetic findings were identical to those in case No. 1., i.e. karyotype 46, XY by G-banding, two BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and RT-PCR molecular studies proved b3a2 breakpoints. It is generally accepted that prognosis of the patients with fused BCR/ABL gene located on chromosome 9 is poor. The presence of two fused genes could be anticipated as two Ph chromosomes in accelerated and blastic phases of the disease. However, in our study, quantitative findings of BCR/ABL transcripts did not corresponded to the expression of two BCR/ABL genes originating from duplication. If this assumption is correct then the expression of both fused genes BCR/ABL was in case No. 1 equally suppressed and total expression reached about the level of one BCR/ABL gene.","['Michalova, K', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Bkezinova, J', 'Moravcova, J', 'Oltova, A', 'Sobotka, J', 'Kuglik, P', 'Kozak, T', 'Sindelarova, L', 'Jankovska, M', 'Obomilova, A', 'Sieglova, Z', 'Polak, J', 'Nadvornikova, S', 'Haskovec, C']","['Michalova K', 'Zemanova Z', 'Bkezinova J', 'Moravcova J', 'Oltova A', 'Sobotka J', 'Kuglik P', 'Kozak T', 'Sindelarova L', 'Jankovska M', 'Obomilova A', 'Sieglova Z', 'Polak J', 'Nadvornikova S', 'Haskovec C']","['Center of Oncocytogenetics, General Faculty Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic. kyra@vfn.cz']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/10/29 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/10/29 04:00'],"['2002/10/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000003063 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Aug;43(8):1695-700. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000003063.,,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of REH cells with a P13 kinase/Akt inhibitor LY 294002 did not inhibit RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation showing that RAFTK is upstream of P13k/Akt. Further evidence for a link between RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt activation was the observation that the p85 subunit of P13 kinase associated with RAFTK following integrin ligation in REH cells.

Except for a rare case report, Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) have not been considered part of HNPCC. Recent murine models for HNPCC have shown an increased incidence of B- and T-cell lymphoma, as well as tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and other organ systems, involving defects in genes resulting in faulty mismatch repair (MMR) of DNA. These MMR genes include MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS1 and PMS2. We sought to analyze the occurrence of NHL and HD in families with clusters of colorectal cancers (CRC). Probands from 21 kindreds were classified as HNPCC (3), HNPCC-like (5), and HNPCC-variant (13); seen and followed by Clinical Genetics at Memorial Hospital the kindreds were assessed for the occurrence of NHL or HD. Of the 21 pedigrees, a total of 37 patients were identified who were diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, or HD. Fourteen of the 37 patients with a diagnosis of NHL or HD were further classified and showed varying histologies ranging from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (2), mycosis fungoides (1), follicular lymphoma (1), extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type (2), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (4), nodular sclerosis HD (3), and mixed cellularity HD (1). Microsatellite instability studies were performed on 6 cases but none showed evidence of replication error repair defects. Immunohistochemical stains performed on paraffin sections from these 6 representative cases showed differential protein expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 when compared to normal reactive tissues from the same patient but showed no significant differences when compared to controls of non-familial, sporadic lymphomas.

A-T patients exhibit a predisposition to the development of a wide range of lymphoid tumours, suggesting that the ATM protein normally plays an important role in the prevention of both T and B cell malignancies. The ATM protein is a 370 kDa protein kinase implicated in the integration of different cellular responses to particular forms of DNA damage. Several recent studies have reported the possibility that the ATM gene can act as a tumour suppressor gene in non A-T individuals. Frequent ATM inactivation was confirmed in three sporadic lymphoid tumours of mature phenotype: T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we provide a summary of the published ATM mutations in sporadic lymphoid tumours, including our own study on the role of ATM mutations in the pathogenesis of sporadic B-CLL. The published results suggest possible differences in the origin, the nature and distribution of ATM mutations between sporadic B-CLL, MCL and T-PLL. While ATM mutations in mature B cell tumours (B-CLL and MCL) represent a mixture of missense and truncating errors distributed across the whole of the ATM coding sequence, mutations in sporadic T-PLL appear to be predominantly missense, clustering in the region encoding the PI-3 kinase catalytic domain of the protein. The reason for this difference is unclear, but the difference itself supports the notion that the pathogenesis of B and T cell tumours on an ATM deficient background might be different. In addition, in both B-CLL and MCL ATM mutation carriers have been reported, raising the possibility that ATM mutation carriers may have an increased risk of developing these tumours. The existence as well as magnitude of the risk, however, remains to be established. Furthermore, our own studies indicate that the presence of ATM mutations in sporadic B-CLL causes a distinctive defect in response to DNA damaging agents, offering a possible explanation for the poor response of ATM mutant tumours to standard treatment. Therefore, one of the future challenges will be to devise strategies to bypass the existing defect in response to DNA damage and activate apoptosis in ATM mutant sporadic lymphoid tumours.","['Stankovic, T', 'Stewart, G S', 'Byrd, P', 'Fegan, C', 'Moss, P A H', 'Taylor, A M R']","['Stankovic T', 'Stewart GS', 'Byrd P', 'Fegan C', 'Moss PA', 'Taylor AM']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston. t.stankovic@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/10/29 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/10/29 04:00'],"['2002/10/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000002884 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Aug;43(8):1563-71. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000002884.,51,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, mutation of the FLT3 gene is so far the most frequent genetic alteration reported to be involved in AML.

The discovery of a connection between myeloid leukemia and chromosomal abnormalities in leukemic cells made human cytogenetics suddenly relevant to cancer research and diagnosis. Successful dietary treatment of phenylketonuria brought genetic disease into the domain of public health and provoked legislative programs with sweeping long-term consequences. Meanwhile, those promoting the importance of genetic disease to medical education began to elaborate the idea that disease was literally becoming more genetic, as a consequence of techno-historical change.

I emphasize the important roles of family members, religious isolates, legislators, pediatricians, and others who were not trained in genetic science, but who became advocates, at many levels, of genetic medicine.

However the links between genetic alterations and expression of the gene are not clearly determined. We established a quantitative RT-PCR assay based on TaqMan technology to quantify BCL-6 mRNA expression in different subtypes of lymphomas and to compare the level of expression in lymphomas characterized by the presence or absence of BCL-6 translocation. Total RNA was extracted from 105 nodes biopsies (35 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL); 26 follicle center lymphomas (FCL); 7 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL); 6 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL); 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); 5 T cell lymphomas (TCL); 7 classical Hodgkin diseases (HD); 6 nodal metastasis (NM); and 7 reactive hyperplasia (RH)). BCL-6 gene rearrangement was assessed by Southern blot analysis in 75% of 3q27(+) DLBCL (n = 20) cases and 67% of 3q27(+) cases (n = 10). The highest level of relative BCL-6 expression was observed in FCL (9.12 +/- 7.28) comparatively to the other lymphoma subtypes including DLBCL (2.53 +/- 1.82; P < 0.001), MCL (1.23 +/- 0.73), MZL (1.49 +/- 1.3), HD (1.60 +/- 1.00), TCL (1.75 +/- 1.64), but also RH (3.91 +/- 3.12) or NM (1.95 +/- 2.6). Among the 26 FCL cases, we observed a lower expression in grade 3 (n = 8) than in grade 1/2 (P < 0.001). Conversely, we failed to show any difference between 3q27(+) DLBCL and 3q27(-)DLBCL cases (P = 0.42). Paradoxically BCL-6 expression in 3q27(+) FCL (n = 10) was significantly lower than in 3q27(-) FCL cases (P = 0.035). Finally, this study showed that BCL-6 expression in lymphoma is largely independent of chromosome 3q27 rearrangement and is more related to the histological subtype.

We studied a distinct cohort of FLs with a 3q27/BCL-6 gene rearrangement, but lacking the t(14;18) translocation. In 13/15 cases, translocations involved the 3q27 and the 14q32 regions. All cases displayed a marked follicular growth pattern and, in some instances, a monocytoid component. Tumor cells were CD5(-) CD20(+) CD23(-) CD43(-) BCL-6(+), and in the main CD10 negative (n = 10, 71%) and BCL-2 negative (n = 11, 78%). When compared to 20 typical t(14;18)(+) FLs, the presence of large follicles (P = 0.01) and a CD10(-)/BCL-2(-) phenotype were more frequently observed (P = 0.001) in our cohort.

No significant difference was found in comparison to t(14;18)(+) FL regarding age, sex, performance status, bone marrow involvement or overall survival. However, in the 3q27(+) FL group, a stage III/IV disease and a bulky mass were less frequently observed. This study indicates that 3q27(+) FL without t(14;18) translocation have peculiar clinico-pathologic features and may correspond to a rare and distinct subtype of lymphoma originating from the germinal center.","['Jardin, F', 'Gaulard, P', 'Buchonnet, G', 'Contentin, N', 'Lepretre, S', 'Lenain, P', 'Stamatoullas, A', 'Picquenot, J M', 'Duval, C', 'Parmentier, F', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C']","['Jardin F', 'Gaulard P', 'Buchonnet G', 'Contentin N', 'Lepretre S', 'Lenain P', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Picquenot JM', 'Duval C', 'Parmentier F', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C']","['Department of Haematology and EMI 9906-IRFMP No. 23, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2001/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402707 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2309-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402707.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent rearrangement is t(4;11)(q21;q23), the role of whose product, the MLL-AF4 fusion transcript, has been extensively studied in leukemogenesis. In a cell line of infant leukemia with MLL rearrangement denoted KP-L-RY, panhandle PCR amplification of cDNA revealed the presence of a fusion transcript, MLL-AF5q31, indicating that AF5q31 is also a partner gene of MLL. In this fusion transcript the MLL exon 6 is fused in frame to the 5' side of the putative transactivation domain of AF5q31. The AF5q31 protein is a member of the AF4/LAF4/FMR2-related family of proteins, which have been suggested to play a role in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. The MLL-AF5q31 fusion transcript, although probably rare, appears to be associated with the pathogenesis of infant ALL like MLL-AF4. Co-expression of HoxA9 and Meis1 genes in the KP-L-RY cell line indicated possible functional similarity between MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF5q31.

We have examined effects of a fatty acid analogue, tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), on the functional phenotype of native, human AML cells. TTA inhibited AML blast proliferation in the presence of single cytokines (GM-CSF and SCF: P > 0.05, 35 patients with detectable proliferation) and a combination of cytokines (P < 0.005, n = 21). This antiproliferative effect was generally stronger than for the normal fatty acid palmitic acid (PA). Both TTA and PA increased the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) (P < 0.05, 27 patients with detectable cytokine release), but only PA increased interleukein 1beta (IL-1beta) release (P < 0.005, n = 34). AML blast populations varied significantly in their levels and activities of metabolites and enzymes characterizing oxidative status and fatty acid metabolism, and there was no significant correlation between the intrinsic oxidative status and the effects of PA and TTA on blast proliferation. Although TTA reduced the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated normal T cells derived from healthy individuals (P < 0.05, n = 8), no adverse effects were seen on peripheral blood cell counts (reticulocytes, platelets, total white blood cells, differential leukocyte counts) for healthy volunteers receiving TTA (oral administration of 1000 mg/day for 7 consecutive days). Our results suggest that TTA can inhibit AML blast proliferation through pathways that are unrelated to autocrine cytokine secretion and intrinsic oxidative status.","['Tronstad, K J', 'Bruserud, O', 'Berge, K', 'Berge, R K']","['Tronstad KJ', 'Bruserud O', 'Berge K', 'Berge RK']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2002/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402698 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2292-301. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402698.,,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '7ZU5I25S2O (1-(carboxymethylthio)tetradecane)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.3.3.- (acyl CoA oxidase 3)', 'EC 2.3.1.21 (Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SS (250 microg/ml, 6 days) induced 87% of NB4 cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), in comparison to the 90% induced by ATRA (1 microM, 6 days). SS treatment of NB4 cells resulted in an increase of CD11b expression and of a morphologically more mature population, coincident with growth arrest at S phase and increased cell death. The effect of SS on NB4 differentiation was irreversible and required continuous drug exposure. SS (400 microg/ml, 6 days) induced 60% and 55% of NBT-positive cells in HL-60 and U937 cell lines, which were augmented in the presence of GM-CSF (25 ng/ml) to levels (85% and 81%, respectively) comparable to those induced by ATRA. SS induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in the AML cell lines and inactivated SHP-1 PTPase in NB4 cells, consistent with SS functioning as a PTPase inhibitor in the leukemia cells.

Brusatol and bruceantin exerted significant cytotoxic effects with several leukemic cell lines, but not with K562 or normal lymphocytic cells. Cell lines that were less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of brusatol responded primarily through induction of terminal differentiation. The differentiated phenotype in cell lines derived from acute or chronic myeloid leukemias (HL-60, K562, Kasumi-1, NB4, U937, BV173) was characterized for producing superoxide and non-specific esterase, and some with up-regulation of CD13 (cluster of differentiation) and down-regulation of CD15. Chronic myeloid leukemic cell lines, K562 and BV173, and acute lymphoblastic cell lines, SUPB13 and RS4;11, were induced to differentiate along the erythrocytic pathway. Withdrawal studies showed that brusatol treatment for 48 h was sufficient to induce commitment towards terminal differentiation in HL-60, K562 and SUPB13. Reh cells did not undergo maturation. Analysis of c-MYC protein expression revealed that brusatol or bruceantin down-regulated expression to undetectable levels in cell lines that were most sensitive, based on cell death or terminal differentiation. Generally, c-myc RNA was reduced, but to a lower extent than c-MYC protein levels, indicating c-myc expression was regulated by quassinoids at the post-transcriptional level. Thus, regulation of c-myc expression may represent a critical event that leads to terminal differentiation. Since these responses are facilitated at clinically achievable concentrations, quassinoids may be of value for the management of hematological malignancies.","['Mata-Greenwood, E', 'Cuendet, M', 'Sher, D', 'Gustin, D', 'Stock, W', 'Pezzuto, J M']","['Mata-Greenwood E', 'Cuendet M', 'Sher D', 'Gustin D', 'Stock W', 'Pezzuto JM']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Brucea', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Preparations', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quassins/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2001/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402696 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2275-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402696.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Quassins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '14907-98-3 (brusatol)']",,,['P01 CA48112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated in a wide range of AML patients (n = 30), the nature and functional characteristics of the blast compartment that can be induced to acquire DC features in vitro. Our results demonstrate that leukemic DC generated in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and matured with CD40L, are composed of two major subsets: DC derived from CD14(+) leukemic cells and leukemic DC derived from in vivo expanded circulating blood myeloid DC (MDC). Leukemic DC of both subsets exhibited DC morphology, had a phenotype of mature DC, and could induce a potent proliferative response of naive CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, both subsets produced large amounts of IL-12p70 and leukemic CD14(+)-derived DC could induce a potent Th1 response.

Our data suggest that chromosomal instability and DNA repair defects may be involved in the pathophysiology of disease progression of MDS.","['Kuramoto, K', 'Ban, S', 'Oda, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'Kimura, A', 'Suzuki, G']","['Kuramoto K', 'Ban S', 'Oda K', 'Tanaka H', 'Kimura A', 'Suzuki G']","['Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', '*Endonucleases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphocytes/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*radiotherapy', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors', 'X-Rays']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2002/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402703 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2253-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402703.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA excision repair protein ERCC-5)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148998-67-8 (hay protein, Drosophila)', '156533-34-5 (XPC protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (ERCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 36 patients longitudinally by serial flow cytometry, and we determined the proportion of PNH red cells and granulocytes over a period of 1-6 years. We observed expansion of the PNH blood cell population(s) (at a rate of over 5% per year) in 12 out of 36 patients; in all other patients the PNH cell population either regressed or remained stable. The dynamics of the PNH cell population could not be predicted by clinical or hematologic parameters at presentation. These data indicate that in most cases the PNH cell expansion has already run its course by the time of diagnosis. In addition, since in most cases no further expansion takes place, we can infer that the tendency to overgrow normal cells is not an intrinsic property of the PNH clone.","['Araten, D J', 'Bessler, M', 'McKenzie, S', 'Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Childs, B H', 'Boulad, F', 'Karadimitris, A', 'Notaro, R', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Araten DJ', 'Bessler M', 'McKenzie S', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Childs BH', 'Boulad F', 'Karadimitris A', 'Notaro R', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology Division, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD59 Antigens/metabolism', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402694 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2243-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402694.,,,['0 (CD59 Antigens)'],,,['5R01 HL56778-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CT genes are expressed in some normal tissues, such as the testis and in some cases placenta, these immunologically protected sites lack MHC I expression and as such, do not present 'self' antigens to T cells. To date, CT genes have been shown to be expressed in a range of solid tumours, but rarely in haematological malignancies. We have extended previous studies to investigate the expression of a comprehensive range of CT genes (MAGE-A1, -A3, -A6, -A12, BAGE, GAGE, HAGE,LAGE-1, NY-ESO-1 and RAGE) for their expression in a cohort of acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia patient samples. CT expression was not detected in 20 normal bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell samples. In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) nine of the 26 (35%) samples analysed expressed one or more of the CT genes with six of the samples (23%) expressing HAGE. In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 24 of 42 (57%) presentation chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient samples expressed one or more CT antigen with 23 expressing HAGE. We have shown that HAGE is frequently expressed in CML, and to a lesser extent in AML patient samples. This is the first demonstration of HAGE gene expression in myeloid leukaemia patients and the frequent expression of HAGE at disease presentation opens up the possibility of early immunotherapeutic treatments.","['Adams, S P', 'Sahota, S S', 'Mijovic, A', 'Czepulkowski, B', 'Padua, R A', 'Mufti, G J', 'Guinn, B A']","['Adams SP', 'Sahota SS', 'Mijovic A', 'Czepulkowski B', 'Padua RA', 'Mufti GJ', 'Guinn BA']","[""Leukaemia Science Laboratories, Department of Haematological Medicine, Guy's, King's & St Thomas' School of Medicine, Rayne Institute, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Testis/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/26 04:00,2002/12/03 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2002/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402732 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Nov;16(11):2238-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402732.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX43 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared results obtained in 26 children given HSCT before January 1998 with those of 37 patients transplanted beyond that date. In all donor-recipient pairs, histocompatibility was determined by serology for HLA-A and -B antigens and by high-resolution DNA typing for DRB1 antigen. High-resolution molecular typing of HLA class I antigens was employed in 20 of the 37 children transplanted more recently. Probability of both acute and chronic GVHD was comparable in the two groups of patients. In multivariate analysis, children transplanted before January 1998, those with T-lineage ALL and those experiencing grade II-IV acute GVHD had a higher relative risk of TRM at 6 months after transplantation. Relapse rate was unfavorably affected by a time interval between diagnosis and relapse <30 months. The 2-year probability of EFS for children transplanted before and after 1 January 1998 was 27% (10-44) and 58% (42-75), respectively (P = 0.02), this difference remaining significant in multivariate analysis. EFS of unrelated donor HSCT in children with ALL in second CR has improved in the last few years, mainly due to a decreased TRM.

Despite significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses, resistance occurs, particularly in patients with advanced disease. We sought to determine the underlying mechanisms. Sixty-six patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis (n = 33), lymphoid blast crisis (n = 2), accelerated phase (n = 16), chronic phase (n = 13), and BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2) resistant to imatinib were investigated. Median duration of imatinib therapy was 148 days (range 6-882). Patients were evaluated for genomic amplification of BCR-ABL, overexpression of BCR-ABL transcripts, clonal karyotypic evolution, and mutations of the imatinib binding site in the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Results were as follows: (1) Median levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, were not significantly changed at the time of resistance but 7/55 patients showed a >10-fold increase in BCR-ABL levels; (2) genomic amplification of BCR-ABL was found in 2/32 patients evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization; (3) additional chromosomal aberrations were observed in 19/36 patients; (4) point mutations of the ABL tyrosine kinase domain resulting in reactivation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase were detected in 23/66 patients. In conclusion, although the heterogeneous development of imatinib resistance is challenging, the fact that BCR-ABL is active in many resistant patients suggests that the chimeric oncoprotein remains a good therapeutic target. However, patients with clonal evolution are more likely to have BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance. The observations warrant trials combining imatinib with other agents.","['Hochhaus, A', 'Kreil, S', 'Corbin, A S', 'La Rosee, P', 'Muller, M C', 'Lahaye, T', 'Hanfstein, B', 'Schoch, C', 'Cross, N C P', 'Berger, U', 'Gschaidmeier, H', 'Druker, B J', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Hochhaus A', 'Kreil S', 'Corbin AS', 'La Rosee P', 'Muller MC', 'Lahaye T', 'Hanfstein B', 'Schoch C', 'Cross NC', 'Berger U', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Druker BJ', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

Twenty patients in which both presentation and relapse material was available were analyzed sequentially. Thirty-three patients (37%) harbored the ITD, and seven (7.7%) the D835 mutation in blasts obtained at diagnosis. Presence of ITDs was strongly associated with high WBC count (P = 0.0001), M3 variant (P = 0.0004), and the short (BCR3) PML/RARalpha isoform (P = 0.003). There was no difference in response to induction in the two ITD+ve and ITD-ve groups, while a trend towards inferior outcome was observed for ITD+ve cases when analyzing disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse risk (RR). These differences, however, did not reach statistical significance. Sequential studies showed variable patterns in diagnostic and relapse material, ie ITD (-ve/-ve, +ve/+ve, +ve/-ve, -ve/+ve) and D835 (-ve/-ve, +ve/-ve, -ve/+ve).

This study was aimed at defining some of the molecular and phenotypic properties of this process. Biological models of tumor reversion were isolated from human leukemia and breast cancer cell lines by using the H-1 parvovirus as a selective agent. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between the parental malignant cells and their revertants or alternatively between these parental cells and their SIAH-1 transfectant counterparts. These SIAH-1 transfectants have a suppressed malignant phenotype and were used as a control for a viral-free system. Two hundred sixty-three genes were found to be either activated or inhibited during the reversion process, as confirmed by Northern blot analysis or quantitative PCR. Of these, 32% were differentially expressed in all systems, irrespective of whether parvovirus-selected, SIAH-1 overexpressing, or p53 mutant or wild-type cell lines were used, suggesting the existence of a universal mechanism underlying tumor reversion. Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (tpt1/TCTP) has the strongest differential expression, down-regulated in the reversion of U937- and SIAH-1-overexpressing cells. Inhibition of TCTP expression by anti-sense cDNA or small interfering RNA molecules results in suppression of the malignant phenotype and in cellular reorganization, similar to the effect of SIAH-1. Hence, tumor reversion can be defined at the molecular level, not just as the reversal of malignant transformation, but as a biological process in its own right involving a cellular reprogramming mechanism, overriding genetic changes in cancer, by triggering an alternative pathway leading to suppression of tumorigenicity.","['Tuynder, Marcel', 'Susini, Laurent', 'Prieur, Sylvie', 'Besse, Stephanie', 'Fiucci, Giusy', 'Amson, Robert', 'Telerman, Adam']","['Tuynder M', 'Susini L', 'Prieur S', 'Besse S', 'Fiucci G', 'Amson R', 'Telerman A']","['Molecular Engines Laboratories, 20 Rue Bouvier, 75011 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Basement Membrane/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'DNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2002/10/26 04:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/10/26 04:00'],"['2002/10/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.222470799 [doi]', '222470799 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):14976-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.222470799.

METHODOLOGY: Ninety patients with gastric lymphoma who underwent gastrectomy were included in this study. They were divided into T-cell and B-cell gastric lymphomas according to the immunohistochemical expression of surface T-cell or B-cell markers. Clinicopathological features and surgical outcome were compared between T-cell and B-cell gastric lymphomas. Correlation between T-cell gastric lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus, p53, MIB-1, and CD44 variant 6 on lymphoma cells was evaluated in 60 patients by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical examination. Anti-adult T-cell leukemia antigen was evaluated in 74 patients in the blood serum were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine of the 90 patients were classified as T-cell gastric lymphoma. Patients with T-cell gastric lymphoma had significantly more nodal involvement and poorer resectability than those with B-cell gastric lymphoma. Positivity of serum anti-adult T-cell leukemia antigen was significantly higher in T-cell lymphoma patients (100%) than in B-cell lymphoma patients (41%). However, there was no significant difference in Epstein-Barr virus positivity and expression of p53, MIB-1, CD44 variant 6 between T-cell and B-cell lymphomas. The five-year-survival rate in patients with T-cell gastric lymphomas was 0% and whereas that in B-cell gastric lymphoma was 45%, there was a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.01). Two patients with T-cell lymphoma who underwent emergency gastrectomy died in hospital during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcome of patients with T-cell lymphoma with anti-adult T-cell leukemia antigen tended to be very poor, despite curative resection.

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. For 27 years she had been treated for Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Because of progressive disease treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571, Glivec (R)) had been started 9 months before. She had achieved complete hematological remission within 8 weeks, but not a cytogenetic response. INVESTIGATIONS: Elevated WBC count (26.7/nl) with a differential displaying typical features of acceleration in bone marrow aspirate confirmed CML in accelerated phase. Sequencing of the ATP binding site of the BCR-ABL gene, which - at protein level - is the target for imatinib, revealed the clonal selection of cells harboring a point mutation leading to the exchange of amino acid 253 from tyrosine to histidine. This was considered to be the cause of resistance to imatinib. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Dose increase of imatinib up to 600 mg daily and administration of cytarabine did not overcome resistance. Imatinib therapy was discontinued; hematologic remission was induced by oral therapy with hydroxyurea and mercaptopurine. In the course of the following 6 months a gradual decrease of the resistant clone from 100 % down to lower than the detection limit of the method was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal mutations are often the cause of resistance to imatinib therapy. They can be detected by sequencing of the ATP binding site of BCR-ABL in specialized laboratories. This case shows that discontinuation of imatinib therapy can significantly reduce the mutated (resistant) clone and thereby restore sensitivity to imatinib.","['Muller, M C', 'Lahaye, T', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Muller MC', 'Lahaye T', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

Recently mutations of a growth factor receptor have been identified in about 30 % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. In-vitro and animal data show their involvement in leukemic transformation. Experiments analyzing the effects of these mutations on signal transduction and gene expression patterns of myeloid cells allow for the classification of this receptor as an oncogene. Furthermore, they help to define the receptor and its signaling intermediates as therapeutic targets. METHODS: In order to analyze the signaling properties of mutated FLT3 receptors, we isolated the receptor mRNA from two patients with AML. Wild-type and mutant Flt3 isoforms were expressed in 32D cells that were subsequently analyzed for proliferation, survival, activation of signaling intermediates and gene expression levels. Also, the effects of of Ras-, MAP-Kinase and PI3-Kinase inhibition were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of mutated Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) induced factor-independent proliferation and survival in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. Flt3-ITD activated Ras- and PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways, as well as STAT5 and STAT3. Activation of STAT proteins was followed by the induction of known STAT target genes like SOCS2, SOCS3 and CIS. Inhibition of Ras-dependent signal transduction by a dominant negative Ras construct inhibited some, but not all biological effects of Flt3-ITD. Similar results were obtained by chemical inhibition of the MAP kinases. In contrast, inhibition of PI3 kinase activity inhibited growth factor-independent growth and apoptosis resistance of 32D cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of Ras-dependent signaling pathways is not sufficient to abrogate the functional consequences of Flt3-mutations in myeloid cells. Therefore, therapeutic intervention by Ras-Inhibitors may not be sufficient to treat Flt3-driven disease.","['Muller-Tidow, C', 'Steur, C', 'Mizuki, M', 'Schwable, J', 'Brandts, C', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Steur C', 'Mizuki M', 'Schwable J', 'Brandts C', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Medizinische Klinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster.']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3', 'ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology']",2002/10/25 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/25 04:00'],"['2002/10/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-34942 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2002 Oct 18;127(42):2195-200. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-34942.,,Mutationen des Wachstumsfaktor-Rezeptors Flt3 bei Akuter Myeloischer Leukamie - Transformation myeloischer Zellen durch Ras-abhangige und Ras-unabhangige Mechanismen,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this immunological effect, attempts are currently being made to reduce the dosage of pre-treatment that is toxic to stem cell, such as TBI, thereby making transplantation available for a larger group of patients at high risk for transplantation. This study presents preliminary results of three current studies of this approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have an increased transplantation risk. They were conditioned with TBI that was reduced stepwise (n = 27). Patients with advanced and refractory myeloid leukemia were treated with chemotherapy and dose-reduced TBI (FLAMSA protocol; n = 54). In patients with multiple myeloma, autologous transplantation with high-dose chemotherapy preceded allogeneic transplantation possible after dose-reduced conditioning (Tandem protocol; n = 6). RESULTS: All three protocols of TBI gave results that were not worse than those of previous studies. Relapse ocurred not more frequently in patients with CML. In patients with high-risk AML the FLAMSA protocol gave better results. Autologous-allogeneic tandem transplantation was well tolerated and led to a good response in all patients. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic transplantation after dose-reduced conditioning opens up new possibilities with respect to widening indications for transplantation and improving results in hematological diseases with previously unsatisfactory treatment.","['Schmid, C', 'Weisser, M', 'Ledderose, G', 'Stotzer, O', 'Schleuning, M', 'Kolb, H-J']","['Schmid C', 'Weisser M', 'Ledderose G', 'Stotzer O', 'Schleuning M', 'Kolb HJ']","['Klinische Kooperationsgruppe ""Hamatopoetische Transplantation"", Jose-Carreras-Einheit fur hamatopoetische Transplantation, Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen.

Further on, phase-II-studies indicate that its addition to chemotherapy may improve the response rate substantially. However, so far, prospective randomized studies have not been available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 1998 the GLSG started a multicenter trial in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. A fludarabine-containing regimen (FCM) was chosen for salvage therapy, with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2)/d 1-3, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) d 1-3 and mitoxantrone 8 mg/m(2) d 1. A total of four courses, every 4 weeks were given. Patients were prospectively randomized for FCM alone or the immunochemotherapy with R-FCM (375 mg/m(2) one day before FCM) RESULTS: About 147 randomized patients 93 had follicular, 40 mantle cell and 14 lymphoplasmocytic/-cytoid lymphoma. Statistical analysis was performed by sequential testing and indicated for 94 fully evaluable patients a significant advantage for the R-FCM-arm, with an overall response rate of 83 % as compared to 58%, when treated with FCM alone (CR: 35 % vs. 13 %). Similar improvements of remission rate were detected in the different lymphoma subgroups, especially in MCL (OR: 65 % vs. 33 %). Both treatment options were associated with hematological toxicities of grade III and IV, but well tolerated; infectious complications were rare, with no difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This prospectively randomized trial demonstrates for the first time a significant improvement of the combined immunochemotherapy related to the remission rate in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma.","['Forstpointner, R', 'Hanel, A', 'Repp, R', 'Hermann, S', 'Metzner, B', 'Pott, C', 'Hartmann, F', 'Rothmann, F', 'Bock, H P', 'Wandt, H', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Forstpointner R', 'Hanel A', 'Repp R', 'Hermann S', 'Metzner B', 'Pott C', 'Hartmann F', 'Rothmann F', 'Bock HP', 'Wandt H', 'Unterhalt M', 'Hiddemann W']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Grosshadern, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Germany.

Astrocytes and microglia, the protagonists in these traumatic responses, are known to secrete a variety of paracrine signals. Oligodendrocytes are involved as well and constitute another possible source of cytokines. Here we show the expression of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF in OLN-93 cells, derived from rat oligodendrocyte primary cultures. While differential gene transcription after injury has been described for many cytokines, the regulation of these physiological responses is unknown in many instances. Recent experiments indicate that the transcriptional activator retinoic acid (RA) plays a role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Transcripts of the retinoic acid receptors and the retinoid X receptors were also detected in OLN-93 oligodendrocytes. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we have therefore investigated the effect of RA on the expression of neuropoietic cytokines in these cells. Treatment with 1 microM all- trans RA for 24 h increased the mRNA concentration of LIF by a factor of 3.1 ( P<0.01). In contrast, RA had no significant effect on the expression of CNTF.

The activity of acetyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetyltransferase, which is involved in the last step of PAF synthesis, is also reduced in L9 cells. p38 kinase inhibitors block acetyltransferase activity in normal -stimulated cells, suggesting that p38 kinase is involved in regulating acetyltransferase activity. Recombinant active p38 kinase activates acetyltransferase, whereas alkaline phosphatase reverses this, suggesting p38 kinase directly phosphorylates acetyltransferase. p38 kinase phosphorylation is blocked in L9 cells, indicating that high hydroperoxide levels are needed for the activation of p38 kinase. Thus, intracellular hydroperoxide levels participate in regulating p38 kinase phosphorylation, which in turn controls the activation of acetyltransferase and thus the synthesis of PAF. These observations suggest that PHGPx is an important component of the mechanisms regulating inflammation.","['Sakamoto, Hikaru', 'Tosaki, Takaki', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito']","['Sakamoto H', 'Tosaki T', 'Nakagawa Y']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A/*metabolism', 'Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Activating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/25 04:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2002/10/25 04:00'],"['2002/10/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204190200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)31351-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Dec 27;277(52):50431-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204190200.

METHODS: We generated T-cell lines from a patient who was undergoing an active GvL response following withdrawal of immunosuppression for cytogenetic relapse of CML. Cryopreserved pre-transplant leukemic cells were used as stimulators, to generate T-cell lines and oligoclonal lines from the lymphocytes. In total 38 sub-lines were generated from different bulk cultures. The lines were tested for their proliferative and cytotoxic capability to patient pre-transplant leukemic cells, PHA-transformed lymphoblasts, allogeneic CML cells, and autologous and allogeneic B-LCL. RESULTS: Four of the cloned lines tested recognized the patient's pre-transplant leukemic cells. Specifically, two were both cytotoxic and proliferative in response to patient leukemic cells and two were cytotoxic only. Six clonal lines recognized PHA blasts only and were proliferative; one was specific for PHA blasts and CML cells. The sub-lines were phenotyped for cell-surface markers and all were CD4(+) CD8(-) CD 16/56(-). The proliferative response of the leukemia-specific clonal lines could be blocked with anti-MHC Class II MAbs. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that CD4(+) cells play a crucial role in mediating the GvL effect in CML patients. Our observations can be used to delineate strategies for enhancing and investigating the GvL effect in CML.","['Dodi, I A', 'Van Rhee, F', 'Forde, H C', 'Roura-Mir, C', 'Jaraquemada, D', 'Goldman, J M', 'Madrigal, J A']","['Dodi IA', 'Van Rhee F', 'Forde HC', 'Roura-Mir C', 'Jaraquemada D', 'Goldman JM', 'Madrigal JA']","['The Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology']",2002/10/25 04:00,2003/04/10 05:00,['2002/10/25 04:00'],"['2002/10/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402760271145 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71071-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(4):353-63. doi: 10.1080/146532402760271145.,,,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate biologic assays that can detect these viruses, we compared an S(+)/L(-) assay and a marker rescue assay designed specifically for Eco-RCR detection. Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection was used as the positive control. For marker rescue, NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (3T3/Neo). Inoculation and passage of test material in 3T3/Neo cells for 3 weeks (amplification) and subsequent testing in the S(+)/L(-) assay or the marker rescue assay increased the level of sensitivity for virus detection greater than 10-fold compared with direct inoculation of D56 S(+)/L(-) cells. When serial dilutions of Mo-MuLV stock were evaluated, six of six cultures had detectable virus by the S(+)/L(-) and marker rescue assays at dilutions of 10(-5) and 10(-6). At the 10(-7) dilution, five of six assays had detectable virus in both assays. The ability to detect virus-infected cells was also evaluated in a modification that substituted cells for supernatant. Fifteen 3T3/Neo cultures inoculated with 10(6) 293 cells containing 100 or 10 Mo-MuLV/3T3 cells were all positive by marker rescue. For dilution with 1 virus-infected cell per 10(6) 293 cells, 10 of 15 cultures were positive. At the 0.1-cell dilution only 2 of 15 cultures were positive. If we hope to detect one infected cell in a test article, the probability of detecting virus if the assay is performed in triplicate is 96.3%. In summary, after 3 weeks of amplification the S(+)/L(-) and marker rescue assays can detect virus with similar sensitivities. We prefer the marker rescue assay because of the more reliable growth features of NIH 3T3 cells compared with the D56 cell line. For laboratories analyzing clinical materials, this report may prove useful in establishing detection assays for Eco-RCR.","['Reeves, Lilith', 'Duffy, Lisa', 'Koop, Sue', 'Fyffe, Joanne', 'Cornetta, Kenneth']","['Reeves L', 'Duffy L', 'Koop S', 'Fyffe J', 'Cornetta K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['3T3 Cells/virology', 'Animals', '*Biological Assay', 'Cell Line/virology', 'Defective Viruses/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Therapy/*standards', 'Genetic Vectors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase/*analysis/genetics', 'Kidney', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Safety', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",2002/10/25 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/10/25 04:00'],"['2002/10/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303402760293619 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 Sep 20;13(14):1783-90. doi: 10.1089/104303402760293619.,,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even at low MOIs (< or =1) the cPPT vector still shows a better transduction efficiency than the no-cPPT vector. Moreover, transduction does not require dendritic cell differentiation. In contrast, infection of nonactivated T lymphocytes showed that both vectors, tested at high MOIs, can transduce a small, although measurable, percentage of cells (up to 10%), which may correspond to G(1a) ""activated"" cells as detected by simultaneous staining of DNA and RNA, in our cultures in the presence of medium alone. Furthermore, we show that the sole addition of interleukin 2 or interleukin 15 represents a full proliferative signal under our conditions and permits high transduction efficiency (up to 30% with the cPPT vector and 15% with the no-cPPT vector). Still higher transduction of T lymphocytes can be achieved after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin 2 (up to 78% with the cPPT vector vs. 42% with the no-cPPT vector).

The epithelioid morphology in PL is still underrecognized and may closely simulate other epithelial neoplasms, mainly adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC). No electron microscopic (EM) studies of the epithelioid variant of PL have been previously described, nor have there been studies of its immunoreactivity with A103 or alpha-inhibin. The purpose of this study is to analyze the histological, immunohistochemical, and EM features of epithelioid PL in an attempt to better explore the distinction from their epithelial mimickers, such as ACC. A panel of 5 antibodies was studied, including A103, alpha-inhibin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), AE1/AE3, and Cam 5.2. Out of 22 cases of PLs, 6 cases characterized by the presence of both epithelioid phenotype and pleomorphic lipoblasts were identified from the EM archives. There were 4 females and 2 males, with a mean age of 58 (range, 39-78). Two lesions arose in the thigh and 1 each in the abdominal wall, chest wall, anterior mediastinum, and retroperitoneum, with tumor size ranging from 7 to 17 cm (mean, 13 cm). Histologically, 2 PLs were pure epithelioid, whereas the other 4 had a mixed epithelioid and MFH-like appearance. Immunohistochemically, A103 (4/6), SMA (4/6), and AE1/AE3 (1/6) revealed a various degree of positive reactions. No immunolabeling for alpha-inhibin or Cam5.2 was detected in any case. By EM, the epithelioid areas revealed round or polyhedral cells with lipid droplets of various sizes and number, intimately apposed cell surfaces, occasional junction-like structures (4/6), and micropinocytotic vesicles (4/6). Interestingly, the ribosome-lamellar complexes, once thought to be characteristic of hairy cell leukemia but rarely seen in solid tumors, were noted in one pure epithelioid PL. When compared to the MFH-like area, rough endoplasmic reticula (RER) were less well developed, but mitochondria were more prominent in the epithelioid components. Neither mitochondria with tubulovesicular cristae nor prominent smooth endoplasmic reticula indicative of ACC were seen. Well-formed external lamina was not present. Other features to support a higher level of epithelial differentiation, such as lumen formation, microvilli, and tonofilaments, were not found. In conclusion, focal A103 reactivity in epithelioid undifferentiated tumors should be interpreted with caution before rendering the diagnosis of a primary or metastatic ACC, especially when examining biopsy specimens. The possibility of an epithelioid variant of PL must be excluded; alpha-inhibin can serve as a useful adjunct in this regard. In addition to variable intracytoplasmic fat droplets, the distinctive ultrastructural features of epithelioid variant of PL include numerous mitochondria, pinocytotic vesicles, junction-like structures, and, rarely, ribosome-lamellar complex. Despite some overlapping features, electron microscopy remains a useful tool to distinguish between epithelioid PL and ACC.","['Huang, Hsuan-Ying', 'Antonescu, Cristina R']","['Huang HY', 'Antonescu CR']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Epithelioid Cells/*chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibins/analysis', 'Lipids', 'Liposarcoma/*chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Neoplasms/*chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Organelles/ultrastructure']",2002/10/25 04:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2002/10/25 04:00'],"['2002/10/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01913120290104575 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2002 Sep-Oct;26(5):299-308. doi: 10.1080/01913120290104575.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (inhibin-alpha subunit)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this system transformation can be induced at will by the addition of dexamethasone, which induces the expression of H- ras by activating the mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) promoter. This facilitates a reliable comparison of the susceptibility of normal and transformed cells to EGCG. It has been shown that EGCG inhibited the growth of transformed but not of the normal fibroblasts. In an attempt to elucidate the mode of the preferential inhibitory activity of EGCG, its effect on growth promoting factors has been examined. The level of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17), which is a signal for cellular proliferation, was reduced by EGCG in the transformed but not in the normal cells. EGCG also showed strong inhibition of tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities, without affecting the kinases in the normal cells. Similarly, EGCG also preferentially decreased the levels of the oncogenes Ras and Jun in transformed cell. EGCG preferentially induced apoptosis in the transformed fibroblasts.

DESIGN: Observational study during a 10-yr period. SETTING: A 22-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: A total of 84 consecutive patients with nonterminal hematologic malignancies with medical complications requiring intensive care. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic factors, acute physiology and organ dysfunction scores, microbiology, therapeutic support, and hematologic factors data on admission and during the intensive care unit stay were collected, together with mortality follow-up. Based on specific-disease prognostic factors and related published survival curves, the prognosis of hematologic malignancies was assessed and defined as good, intermediate, or poor according to a 3-yr survival probability of >50%, 20-50%, or <20%, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: Prognosis of hematologic malignancies does not predict intensive care unit or hospital mortality and almost reaches significance for 6-mo mortality (53%, 71%, and 84% rate for patients with good, intermediate, and poor prognosis, respectively, p =.058), but it determines long-term survival (p =.008). Intensive care unit, hospital, and 6-mo overall mortality rates were 38%, 61%, and 75%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, intensive care unit mortality was best predicted on admission by respiratory failure and fungal infection, whereas hospital mortality was predicted by the number of organ failures, the bone marrow transplant status, and the presence of fungal infection. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II had no prognostic value, whereas the difference of the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score between at the time of admission and at day 5 allowed quick prediction of hospital mortality. Diseases with the poorest 6-mo prognosis were acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CONCLUSION The severity of the underlying hematologic malignancies does not influence intensive care unit or hospital mortality. Short-term prognosis is exclusively predicted by acute organ dysfunctions and by a pathogen's aggressiveness. Therefore, reluctance to admit patients with nonterminal hematologic malignancies to the intensive care unit based only on the prognosis of their underlying hematologic malignancy does not seem justified.","['Massion, Paul B', 'Dive, Alain M', 'Doyen, Chantal', 'Bulpa, Pierre', 'Jamart, Jacques', 'Bosly, Andre', 'Installe, Etienne']","['Massion PB', 'Dive AM', 'Doyen C', 'Bulpa P', 'Jamart J', 'Bosly A', 'Installe E']","['Department of Critial Care Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires de Mont-Godinne, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Yvoir, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['APACHE', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/10/24 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-200210000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2002 Oct;30(10):2260-70. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200210000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization study was performed on bone marrow biopsies derived from 11 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia after sex-mismatched BMT to quantify the CD34 cell population and their expression. After proper identification by a lineage-specific monoclonal antibody, X chromosome- and Y chromosome-specific probes were used for sex typing and for labeling of the locus commercially available detection systems were applied. RESULTS: After successful engraftment, 241 progenitor cells were identified at days 9 to 586 of the posttransplant period. Overall incidence of MCh was 24% with a tendency to decline after day 100 to 15%. The gene was detectable in only 10% of these precursors and decreased to less than 4% after more than 6 months. Approximately 0.5 to 5.5 years after BMT in six patients, a manifest leukemic relapse occurred, which was accompanied by a conversion of donor-to-host-type progenitors. This phenomenon involved up to 94% of the 303 evaluable CD34 cells and also included a retrieval of the translocation gene in approximately 50% of this population. CONCLUSION: The lineage-restricted MCh of progenitors after BMT is in keeping with the assumption that leukemic (bcr/abl ) precursors represent only a fraction of the total host-derived (chimeric) CD34 cells. These residual clonally transformed progenitors survive myeloablative treatment and thus may be the source for a later relapse.","['Thiele, Juergen', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Kvasnicka, Hans Michael', 'Varus, Eva', 'Kleppe, Stephanie', 'Beelen, Dietrich Wilhelm', 'Schaefer, Ullrich Wilhelm']","['Thiele J', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Varus E', 'Kleppe S', 'Beelen DW', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*surgery', 'Male', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/10/24 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200210150-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2002 Oct 15;74(7):982-6. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200210150-00015.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prostatic smooth muscle cells contract under adrenergic control. The response of a cell to stretch may have a role in the pathogenesis of BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monolayer cultures of human prostatic stromal and epithelial cell lines were exposed to cyclic stretch for 48 hours. RESULTS: Cyclic stretch conferred resistance to etoposide induced apoptosis. Underlying this apoptotic resistance was increased expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins. As measured by thymidine incorporation, the rate of proliferation also increased in benign epithelial cells under cyclic stretch conditions. Furthermore, an increase in the production of platelet-derived growth factor by stromal cells and transforming growth factor-beta by epithelial cells occurred under such conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes in proliferation and apoptosis may contribute to the understanding of BPH, ultimately leading to therapeutic and preventive applications.","['Hegarty, Paul K', 'Watson, R William G', 'Coffey, Ronan N T', 'Webber, Mukta M', 'Fitzpatrick, John M']","['Hegarty PK', 'Watson RW', 'Coffey RN', 'Webber MM', 'Fitzpatrick JM']","['Department of Surgery, Mater Misericordiae Hospital and University College Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Physical Stimulation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Prostate/*physiopathology', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/*physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/10/24 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ju.0000031566.22200.4e [doi]', 'S0022-5347(05)64373-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2002 Nov;168(5):2291-5. doi: 10.1097/01.ju.0000031566.22200.4e.,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was set in Aleppo Governorate, Syria with a population of 2.7 million. Information about newly diagnosed cases of cancer was obtained from pathology labs ( =12) and general hospitals ( =5) in the city between August 1998 and August 1999. Pre-piloted charts were distributed to the labs and one of the labs staff was instructed on how to fill them. Information about benign tumours was also gathered. Between August 1998 and August 1999, 1802 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in Aleppo Governorate (970 in men and 832 in women), giving an overall crude incidence rate of 72.8 per 100 000 person-years for this population. The mean age of patients diagnosed with malignant tumours was 51.2 +/- 21.3 and 47.6 +/- 18.5 for males and females, respectively. In males, age-adjusted incidence rates were higher for bladder, leukaemia and lung cancers, in that order. In females age-adjusted incidence rates were higher for breast, uterus (+ cervix) and leukaemia. In conclusion, the presented data represent the first attempt to use standardized methodology to arrive at approximate estimates of the rate of occurrence of different cancers in Aleppo, Syria, and to characterize their patterns and distribution within the population. It calls for the importance of establishing a reliable cancer registry in Syria.","['Mzayek, F', 'Asfar, T', 'Rastam, S', 'Maziak, W']","['Mzayek F', 'Asfar T', 'Rastam S', 'Maziak W']","['Department of Experimental Audiology, University of Muenster, Domagkstrasse 3, 48129 Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Rural Health', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Syria/epidemiology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00008469-200210000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2002 Oct;11(5):503-7. doi: 10.1097/00008469-200210000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor lymphocytes appears to be caused mainly by alloreactive T cells that are capable of recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens on the malignant cell population from the patient. The tissue distribution of minor histocompatibility antigens probably determines the clinical result of T-cell responses against these antigens. Whereas T cells recognizing broadly expressed antigens cause not only graft-versus-leukemia but also graft-versus-host disease, T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens specifically expressed on hematopoietic cells may mainly eliminate hematopoietic cells from the recipient, including the malignant cells, without affecting donor hematopoiesis or normal nonhematopoietic tissues.

All patients received similar induction therapy. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 8.3 years. Nonprioritized cytogenetics distinguished t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) as conferring a significantly better prognosis than normal karyotype. Prognostic impact of many abnormalities could not be determined independently because of their association with complex karyotype. Neither complex karyotype nor secondary aberrations affected outcome of patients with t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), or t(9;11). Among other patients, those with complex karyotypes had significantly worse outcomes than cytogenetically normal patients. Based on outcome for specific cytogenetic abnormalities and karyotype complexity, patients were divided into 3 risk groups: favorable (CR 88%, CIR 54%, OS 55%), intermediate (CR 67%, CIR 67%, OS 24%), and adverse (CR 32%, CIR 92%, OS 5%). Multivariate analyses confirmed the major contribution of cytogenetics to the probability of attaining CR, CIR, and OS. For the adverse-risk group, the probability of achieving CR was 4.0 and 11.9 times lower, the probability of relapse 3.0 and 4.4 times higher, and the risk of death 2.1 and 4.3 times higher than those for the intermediate and favorable groups, respectively. We conclude that although the prognostic impact of many recurring abnormalities has not been ascertained independently of complex karyotype, cytogenetics is among the most useful factors predicting attainment of CR, CIR, and long-term survival in adult AML.","['Byrd, John C', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Dodge, Richard K', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Patil, Shivanand R', 'Rao, Kathleen W', 'Watson, Michael S', 'Koduru, Prasad R K', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Feldman, Eric J', 'Davey, Frederick R', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Byrd JC', 'Mrozek K', 'Dodge RK', 'Carroll AJ', 'Edwards CG', 'Arthur DC', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Patil SR', 'Rao KW', 'Watson MS', 'Koduru PR', 'Moore JO', 'Stone RM', 'Mayer RJ', 'Feldman EJ', 'Davey FR', 'Schiffer CA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1240, USA. byrd-3@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trisomy']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0772 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53635-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4325-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0772.

The only curative treatment today consists of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, which is only partially successful in the absence of an HLA genoidentical donor, thus justifying research to find an alternative therapeutic approach. To this end, RAG-2-deficient mice were used to test whether retrovirally mediated ex vivo gene transfer into HSCs could provide long-term correction of the immunologic deficiency. Murine RAG-2-/-Sca-1(+) selected bone marrow cells were transduced with a modified Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-based MND (myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer, negative control region deleted, dl587rev primer-binding site substituted) retroviral vector containing the RAG-2 cDNA and transplanted into RAG-2-/- sublethally irradiated mice (3Gy). Two months later, T- and B-cell development was achieved in all mice. Diverse repertoire of T cells as well as proliferative capacity in the presence of mitogens, allogeneic cells, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were shown. B-cell function as shown by serum Ig levels and antibody response to a challenge by KLH also developed. Lymphoid subsets and function were shown to be stable over a one-year period without evidence of any detectable toxicity. Noteworthy, a selective advantage for transduced lymphoid cells was evidenced by comparative provirus quantification in lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Altogether, this study demonstrates the efficiency of ex vivo RAG-2 gene transfer in HSCs to correct the immune deficiency of RAG-2-/- mice, constituting a significant step toward clinical application.","['Yates, Frank', 'Malassis-Seris, Michele', 'Stockholm, Daniel', 'Bouneaud, Cecile', 'Larousserie, Frederique', 'Noguiez-Hellin, Patricia', 'Danos, Olivier', 'Kohn, Donald B', 'Fischer, Alain', 'de Villartay, Jean-Pierre', 'Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina']","['Yates F', 'Malassis-Seris M', 'Stockholm D', 'Bouneaud C', 'Larousserie F', 'Noguiez-Hellin P', 'Danos O', 'Kohn DB', 'Fischer A', 'de Villartay JP', 'Cavazzana-Calvo M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U429, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0782 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51348-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 1;100(12):3942-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0782.

Among the different subgroups of MDS, a significant increase (ie, at least 0.003%) of PNH-type cells was detected in 21 of 119 patients with refractory anemia (RA); this frequency (17.6%) of RA patients with increased PNH-type cells (PNH(+) patients) was much lower than what we previously reported (52.0%) for AA patients. PNH(+) RA patients had distinct clinical features compared with RA patients without increased PNH-type cells (PNH(-) patients), such as less pronounced morphologic abnormality of blood cells, more severe thrombocytopenia, lower rates of karyotypic abnormality (4.8% vs 32.8%) and of progression to acute leukemia (0% vs 6.2%), higher probability of response to cyclosporine therapy (77.8% vs 0%), and higher incidence of HLA-DR15 (90.5% vs 18.5%). These data indicate that the presence of a minor population of PNH-type cells suggests a benign type of bone marrow failure, probably caused by an immunologic mechanism.

Radioimmunoassay (RIA) demonstrates that about 500 000 C3b(i) molecules deposit per cell, and fluorescence microscopy reveals that C3b(i) colocalizes with bound RTX. Use of mAb 3E7, specific for C3b(i) bound to substrates, enhances C3b(i) deposition; > 1 million C3b(i) deposit when cells are incubated with NHS, RTX and mAb 3E7. Treatment of Raji cells in NHS plus RTX leads to robust cell killing (95%) after 24 to 48 hours, and mAb 3E7 significantly enhances RTX-mediated killing of Raji and DB cells. A cynomolgus monkey model based on intravenous infusion of RTX followed by mAb 3E7 demonstrated that RTX rapidly binds to B cells and promotes complement activation and C3b(i) deposition; fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed the same pattern of colocalization of C3b(i) on cell-bound RTX in vivo as observed in vitro. Preliminary in vitro studies with blood samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia lead to similar findings. These experiments suggest that complement plays a key role in the mechanism of action of RTX; moreover, the in vivo molecular form of RTX (and possibly other antitumor mAbs) in the circulation or in tissues may include C3b(i) molecules covalently bound to the therapeutic mAb, thus allowing it to interact with cells containing both Fc and complement receptors.","['Kennedy, Adam D', 'Solga, Michael D', 'Schuman, Theodore A', 'Chi, Amos W', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Sutherland, William M', 'Foley, Patricia L', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Kennedy AD', 'Solga MD', 'Schuman TA', 'Chi AW', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Sutherland WM', 'Foley PL', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Center for Comparative Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908-0733, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Complement Activation/*drug effects', 'Complement C3b/*immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0876 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57040-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1071-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0876.

Hence, the identification of new apoptosis-inducing agents, specifically targeting malignant cells while sparing their normal counterparts, is of crucial interest. We show here that monoglycerides, a family of lipids consisting of a single fatty acid attached to a glycerol backbone, induce cell death in several human leukemic cell lines. Importantly, treatment of primary leukemic cells, obtained from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, resulted in rapid apoptosis. In striking contrast, resting or activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals were resistant to the same treatment.

Median follow-up time from transplantation was 60 months. Transplantation of bone marrow cells was performed in 318 children, whereas in 60 patients peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) were used. In multivariate analysis, we investigated the variables influencing probability of hematopoietic recovery, transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and leukemia-free survival (LFS). We found that use of PBPCs as stem cell sources and use of BCNU (N,N-bis[2-chloroethyl]-N-nitrosourea), amsacrine, VP-16, and cytosine arabinoside (BAVC) as a preparative regimen were associated with faster neutrophil recovery. Infusion of PBPCs, young age of patients, use of BAVCs, and absence of marrow purging predicted an accelerated platelet reconstitution. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of TRM, relapse, and LFS were 3% +/- 1%, 39% +/- 3% and 60% +/- 3%, respectively. Relapse probability was increased in children given the BAVC regimen, and it was decreased after in vitro purging of hematopoietic progenitors and in children with a French-American-British classification of M3 and a time interval of 170 days or more between CR and HSCT.

In human leukocyte antigen A*0201(+) (HLA-A*0201(+)) individuals, response after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) was shown to be associated with the emergence of CML-specific cytotoxic T cells that recognize PR-1, a myeloblastin (MBN)-derived nonapeptide. In contrast, imatinib potently induces remissions from CML by specific inhibition of the ABL tyrosine kinase. Here, we explored molecular regulations associated with CML responses under different treatment forms using cDNA-array. Expression of MBN was found to be down-regulated in remission under imatinib therapy (0 of 7 MBN(+) patients). In contrast, MBN transcription was readily detectable in the peripheral blood in 8 of 8 tested IFN-alpha patients in complete remission (P =.0002). IFN-alpha-dependent MBN transcription was confirmed in vitro by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with IFN-alpha and by IFN-alpha-mediated activation of the MBN promoter in reporter gene assays. Finally, with the use of HLA-A*0201-restricted, MBN-specific tetrameric complexes, it was demonstrated that all of 4 IFN-alpha-treated patients (100%), but only 2 of 11 imatinib patients (19%), in complete hematological or cytogenetic remission developed MBN-specific cytotoxic T cells (P =.011). Together, the induction of MBN expression by IFN-alpha, but not imatinib, may contribute to the specific ability of IFN-alpha to induce an MBN-specific T-cell response in CML patients. This also implies that the character of remissions achieved with either drug may not be equivalent and therefore a therapy modality combining IFN-alpha and imatinib may be most effective.","['Burchert, Andreas', 'Wolfl, Stefan', 'Schmidt, Manuel', 'Brendel, Cornelia', 'Denecke, Barbara', 'Cai, Dali', 'Odyvanova, Larissa', 'Lahaye, Tanja', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Berg, Thomas', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Wittig, Burghardt', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Burchert A', 'Wolfl S', 'Schmidt M', 'Brendel C', 'Denecke B', 'Cai D', 'Odyvanova L', 'Lahaye T', 'Muller MC', 'Berg T', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Wittig B', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Neubauer A']","['Klinikum der Philipps Universitat Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Myeloblastin', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0659 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53591-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 1;101(1):259-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0659.

Previous studies have demonstrated that, in addition to IgG Fc receptors, the human myeloid IgA receptor (Fc(alpha)RI, CD89) also effectively triggered tumor cell killing. Therefore, we used the variable light and heavy chain sequences from another murine anti-HLA class II hybridoma, F3.3, to generate a panel of chimeric human/mouse antibodies, including human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Antibody production was accomplished by stable transfection of baby hamster kidney cells, and binding activity and specificity were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. All constructs demonstrated similar binding to HLA class II. Functional studies revealed that chimeric IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2 triggered similar levels of tumor cell lysis. Analyses of effector populations, however, demonstrated that killing by chimeric IgG1 constructs was triggered mainly by human mononuclear cells and complement, while IgA1 and IgA2 mediated effective lysis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Importantly, IgG1 and both IgA isotypes were equally effective at killing freshly isolated human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.

Because GSLs are often cryptic antigens on cell membranes, little is known regarding GSL expression in early myelopoiesis. To study the latter, myeloblasts were collected from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) who required therapeutic leukocytopheresis for hyperleukocytosis. The neutral GSLs were isolated and identified by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), HPTLC immunostaining, gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Like mature peripheral blood neutrophils, myeloblasts expressed glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and the neolacto-family GSLs, lactotriaosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide. Unlike neutrophils and chronic myeloid leukemia, most ANLL samples also expressed the globo-series GSLs, globotriaosylceramide and globotetraosylceramide. Globo GSL expression was strongly associated with a myeloblastic (ANLL M0-M2) and monoblastic phenotype (M5). A weak association was also noted with expression of either lymphoid (P <.10) or early hematopoietic markers (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT], CD34; P <.10). Globo-positive ANLL samples bound both shiga toxin and parvovirus B19 on HPTLC immunostaining. Based on these findings, we propose that neolacto and globo GSLs are expressed during early myeloid differentiation. Globotriaosylceramide expression on myeloblasts, and possibly myeloid stem cells, may have important implications for the use of shiga toxin as an ex vivo purging agent in autologous stem cell transplantation. Expression of globotetraosylceramide, the parvovirus B19 receptor, on myeloblasts may also explain the association between B19 infection, aplastic anemia, and chronic neutropenia of childhood.","['Cooling, Laura L W', 'Zhang, De Sheng', 'Naides, Stanley J', 'Koerner, Theodore A W']","['Cooling LL', 'Zhang DS', 'Naides SJ', 'Koerner TA']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA. lcooling@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Ceramides/analysis', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical/methods', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Globosides/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*analysis/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis', 'Shiga Toxin/metabolism']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0718 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44534-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):711-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0718.

In this report, we identify a novel class of experimental agents selectively potentiating the cytodifferentiating activity of ATRA and synthetic retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists in APL and other myeloid leukemia cell lines. These agents have a bis-indolic structure (BISINDS), and ST1346 is the prototypical compound of the series. Gene-profiling experiments and determination of the level of expression of myeloid-associated markers indicate that ST1346 stimulates many aspects of the granulocytic maturation process set in motion by ATRA. Stimulation of the cytodifferentiating activity of ATRA by ST1346 enhances the efficacy of the retinoid in vivo, as demonstrated in the APL model of the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse receiving transplants of NB4 cells. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATRA-potentiating action of ST1346 and congeners have not been completely clarified, bis-indols are not ligands and do not exert any direct effect on the ATRA-dependent transactivation of nuclear receptors. However, ST1346 inhibits the down-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent CREB transcriptional complexes and enhances the level of expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 (STAT1), 2 putative molecular determinants of the differentiation process activated by ATRA in APL cells. More importantly, ST1346 relieves the down-regulation of Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) afforded by ATRA. In addition, a specific JNK inhibitor blocks the enhancing effect of ST1346 on ATRA-induced maturation of NB4 cells. This demonstrates an important role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase in the molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacologic activity of the bis-indol.","['Pisano, Claudio', 'Kollar, Peter', 'Gianni, Maurizio', 'Kalac, Yesim', 'Giordano, Vincenzo', 'Ferrara, Fabiana Fosca', 'Tancredi, Richard', 'Devoto, Antonio', 'Rinaldi, Alessandra', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Penco, Sergio', 'Marzi, Mauro', 'Moretti, Giampiero', 'Vesci, Loredana', 'Tinti, Ornella', 'Carminati, Paolo', 'Terao, Mineko', 'Garattini, Enrico']","['Pisano C', 'Kollar P', 'Gianni M', 'Kalac Y', 'Giordano V', 'Ferrara FF', 'Tancredi R', 'Devoto A', 'Rinaldi A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Penco S', 'Marzi M', 'Moretti G', 'Vesci L', 'Tinti O', 'Carminati P', 'Terao M', 'Garattini E']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0720 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54136-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3719-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0720.

In this paper we have used genetic engineering and sulfur chemistry to prepare 2 types of human gamma1 CD3 mAb dimer, with the aim of improving complement lysis activity. The IgG molecules forming the dimers were linked together at their C-termini by stable bismaleimide thioether bridges. The first dimer was composed of 2 bivalent mAb molecules. This dimer proved incapable of lysing human T-cell blasts with human, rabbit, or guinea pig complement. The second dimer consisted of 2 molecules of a monovalent derivative (possessing a single Fab domain) of the bivalent mAb. This dimer was highly lytic with human complement, with a lytic titer 64-fold greater than that of the nondimerized monovalent mAb. The maximum level of lysis of human T-cell blasts achieved with this monovalent mAb dimer was equal to that obtained with the therapeutic antilymphocyte mAb alemtuzumab, but its lytic titer was 4-fold greater. The monovalent mAb dimer was also found to be lytic in the presence of rabbit and guinea pig complement. Dimerization of monovalent antibodies may provide a general strategy for improving the cytolytic activity of other mAbs that are normally unable to induce lysis with complement.

Polyclonal, oligoclonal, and monoclonal TCR-CDR3 patterns were seen within such overexpressed native CD4 and CD8 TCR-BV families. In nonoverexpressed TCR-BV families, monoclonal and oligoclonal populations were noted only within the CD8 subset. After in vitro stimulation of T cells with autologous leukemic B cells, analyses of the CDR3 length patterns showed that in expanded TCR-BV populations, polyclonal patterns frequently shifted toward a monoclonal/oligoclonal profile, whereas largely monoclonal patterns in native overexpressed TCR-BV subsets remained monoclonal. Seventy-five percent of CD8 expansions found in freshly obtained CD8 T cells further expanded on in vitro stimulation with autologous leukemic B cells. This suggests a memory status of such cells. In contrast, the unusually high frequency of CD4 T-cell expansions found in freshly isolated peripheral blood cells did not correlate positively to in vitro stimulation as only 1 of 9 expansions continued to expand.

Its product is normally required for the maintenance of Hox gene expression during embryogenesis and hematopoiesis through molecular mechanisms that remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) is proteolytically processed into 2 fragments (MLL(N) and MLL(C)) that display opposite transcriptional properties and form an intramolecular MLL complex in vivo. Proteolytic cleavage occurs at 2 amino acids (D2666 and D2718) within a consensus processing sequence (QXD/GZDD, where X is a hydrophobic amino acid and Z is an alanine or a valine) that is conserved in TRX, the Drosophila homolog of MLL, and in the MLL-related protein MLL2, suggesting that processing is important for MLL function. Processed MLL(N) and MLL(C) associate with each other via N-terminal (1253-2254 amino acids) and C-terminal (3602-3742 amino acids) intramolecular interaction domains. MLL processing occurs rapidly within a few hours after translation and is followed by the phosphorylation of MLL(C). MLL(N) displays transcriptional repression activity, whereas MLL(C) has strong transcriptional activation properties. Leukemia-associated MLL fusion proteins lack the MLL processing sites, do not undergo cleavage, and are unable to interact with MLL(C). These observations suggest that posttranslational modifications of MLL may participate in regulating its activity as a transcription factor and that this aspect of its function is perturbed by leukemogenic fusions.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Ayton, Paul M', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Ohki, Misao']","['Yokoyama A', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Ayton PM', 'Cleary ML', 'Ohki M']","['Chromatin Function in Leukemogenesis Project and Cancer Genomics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/*genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1015 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54135-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3710-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1015.

We therefore sought to evaluate in kinetic terms interactions between T cells and allogeneic leukemic cells. T cells primed against the model B6(dom1) minor histocompatibility antigen were adoptively transferred in irradiated B10 (B6(dom1)-positive) and congenic B10.H7(b) (B6(dom1)-negative) recipients, some of which were also injected with EL4 leukemia/lymphoma cells (B6(dom1)-positive). A key finding was that the tissue distribution of the target epitope dramatically influenced the outcome of adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Widespread expression of B6(dom1) in B10 recipients induced apoptosis and dysfunction of antigen-specific T cells. Furthermore, in leukemic B10 and B10.H7(b) hosts, a massive accumulation of effector/memory B6(dom1)-specific T cells was detected in the bone marrow, the main site of EL4 cell growth. The accumulation of effector/memory cells in recipient bone marrow was EL4 dependent, and its kinetics was different from that observed in recipient spleen. We conclude that strategies must be devised to prevent apoptosis of adoptively transferred T cells confronted with a high antigen load and that local monitoring of the immune response at the site of tumor growth may be mandatory for a meaningful assessment of the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.","['Meunier, Marie-Christine', 'Roy-Proulx, Guillaume', 'Labrecque, Nathalie', 'Perreault, Claude']","['Meunier MC', 'Roy-Proulx G', 'Labrecque N', 'Perreault C']","['Guy-Bernier Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, PQ, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Epitopes/*metabolism', 'Glycosyltransferases/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods/standards', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1032 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44541-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):766-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1032.

HLA-identical BMT was performed for patients with acute (n = 39) or chronic leukemia (n = 68). Genotyping was performed in 107 D/R DNA pairs for gene polymorphisms of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and TNF-beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-6, and IL-10), adhesion molecules (CD31 and CD54), Fcgammareceptors (FcgammaRIIa, IIIa, IIIb), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). First infection (overall) and first episodes of bacterial, viral, or invasive fungal infection were studied retrospectively for 180 days after BMT. Univariate and multivariate analyses, using death as a competing event, were performed to study risk factors. In multivariate analysis, first overall infections were increased in patients with the FcgammaRIIa R-131 genotype (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.92; P =.04), and severe bacterial infections were increased when the MPO donor genotype was AG or AA (HR = 2.16; P =.03). Viral and invasive fungal infections were not influenced by any genetic factor studied. Interestingly, we also found that (1) time to neutrophil recovery was shorter when donors were FcgammaRIIIb HNA-1a/HNA-1b (HR = 1.77; P =.002); (2) donor IL-1Ra (absence of IL-1RN*2) increased the risk for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (II-IV) (HR = 2.17; P =.017); and (3) recipient IL-10 (GG) and IL-1Ra genotypes increased the risk for chronic GVHD (P =.03 and P =.03, respectively). Finally, 180-day transplantation-related mortality rates were increased when donors were FcgammaRIIIb HNA-1a/HNA-1a or HNA-1b/HNA-1b (HR = 2.57; P =.05) and donor MPO genotype was AA (HR = 5.14; P =.004).

Here we analyzed the transformation specificity of 2 acute chicken leukemia retroviruses, the Myb-Ets- encoding E26 virus and the ErbA/ErbB-encoding avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV). While cells transformed by E26 are multipotent (designated ""MEP"" cells), those transformed by AEV resemble erythroblasts. Using antibodies to separate subpopulations of precirculation yolk sac cells, both viruses were found to induce the proliferation of primitive erythroid progenitors within 2 days of infection. However, while AEV induced a block in differentiation of the cells, E26 induced a gradual shift in their phenotype and the acquisition of the potential for multilineage differentiation. These results suggest that the Myb-Ets oncoprotein of the E26 leukemia virus converts primitive erythroid cells into proliferating definitive-type multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.","['McNagny, Kelly M', 'Graf, Thomas']","['McNagny KM', 'Graf T']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/physiology', 'Blastoderm/pathology/virology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/methods', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chick Embryo', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology/*virology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/virology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/pathology/*virology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/*virology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1050 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57044-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1103-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1050.

The cytokine Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) also has been shown to generate BM DCs. We sought to determine if DCs generated by using Flt3L then matured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could lead to DCs with in vivo anti-acute myelogenous leukemia (anti-AML) activity. LPS and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are effective agents for maturing DCs; however, they have potential in vivo toxicities. Cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpGs) are considered relatively nontoxic, potent activators of DC function and maturation in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether CpGs would be comparable to TNF-alpha or LPS for the maturation of GM-CSF/IL-4-generated DCs. DCs cultured with GM-CSF/IL-4 and matured with TNF-alpha, LPS, or CpG produced a greater allogeneic T-cell response compared with Flt3L/LPS-generated DCs. All 4 distinct DC types were pulsed with AML-lysate and administered before tumor challenge produced an increase in the total number of splenic anti-AML-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors and led to significantly (P < or =.0001) improved survival compared with nonvaccinated controls. GM-CSF/IL-4/LPS was superior to Flt3L/LPS for generating anti-AML effects in vivo. Whereas TNF-alpha was comparable to LPS in conferring on GM-CSF/IL-4 DCs anti-AML effects in vivo, CpGs were superior to LPS. These data have important clinical implications and are the first to show that Flt3L-generated DCs can provide antitumor protection and that nontoxic agents such as CpGs and Flt3L may be useful in the clinical development of DC vaccines.","['Weigel, Brenda J', 'Nath, Narender', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Chen, Wei', 'Krieg, Arthur M', 'Brasel, Kenneth', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Weigel BJ', 'Nath N', 'Taylor PA', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Chen W', 'Krieg AM', 'Brasel K', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Minneapolis 55455, USA. weige007@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/toxicity']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1063 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51376-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 1;100(12):4169-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1063.

To determine the potential role of CHK2 alterations in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms we have examined the gene status, protein, and mRNA expression in a series of tumors and nonneoplastic lymphoid samples. A heterozygous Ile157Thr substitution, also present in the germ line of the patient, was detected in a blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). CHK2 protein and mRNA expression levels were similar in all types of lymphomas and reactive samples, and these levels were independent of the proliferative activity of the tumors. However, 5 tumors, one typical MCL, 2 blastoid MCLs, and 2 large cell lymphomas, showed marked loss of protein expression, including 2 samples with complete absence of CHK2 protein. These 2 lymphomas showed the highest number of chromosomal imbalances detected by comparative genomic hybridization in the whole series of cases. However, no mutations, deletions, or hypermethylation of the promoter region were identified in any of these tumors. mRNA levels were similar in cases with low and normal protein expression, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of the protein in these tumors. CHK2 gene and protein alterations were not related to p53 and ATM gene status. In conclusion, CHK2 alterations are uncommon in malignant lymphomas but occur in a subset of aggressive tumors independently of p53 or ATM alterations.

This consensus is supported by the results of several series, including a randomized German trial. Here we report 11-year results of the latter trial. With stringent response criteria and 4 months as the time to evaluate responses, this analysis confirms the superiority of the cyclosporine regimen regarding the response rate in all patients treated (70% vs 41%, with or without cyclosporine; P =.015) and in patients with severe aplastic anemia (65% vs 31%; P =.011). Patients responded more rapidly after treatment with cyclosporine (median, 60 vs 82 days; P =.019). Most patients treated with cyclosporine needed only one course of immunosuppression, whereas many patients treated without cyclosporine required repeated immunosuppressive treatment. Because of the efficacy of salvage treatment, overall survival was not different between the 2 treatment groups. However, failure-free survival favored the cyclosporine regimen (39% vs 24%; P =.04). The relapse rate, projected at 38% after 11.3 years, was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Remissions were cyclosporine dependent in 26% of the patients responding to a regimen that included cyclosporine. Clonal or malignant diseases developed in 25% of the patients. These data demonstrate that antithymocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporin A are an effective regimen for the treatment of aplastic anemia.

Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.","['Harada, Hironori', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Tanaka, Hideo', 'Kimura, Akiro', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Tanaka H', 'Kimura A', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology and the Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan. herf1@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1010 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44528-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):673-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1010.

FLT3/ITDs result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain and transform growth factor-dependent cell lines. FLT3 activation leads to antiapoptotic and proliferative signals, but little is known about the impact of FLT3/ITDs on differentiation. This study was designed to investigate the effect of FLT3/ITD expression on the differentiation of the 32Dcl3 (32D) myeloblastic cell line to neutrophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Expression of FLT3/ITD completely blocked morphologic differentiation and induction of myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) in response to G-CSF. Wild-type FLT3 and vector-transfected 32D cells were able to differentiate, although the maturation of FLT3-transfected cells was delayed by FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation. CEP-701, a potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, overcame the morphologic block in differentiation caused by FLT3/ITD expression and allowed G-CSF induction of myeloid maturation markers. These findings suggest that blocking differentiation may be one of the mechanisms by which FLT3/ITDs contribute to leukemogenesis. CEP-701 and other FLT3 inhibitors may be useful for overcoming the block to differentiation (as well as the block to apoptosis) in the leukemic cells of patients with AML.","['Zheng, Rui', 'Friedman, Alan D', 'Small, Donald']","['Zheng R', 'Friedman AD', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Furans', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0936 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51374-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 1;100(12):4154-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0936.

We designed a prospective cohort study to define the incidence and risk factors for late CMV infection in patients who undergo HSCT. CMV-seropositive patients were studied prospectively for CMV infection (quantitative pp65 antigenemia, quantitative CMV-DNA, blood culture), T-cell immunity (CMV-specific CD4(+) T-helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, CD4 and CD8 T-cell count, absolute lymphocyte count), and other transplantation-related factors. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess the risk for late CMV infection and disease and to assess overall survival. Late CMV disease developed in 26 of 146 (17.8%) patients a median of 169 days after transplantation (range, 96-784 days); the mortality rate was 46%. Thirty-eight percent of patients surviving late disease had a second episode a median of 79 days after the first episode. At 3 months after transplantation, preceding detection of CMV pp65 antigenemia, CD4 T-cell counts lower than 50 cells/mm(3), postengraftment absolute lymphopenia levels lower than 100 lymphocytes/mm(3), undetectable CMV-specific T-cell responses, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were associated with late CMV disease or death. After 3 months, continued detection of pp65 antigenemia or CMV DNA in plasma or peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphopenia (fewer than 300 lymphocytes/mm(3)) were strong predictors of late CMV disease and death. In conclusion, CMV viral load, lymphopenia, and CMV-specific T-cell immunodeficiency are predictors of late CMV disease and death after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Prevention strategies should be targeted at patients in whom CMV reactivated during the first 3 months and those with poor CMV-specific immunity or low CD4 counts.","['Boeckh, Michael', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Riddell, Stanley R', 'Bowden, Raleigh A', 'Huang, Meei-Li', 'Myerson, David', 'Stevens-Ayers, Terry', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Cunningham, Terri', 'Corey, Lawrence']","['Boeckh M', 'Leisenring W', 'Riddell SR', 'Bowden RA', 'Huang ML', 'Myerson D', 'Stevens-Ayers T', 'Flowers ME', 'Cunningham T', 'Corey L']","['Program in Infectious Diseases Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. mboeckh@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/growth & development/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Activation']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0993 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44491-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):407-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0993.

This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of Bcr-Abl and of the small molecule Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced neutrophilic differentiation. We show that differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells into mature granulocytes is accompanied by the increased expression of the antigens macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) and Gr-1, of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), of myeloid transcription factors (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha [C/EBPalpha], C/EBPepsilon, and PU.1), and of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). In 32Dcl3 cells transfected with the bcr-abl gene (32D(Bcr-Abl)), G-CSF did not trigger either granulocytic differentiation or the up-regulation of C/EBPalpha, C/EBPepsilon, and the G-CSFR. This could be correlated to a defect in c-Myc down-regulation. In contrast, the up-regulation of PU.1 and p27(Kip1) by G-CSF was not affected by Bcr-Abl. Importantly, incubation of 32D(Bcr-Ablwt) cells with the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate prior to G-CSF stimulation completely neutralized the effects of Bcr-Abl on granulocytic differentiation and on C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon expression. Taken together, the results suggest that the Bcr-Abl kinase induces a reversible block of the granulocytic differentiation program in myeloid cells by disturbing regulation of hematopoietic transcription factors such as C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon.","['Schuster, Christine', 'Forster, Karin', 'Dierks, Henning', 'Elsasser, Annika', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Simon, Nicola', 'Danhauser-Riedl, Susanne', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Warmuth, Markus']","['Schuster C', 'Forster K', 'Dierks H', 'Elsasser A', 'Behre G', 'Simon N', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Hallek M', 'Warmuth M']","['Klinische Kooperationsgruppe Gentherapie, GSF-National Research Institute for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0043 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44526-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):655-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0043.

Following clinical improvement of one previously untreated CLL patient with sildenafil therapy, we evaluated the in vitro induction of apoptosis in CLL cells by 4 PDE5/6 inhibitors, including sildenafil, vardenafil, zaprinast, and methoxyquinazoline (MQZ). After 24 hours of culture, the various PDE inhibitors differed in their ability to induce apoptosis, with zaprinast displaying no killing effect. Normal B cells isolated from control donors were totally resistant to PDE-induced apoptosis. Vardenafil was 3 and 30 times more potent an inducer of apoptosis than sildenafil and MQZ, respectively. Both vardenafil and sildenafil failed to elevate adenosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, largely excluding an inhibitory effect on cAMP-PDE3, -PDE4, and -PDE7. Vardenafil- or sildenafil-treated B-CLL cells displayed up to 30% intracellular active caspase 3. Drug-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, prevented by interleukin-4 (IL-4), and significantly reduced by stromal-derived factor1-alpha (SDF-1alpha). We conclude that vardenafil and sildenafil induce caspase-dependent apoptosis of B-CLL cells in vitro and thus might be considered in the treatment of CLL patients.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), VEGF is expressed at high levels in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. We show here that the CML-associated oncogene BCR/ABL induces VEGF gene expression in growth factor-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Whereas starved cells were found to contain only baseline levels of VEGF mRNA, Ba/F3 cells induced to express BCR/ABL exhibited substantial amounts of VEGF mRNA. BCR/ABL also induced VEGF promoter activity and increased VEGF protein levels in Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, BCR/ABL was found to promote the expression of functionally active hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a major transcriptional regulator of VEGF gene expression. BCR/ABL-induced VEGF gene expression was counteracted by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 and rapamycin, an antagonist of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), but not by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Similarly, BCR/ABL-dependent HIF-1alpha expression was inhibited by the addition of LY294002 and rapamycin.

However, the signal transduction pathways responsible for oncogenesis by the Asp814Val mutant (KIT(Val814)) are not fully understood. To examine the oncogenic signal transduction of KIT(Val814), we converted 20 tyrosine (Tyr) residues to phenylalanine (Phe) in the cytoplasmic domain of KIT(Val814) or deleted the C-terminal region containing 2 other tyrosine residues (Del). Among various KIT(Val814)- derived mutants, KIT(Val814-Tyr719Phe) and KIT(Val814-Del) severely impaired receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (p85 (PI3-K)). Moreover, KIT(Val814-Tyr719Phe) and KIT(Val814-Del) failed to induce ligand-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells, indicating that Tyr719, the binding site for p85(PI3-K), and the C-terminal region are indispensable for factor-independent growth by KIT(Val814). Although the C-terminal region was also required for ligand-dependent growth by wild-type KIT (KIT(WT)), the Tyr719Phe substitution had negligible effects on ligand-dependent growth by KIT(WT). Furthermore, dominant-negative PI3-K significantly inhibited ligand-independent growth by KIT(Val814). These results demonstrate that Tyr719 is crucial for constitutive activation of KIT(Val814), but not for the ligand-induced activation of KIT(WT), and that the downstream signaling of PI3-K plays an important role in ligand-independent growth and tumorigenicity by KIT(Val814), thereby suggesting that KIT(Val814) is a unique activating mutation that leads to a distinguishable function from the effects of KIT(WT).","['Hashimoto, Koji', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Tsujimura, Tohru', 'Kim, Dae-Ki', 'Ogihara, Hideki', 'Ikeda, Hirokazu', 'Ueda, Shuji', 'Mizuki, Masao', 'Sugahara, Hiroyuki', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Kitamura, Yukihiko', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Hashimoto K', 'Matsumura I', 'Tsujimura T', 'Kim DK', 'Ogihara H', 'Ikeda H', 'Ueda S', 'Mizuki M', 'Sugahara H', 'Shibayama H', 'Kitamura Y', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/genetics']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0177 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57043-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1094-102. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0177.

However, increasing evidence exists that B-CLL is more than a disease consisting of slowly accumulating resting B cells: a proliferating pool of cells has been described in lymph nodes and bone marrow and might feed the accumulating pool in the blood. Rapamycin has been reported to inhibit cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types, including human B cells, and has shown activity against a broad range of human tumor cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the ability of rapamycin to block cell cycle progression in proliferating B-CLL cells. We have recently demonstrated that stimulation with CpG-oligonucleotides and interleukin-2 provides a valuable model for studying cell cycle regulation in malignant B cells. In our present study, we demonstrated that rapamycin induced cell cycle arrest in proliferating B-CLL cells and inhibited phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (p70(s6k)). In contrast to previous reports on nonmalignant B cells, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 was not changed in rapamycin-treated leukemic cells. Treatment with rapamycin prevented retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation in B-CLL cells without affecting the expression of cyclin D2, but cyclin D3 was no longer detectable in rapamycin-treated B-CLL cells. In addition, rapamycin treatment inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by preventing up-regulation of cyclin E and cyclin A. Interestingly, survivin, which is expressed in the proliferation centers of B-CLL patients in vivo, is not up-regulated in rapamycin-treated cells. Therefore, rapamycin interferes with the expression of many critical molecules for cell cycle regulation in cycling B-CLL cells. We conclude from our study that rapamycin might be an attractive substance for therapy for B-CLL patients by inducing a G(1) arrest in proliferating tumor cells.","['Decker, Thomas', 'Hipp, Susanne', 'Ringshausen, Ingo', 'Bogner, Christian', 'Oelsner, Madlene', 'Schneller, Folker', 'Peschel, Christian']","['Decker T', 'Hipp S', 'Ringshausen I', 'Bogner C', 'Oelsner M', 'Schneller F', 'Peschel C']","['3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany. t.decker@lrz.tu-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclin A/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin E/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Survivin']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0189 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53594-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 1;101(1):278-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0189.

This is mainly because MDS blasts are a minor population in clinical samples, making analysis difficult. Thus, for this blast phenotype study, we prepared blast-rich specimens (using a new density centrifugation reagent for harvesting blasts) from blood and marrow samples of 95 patients with various MDS subtypes and 21 patients with acute leukemia transformed from MDS (AL-MDS). Flow cytometry revealed that a high proportion of the enriched blast cells (EBCs) from almost all patients showed an immunophenotype of committed myeloid precursors (CD34(+)CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)CD13(+)CD33(+)), regardless of the disease subtype. The cytochemical reaction for myeloperoxidase was negative in 58% of the cases. Thus, the EBC phenotype is more immature in MDS than in de novo acute myeloid leukemia. MDS EBCs often coexpressed stem cell antigens and late-stage myeloid antigens asynchronously, but rarely expressed T- and B-lymphoid cell-specific antigens. Markers for myeloid cell maturation (CD10 and CD15) were more prevalent on EBCs from low-risk MDS (refractory anemia [RA] and RA with ringed sideroblasts), whereas markers for myeloid cell immaturity (CD7 and CD117) were more prevalent on EBCs from high-risk MDS (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, RA with excess blasts [RAEB], and RAEB in transformation) and AL-MDS. A shift to a more immature phenotype of EBCs, accompanying disease progression, was also documented by sequential phenotyping of the same patients. Further, CD7 positivity of EBCs was an independent variable for a poor prognosis in MDS. These data represent new, valuable information regarding MDS.","['Ogata, Kiyoyuki', 'Nakamura, Kyoko', 'Yokose, Norio', 'Tamura, Hideto', 'Tachibana, Mikiko', 'Taniguchi, Osamu', 'Iwakiri, Rika', 'Hayashi, Tatsuyuki', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Murai, Yoshiro', 'Tohyama, Kaoru', 'Tomoyasu, Shigeru', 'Nonaka, Yasunobu', 'Mori, Mayumi', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Yoshida, Yataro']","['Ogata K', 'Nakamura K', 'Yokose N', 'Tamura H', 'Tachibana M', 'Taniguchi O', 'Iwakiri R', 'Hayashi T', 'Sakamaki H', 'Murai Y', 'Tohyama K', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Nonaka Y', 'Mori M', 'Dan K', 'Yoshida Y']","['Division of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Kyoto, Japan. ogata@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient/methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metrizamide', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0222 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51340-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 1;100(12):3887-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0222.

The aims of this study were to determine the level of ABCG2 mRNA expression necessary to produce drug resistance and to define the ABCG2 levels in normal bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), cord blood (CB), and adult AML blast cell populations. First, using transduced clonal cell lines expressing varying levels of ABCG2, we found that ABCG2 expression conferred resistance to mitoxantrone and topotecan, but not to idarubicin. Next, we developed a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for measuring ABCG2 mRNA expression levels in clinical samples. Normal BM and PB contained low levels of ABCG2 mRNA, while higher levels were measured in CB mononuclear cells, CD34(+), and Ac133(+) populations, consistent with the known stem cell enrichment in these populations. Next, we studied the ABCG2 mRNA levels in 40 specimens from newly diagnosed adult AML patients. Only 7% of these samples contained ABCG2 mRNA levels within the range of our drug-resistant clone, although another 78% were higher than normal blood and bone marrow. Flow cytometry revealed very small subpopulations of ABCG2-expressing cells in the cases we examined. Our data suggest that high levels of ABCG2 mRNA expression in adult AML blast specimens are relatively uncommon and that ABCG2 expression may be limited to a small cell subpopulation in some cases.","['Abbott, Brian L', 'Colapietro, Anne-Marie', 'Barnes, Yuxiao', 'Marini, Frank', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Sorrentino, Brian P']","['Abbott BL', 'Colapietro AM', 'Barnes Y', 'Marini F', 'Andreeff M', 'Sorrentino BP']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Topotecan/pharmacology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0271 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53669-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4594-601. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0271.

Mutations at the IBP may lead to resistance of the Abl kinase against imatinib mesylate. To examine the mechanisms of imatinib mesylate binding and resistance in more detail, we created several point mutations at amino acid positions 315 and 380 of Abl, blocking the access to the IBP and rendering Bcr-Abl imatinib mesylate-resistant. Moreover, introduction of a mutation destabilizing the inactive conformation of Abl (Asp276Ser/Glu279Ser) also led to imatinib mesylate resistance, suggesting that the inhibitor required inactivation of the kinase prior to binding. These Bcr-Abl mutants were then used to evaluate the binding mode and specificity of 2 compounds, PP1 and CGP76030, originally characterized as Src kinase inhibitors. Both compounds inhibited Bcr-Abl in a concentration-dependent manner by overlapping binding modes. However, in contrast to imatinib mesylate, PP1 and CGP76030 blocked cell growth and survival in cells expressing various inhibitor-resistant Abl mutants. Studies on the potential signaling mechanisms demonstrated that in cells expressing inhibitor-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants, PP1 and CGP76030 inhibited the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases and Akt but not signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) and JUN kinase (Jnk).

Recently, hematopoietic cell-specific CDM protein DOCK2 has been shown to be indispensable for lymphocyte migration. However, the regulatory mechanism for DOCK2 is still unknown because DOCK2 lacks a c-Crk-II binding consensus motif. In this study, we demonstrated that DOCK2 bound to CrkL, which is present exclusively in hematopoietic cells both in vivo and in vitro, and we also found that 2 separate regions of DOCK2 contributed to its binding to Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of CrkL. Colocalization of DOCK2 with Crk-like (CrkL) and F-actin was shown by immunocytochemical analysis with the use of Jurkat cells. We also found that CrkL-induced activation of small guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 was significantly inhibited by the DOCK2-dCS mutant in 293T cells. Furthermore, the association of DOCK2 and Vav, the guanine-nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF) for Rac1, was demonstrated in Jurkat cells.

In an effort to understand the regulation of EPO-induced proliferation and JNK activation, we have examined the role of potential autocrine factors in the proliferation of the murine erythroleukemia cell line HCD57. We report here that treatment of these cells with EPO induced the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). EPO-dependent proliferation was reduced by the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TNF-alpha, and exogenously added TNF-alpha induced proliferation of HCD57 cells. EPO also could induce TNF-alpha expression in BAF3 and DA3 myeloid cells ectopically expressing EPOR. Addition of TNF-alpha activated JNK in HCD57 cells, and the activity of JNK was partially inhibited by addition of a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody. Primary human and murine erythroid progenitors expressed TNF-alpha in either an EPO-dependent or constitutive manner. However, TNF-alpha had an inhibitory effect on both immature primary human and murine cells, suggestive that the proliferative effects of TNF-alpha may be limited to erythroleukemic cells. This study suggests a novel role for autocrine TNF-alpha expression in the proliferation of erythroleukemia cells that is distinct from the effect of TNF-alpha in normal erythropoiesis.","['Jacobs-Helber, Sarah M', 'Roh, Kwan-Ho', 'Bailey, Daniel', 'Dessypris, Emmanuel N', 'Ryan, John J', 'Chen, Jingchun', 'Wickrema, Amittha', 'Barber, Dwayne L', 'Dent, Paul', 'Sawyer, Stephen T']","['Jacobs-Helber SM', 'Roh KH', 'Bailey D', 'Dessypris EN', 'Ryan JJ', 'Chen J', 'Wickrema A', 'Barber DL', 'Dent P', 'Sawyer ST']","['Departments of Pharmacology/Toxicology, Radiation Oncology and Physiology, Medical College of Virginia Campus, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/drug effects/*physiology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0084 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44509-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):524-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0084.

Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) remains a disease with poor prognosis. Similar to solid tumors, it probably requires angiogenesis to ensure adequate supplies of nutrients. We studied rats with transplanted AML to test if a neutralizing anti-leptin receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) (anti-OB-R) could inhibit leukemogenesis. At 4 weeks after transplantation, the bone marrow contained about 80% leukemic cells as assayed with a specific mAb and flow cytometry. Microscopic examination of bone marrow sections stained with an anti-von Willebrand mAb revealed a marked increase in microvessel density in the leukemic rats compared with controls. Treatment with anti-OB-R for 3 weeks more than halved the content of bone marrow leukemic cells with a concomitant, substantial decrease in angiogenesis. A parallel experiment using an irrelevant anticasein mAb showed no effect on either leukemic cell growth or angiogenesis. We could not detect surface expression of the leptin receptor on the leukemic cells, but on mononuclear cells from healthy rats. The anti-OB-R did not affect in vitro proliferation of leukemic cells whereas proliferation of the mononuclear cells was markedly impaired. The anti-OB-R had no effect on either leukemic cell growth or angiogenesis in leukemic fa/fa rats with a mutated leptin receptor. We conclude that leptin stimulates leukemic cell growth in vivo by promoting angiogenesis.

We explored NQO1 C609T as a genetic risk factor in 39 pediatric de novo and 18 pediatric treatment-related leukemias with MLL translocations in the United States. Children with de novo B-lineage ALL without MLL translocations and a calculation of the expected genotype distribution in an ethnically matched population of disease-free subjects served as the comparison groups.

Because of favorable phase 2 data using mitoxantrone and etoposide, we conducted a phase 3 study (SWOG-9333) in which patients over 55 years of age with previously untreated AML were randomized to receive mitoxantrone (10 mg/m(2) per day x 5) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2) per day x 5) [ME], or cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) per day x 7) and daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2) per day x 3) [AD] as induction therapy.

The viral oncoprotein Tax, through the activation of nuclear factorkappaB (NF-kappaB), CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (CREB), and activated protein-1 (AP-1) pathways, is a transcriptional regulator of critical genes for T-cell homeostasis. In ATL cells, activated AP-1 complexes induce the production of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). TGF-beta1 is an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Here we show that, in contrast to normal peripheral T cells, ATL cells are resistant to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition. The retroviral transduction of the Tax protein in peripheral T cells resulted in the loss of TGF-beta1 sensitivity. Transient transfection of Tax in HepG2 cells specifically inhibited Smad/TGF-beta1 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of Tax transfection, increasing amounts of Smad3 restored TGF-beta1 signaling. Tax mutants unable to activate NF-kappaB or CREB pathways were also able to repress Smad3 transcriptional activity. Next we have demonstrated that Tax inhibits TGF-beta1 signaling by reducing the Smad3 DNA binding activity. However, Tax did not decrease the expression and the nuclear translocation of Smad3 nor did it interact physically with Smad3. Rather, Tax induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and c-Jun phosphorylation, leading to the formation of Smad3/c-Jun complexes.

We have attempted to improve the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect by generating allorestricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed against human CD45. Such CTLs should recognize patient hematopoietic cells including leukemia, enhancing donor cell engraftment and improving the GVL effect, but they should not recognize host nonhematopoietic tissues or donor cells from the graft. Using the T2 binding assay, 4 CD45-derived peptides were found to bind HLA-A2 molecules. These peptides were used to generate cytotoxic T-cell lines from HLA-A2(-) donors by sequential stimulation with peptide-pulsed HLA-A2(+) stimulators, and the lines obtained were screened for peptide-specific cytotoxicity. Using one of these peptides (P1218), it was possible to generate peptide-specific, allorestricted CTLs in 3 of 7 responders. P1218-specific CTL lines show potent cytotoxicity against hematopoietic cell lines coexpressing HLA-A2 and CD45 but not CD45 loss variants. Studies with stable transfectants of 293 cells demonstrated recognition by P1218-specific CTLs of endogenously expressed CD45. Likewise P1218-specific CTLs recognized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-A2(+) patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and leukemic blasts in HLA-A2(+) patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but they were unable to lyse HLA-A2(+) fibroblasts or HLA-A2(-) normal PBMCs. Coculture of CD34(+) PBMCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) with P1218-specific CTL significantly inhibited colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) formation in HLA-A2(+) healthy controls and CML patients but resulted in no significant inhibition in HLA-A2(-) healthy controls. These studies demonstrate that P1218-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have potent activity against leukemic progenitors and suggest that adoptive immunotherapy with allorestricted CTLs directed against CD45 epitopes may be useful in restoring the GVL effect after HLA-A2-mismatched haploidentical transplantation. Further, because P1218-specific CTLs also recognize healthy HLA-A2(+) progenitors, such CTLs could also contribute to host myeloablation and enhance donor cell engraftment.","['Amrolia, Persis J', 'Reid, Steven D', 'Gao, Liquan', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Goldman, John M', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Amrolia PJ', 'Reid SD', 'Gao L', 'Schultheis B', 'Dotti G', 'Brenner MK', 'Melo JV', 'Goldman JM', 'Stauss HJ']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom. amrolp1@gosh.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0525 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57032-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1007-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0525.

In the 1992 trial of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG), the amount of residual leukemic blasts in bone marrow was assessed one week after the first induction course (day 16 blasts). A total of 449 patients 16 to 76 years of age (median, 53 years) with de novo AML entered the trial and were evaluable. Treatment included TAD/HAM (thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside, and daunorubicin/high-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone) double induction, TAD consolidation, and randomly either maintenance therapy or S-HAM consolidation. Cytogenetics were favorable, intermediate, unfavorable and not available in 10.0%, 48.3%, 13.1%, and 28.5%, respectively. Day 16 blasts ranged from 0% to 100% (median, 5%, mean +/- SD, 18.6 +/- 28.5%). Complete remission (CR) rate was 72.6%, 17.6% had persistent leukemia (PL), and 9.8% succumbed to hypoplastic death. Median overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 18, 9, and 15 months with 28.4%, 21.6%, and 30.1% at 5 years, respectively.

The rationale behind NST is to induce optimal graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects for elimination of all malignant cells by donor alloreactive immunocompetent cells as an alternative to standard high-dose myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. NST based on the use of fludarabine, low-dose busulfan, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) was employed in 24 patients aged 3 to 63 years with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase (CP). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of low-dose cyclosporine (CSP), in some cases with low-dose methotrexate. Early discontinuation of CSP was attempted in cases of mixed chimerism in an attempt to amplify GVL effects. All 24 patients showed rapid 3-lineage engraftment, mostly without complete aplasia; 6 patients did not require transfusion of any blood products. NST was associated with minimal procedure-related toxicity. The incidence of acute GVHD (grade I or higher) was 54%; however, this incidence increased following CSP withdrawal. After a follow-up of up to 70 months (median, 42 months), 21 of 24 patients remained alive and disease free. The GVL effects induced by donor immunocompetent lymphocytes eradicated all host hematopoietic cells, as evidenced by molecular testing. The Kaplan-Meier probability of survival and disease-free survival at 5 years is 85% +/- 8% (95% confidence interval, 70%-100%). NST may successfully replace myeloablative stem cell transplantation, providing a safer, well-tolerated therapeutic option for all patients with CML in first CP with a matched donor. However, this conclusion must be tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial.","['Or, Reuven', 'Shapira, Michael Y', 'Resnick, Igor', 'Amar, Avraham', 'Ackerstein, Aliza', 'Samuel, Simcha', 'Aker, Memet', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Or R', 'Shapira MY', 'Resnick I', 'Amar A', 'Ackerstein A', 'Samuel S', 'Aker M', 'Naparstek E', 'Nagler A', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0535 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44496-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):441-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0535.

PI-3K is activated by many stimuli and is linked to several different signaling pathways. We demonstrated that inhibition of PI-3K by a specific inhibitor, LY294002, induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells in vitro. This effect was specific for the inhibition of PI-3K because inhibition of other signaling pathways such as extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, or p70S6 kinase did not affect spontaneous apoptosis. Furthermore, PI-3K was constitutively activated in freshly isolated B-CLL cells. Corresponding to enhanced apoptosis, LY294002 down-regulated expression of the antiapoptotic proteins X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and Mcl-1. Next, we investigated which factors downstream of PI-3K were activated in B-CLL cells. We demonstrated that protein kinase B/Akt is expressed in all tested CLL samples but no activation of Akt was detected. In contrast, we observed a constitutive activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) in freshly isolated B-CLL cells. PKCdelta is linked to PI-3K and is phosphorylated at Thr505 in response to PI-3K activation. We further demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of PKCdelta were dependent on PI-3K activity in B-CLL cells. Inhibition of PKCdelta by the specific inhibitor Rottlerin strikingly enhanced apoptosis. In contrast, peripheral blood B cells of healthy donors were resistant to inhibition of PI-3K or PKCdelta. We conclude that activated PI-3K might be important in the pathogenesis of B-CLL, and survival signals might be mediated via PKCdelta. Therefore, inhibition of PI-3K or PKCdelta may be an innovative approach to treat B-CLL.","['Ringshausen, Ingo', 'Schneller, Folker', 'Bogner, Christian', 'Hipp, Susanne', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Decker, Thomas']","['Ringshausen I', 'Schneller F', 'Bogner C', 'Hipp S', 'Duyster J', 'Peschel C', 'Decker T']","['Third Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany. i.ringshausen@lrz.tum.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Signal Transduction']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0539 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54138-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3741-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0539.

A total of 350 patients with newly diagnosed APL were randomized to either daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) or ATRA for induction and then either ATRA maintenance or observation following consolidation chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) rates were not significantly different between the ATRA and DA groups (70% and 73%, respectively). However, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer with ATRA than with DA for induction (69% vs 29% and 69% vs 45%, respectively). Based on both induction and maintenance randomizations, the 5-year DFS was 16% for patients randomized to DA and observation, 47% for DA and ATRA, 55% for ATRA and observation, and 74% for ATRA and ATRA. There was no advantage of either induction regimen among any subgroups when CR alone was considered. However, female sex, classical M3 morphology (vs the microgranular variant [M3v]), and treatment-white blood cell count (WBC) interaction (ATRA/WBC below 2 x 10(9)/L [2000/microL] best, DA/WBC above 2 x 10(9)/L worst) were each significantly associated with improved DFS (P <.05). Treatment with ATRA, WBC below 2 x 10(9)/L, and absence of bleeding disorder were each significantly associated with improved OS. Age more than 15 years, female sex, and treatment-morphology interaction (DA/M3v worst, ATRA best regardless of morphology) were each significantly associated with improved DFS based on maintenance randomization. The improvement in outcome with ATRA in APL was maintained with long-term follow-up.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Andersen, Janet W', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Feusner, James H', 'Woods, William G', 'Ogden, Angela', 'Weinstein, Howard', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Willman, Cheryl', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Wiernik, Peter H']","['Tallman MS', 'Andersen JW', 'Schiffer CA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Feusner JH', 'Woods WG', 'Ogden A', 'Weinstein H', 'Shepherd L', 'Willman C', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Rowe JM', 'Wiernik PH']","['Northwestern University, Feinburg School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Robert H.

To determine the prognostic significance of early Bcr-Abl levels and changes in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), serial samples of 56 patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) ALL treated in phase 2 trials of imatinib were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Imatinib induced a complete hematologic response (CHR) or complete marrow response (marrow-CR) in 40 patients (good responders) and a partial (n = 2) or no (n = 14) remission in the remaining patients (poor responders). Compared with baseline, the median Bcr-Abl/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ratios decreased significantly in PB by 2.65, 2.64, and 3.11 log steps after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and at the time of best response, respectively. In BM, the decline of median Bcr-Abl/GAPDH was 0.75, 1.37, and 2.78 logs, respectively. Thus, Bcr-Abl levels decreased more rapidly in PB than in BM (median time to best level 31 vs 39 days). Low Bcr-Abl/GAPDH ratios below 10(-4) in PB and below 10(-2) in BM after 2 weeks were significantly associated with good responses after 4 weeks. Moreover, Bcr-Abl levels (< 10(-2)) in BM of good responders after 4 weeks discriminated between 2 groups of patients with significantly different median time to progression (139 vs 22 days). The data show that Bcr-Abl levels in PB and BM after 2 weeks of imatinib treatment and in BM after 4 weeks have predictive relevance and may guide the application of additional therapies.","['Scheuring, Urban J', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Bruck, Patrick', 'Atta, Johannes', 'Petershofen, Eduard K', 'Gehrke, Brigitte', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Scheuring UJ', 'Pfeifer H', 'Wassmann B', 'Bruck P', 'Atta J', 'Petershofen EK', 'Gehrke B', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany. scheuring@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/mortality', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Salvage Therapy']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0360 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53566-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 1;101(1):85-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0360.

Two of these partner genes code for members of the forkhead subfamily of transcription factors designated FKHRL1 and AFX. We demonstrate here that MLL-FKHRL1 enhances the self-renewal of murine myeloid progenitors in vitro and induces acute myeloid leukemias in syngeneic mice. The long latency (mean = 157 days), reduced penetrance, and hematologic features of the leukemias were very similar to those observed for the forkhead fusion protein MLL-AFX and contrasted with the more aggressive features of leukemias induced by MLL-AF10. Transformation mediated by MLL-forkhead fusion proteins required 2 conserved transcriptional effector domains (CR2 and CR3), each of which alone was not sufficient to activate MLL. A synthetic fusion of MLL with FKHR, a third mammalian forkhead family member that contains both effector domains, was also capable of transforming hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. A comparable requirement for 2 distinct transcriptional effector domains was also displayed by VP16, which required its proximal minimal transactivation domain (MTD/H1) and distal H2 domain to activate the oncogenic potential of MLL. The functional importance of CR2 was further demonstrated by its ability to substitute for H2 of VP16 in domain-swapping experiments to confer oncogenic activity on MLL. Our results, based on bona fide transcription factors as partners for MLL, unequivocally establish a transcriptional effector mechanism to activate its oncogenic potential and further support a role for fusion partners in determining pathologic features of the leukemia phenotype.","['So, Chi Wai', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['So CW', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1785 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44523-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):633-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1785.

However, the biologic differences correlating with V(H) gene status that could determine the clinical course of the disease are unknown. Here we show that differing responses to IgM ligation are closely associated with V(H) gene status. Specifically, 80% of cases with unmutated V(H) genes showed increased global tyrosine phosphorylation following IgM ligation, whereas only 20% of samples with mutated V(H) genes responded (P =.0002). There was also an association between response to IgM ligation and expression of CD38 (P =.015). The Syk kinase, critical for transducing B-cell receptor (BCR)- derived signals, was constitutively present in all CLL samples, and there was a perfect association between global phosphorylation and induction of phosphorylation/activation of Syk. Nonresponsiveness to anti-IgM could be circumvented by ligation of IgD (10 of 15 samples tested) or the BCR-associated molecule CD79alpha (12 of 15 samples tested). These results suggest that multiple mechanisms underlie nonresponsiveness to anti-IgM in CLL and that retained responsiveness to anti-IgM contributes to the poor prognosis associated with the unmutated subset of CLL. The prognostic power of the in vitro response to IgM ligation remains to be determined in a large series, but the simple technology involved may present an alternative or additional test for predicting clinical course.","['Lanham, Stuart', 'Hamblin, Terry', 'Oscier, David', 'Ibbotson, Rachel', 'Stevenson, Freda', 'Packham, Graham']","['Lanham S', 'Hamblin T', 'Oscier D', 'Ibbotson R', 'Stevenson F', 'Packham G']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Research Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Syk Kinase']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1822 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57042-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1087-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1822.

Flow cytometric analysis carried out with a panel of anti-CTLA-4 human single-chain fragment of variable domain (scFv) antibodies revealed that CTLA-4 was not expressed on the surface, whereas it was highly expressed within the cytoplasm, in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T cells, B cells, CD34(+) stem cells, and granulocytes. Various treatments with agents able to specifically activate each cell type induced CTLA-4 expression on the surface of these cells. Similarly, increased CTLA-4 expression was observed in different hematopoietic cell lines although they also expressed surface CTLA-4, at different degrees of intensity, before activation. Surprisingly, CTLA-4 RNA transcripts were detectable in such cell lines only after nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for CTLA-4 extracellular domain, suggesting a very fast CTLA-4 RNA processing accompanied by prolonged CTLA-4 protein accumulation. We further demonstrated surface expression of CTLA-4 in a variety of acute and chronic myeloid leukemias (AMLs and CMLs) and B- and T-lymphoid leukemias, either adult or pediatric. CTLA-4 was expressed in 25% to 85% of AMLs and CMLs depending on the leukemia subtype and the epitope analyzed, whereas in acute B- and T-leukemias CTLA-4 expression was mainly cytoplasmic. Chronic B leukemias appeared to express CTLA-4, both on the surface and in cytoplasm, whereas few cases tested of chronic T leukemias were negative. Two anti-CTLA-4 immunotoxins (scFvs-saporin) induced in vitro apoptosis of neoplastic cells from a representative AML, suggesting a novel immunotherapeutic approach to AML based on CTLA-4 targeting.","['Pistillo, Maria Pia', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Palmisano, Giulio Lelio', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Bolognesi, Andrea', 'Ferlito, Francesca', 'Capanni, Paolo', 'Polito, Letizia', 'Ratta, Marina', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Piccioli, Milena', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Rissotto, Laura', 'Conte, Roberto', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Stirpe, Fiorenzo', 'Ferrara, Giovanni Battista']","['Pistillo MP', 'Tazzari PL', 'Palmisano GL', 'Pierri I', 'Bolognesi A', 'Ferlito F', 'Capanni P', 'Polito L', 'Ratta M', 'Pileri S', 'Piccioli M', 'Basso G', 'Rissotto L', 'Conte R', 'Gobbi M', 'Stirpe F', 'Ferrara GB']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics and Laboratory of Molecular Morphogenesis, National Cancer Research Institute, Advanced Biotechnology Center, Genoa, Italy. mariapia.pistillo@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Abatacept', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blood Cells', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunotoxins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1668 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53584-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 1;101(1):202-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1668.

CLL B cells that have nonmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes (V genes) expressed levels of ZAP-70 protein that were comparable to those expressed by normal blood T cells. In contrast, CLL B cells that had mutated immunoglobulin variable V genes, or that had low-level expression of CD38, generally did not express detectable amounts of ZAP-70 protein. Leukemia cells from identical twins with CLL were found discordant for expression of ZAP-70, suggesting that B-cell expression of ZAP-70 is not genetically predetermined. Ligation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex on CLL cells that expressed ZAP-70 induced significantly greater tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins, including p72(Syk), than did similar stimulation of CLL cells that did not express ZAP-70. Also, exceptional cases of CLL cells that expressed mutated immunoglobulin V genes and ZAP-70 also experienced higher levels tyrosine phosphorylation of such cytosolic proteins following BCR ligation. Following BCR ligation, ZAP-70 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and became associated with surface immunoglobulin and CD79b, arguing for the involvement of ZAP-70 in BCR signaling. These data indicate that expression of ZAP-70 is associated with enhanced signal transduction via the BCR complex, which may contribute to the more aggressive clinical course associated with CLL cells that express nonmutated immunoglobulin receptors.","['Chen, Liguang', 'Widhopf, George', 'Huynh, Lang', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Weiss, Arthur', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Chen L', 'Widhopf G', 'Huynh L', 'Rassenti L', 'Rai KR', 'Weiss A', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego for the CLL Research Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1683 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53671-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4609-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1683.

Recently, we demonstrated that the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (Rapa) specifically induces apoptosis in DCs but not in other myeloid cell types. The present study unraveled the mechanism used by Rapa to induce apoptosis in human monocyte-derived DCs. Our data demonstrate that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) preserves DC survival specifically via the phosphatidylinositol-3 lipid kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) signaling pathway, which is abrogated by Rapa at the level of mTOR. Disruption of this GM-CSF signaling pathway induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, phosphatidyl-serine exposure, and nuclear changes. Apoptosis of these nonproliferating DCs was preceded by an up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1). Overexpression of p27(KIP1) in DCs using adenoviral gene transduction revealed that apoptosis is directly regulated by p27(KIP1). Furthermore, both overexpression of p27(KIP1) and disruption of the GM-CSF/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway decreased the expression of the antiapoptotic protein mcl-1. This mTOR/p27(KIP1)/mcl-1 survival seems unique for DCs and may provide novel opportunities to influence immune responses by specific interference with the life span of these cells.","['Woltman, Andrea M', 'van der Kooij, Sandra W', 'Coffer, Paul J', 'Offringa, Rienk', 'Daha, Mohamed R', 'van Kooten, Cees']","['Woltman AM', 'van der Kooij SW', 'Coffer PJ', 'Offringa R', 'Daha MR', 'van Kooten C']","['Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. a.m.woltman@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1688 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57409-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1439-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1688.

To define steps in the commitment to blood cell fate, we compared wild-type and SCL(-/-) embryonic stem cell differentiation in vitro and identified CD41 (GpIIb) as the earliest surface marker missing from SCL(-/-) embryoid bodies (EBs). Culture of fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) purified cells from EBs showed that definitive hematopoietic progenitors were highly enriched in the CD41(+) fraction, whereas endothelial cells developed from CD41(-) cells. In the mouse embryo, expression of CD41 was detected in yolk sac blood islands and in fetal liver. In yolk sac and EBs, the panhematopoietic marker CD45 appeared in a subpopulation of CD41(+) cells. However, multilineage hematopoietic colonies developed not only from CD45(+)CD41(+) cells but also from CD45(-)CD41(+) cells, suggesting that CD41 rather than CD45 marks the definitive culture colony-forming unit (CFU-C) at the embryonic stage. In contrast, fetal liver CFU-C was CD45(+), and only a subfraction expressed CD41, demonstrating down-regulation of CD41 by the fetal liver stage. In yolk sac and EBs, CD41 was coexpressed with embryonic HSC markers c-kit and CD34. Sorting for CD41 and c-kit expression resulted in enrichment of definitive hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the CD41(+) c-kit(+) population was missing from runx1/AML1(-/-) EBs that lack definitive hematopoiesis. These results suggest that the expression of CD41, a candidate target gene of SCL/Tal1, and c-kit define the divergence of definitive hematopoiesis from endothelial cells during development. Although CD41 is commonly referred to as megakaryocyte-platelet integrin in adult hematopoiesis, these results implicate a wider role for CD41 during murine ontogeny.","['Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Fujiwara, Yuko', 'Schlaeger, Thorsten M', 'Traver, David', 'Orkin, Stuart H']","['Mikkola HK', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Schlaeger TM', 'Traver D', 'Orkin SH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', 'Endothelium/cytology/embryology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Yolk Sac/cytology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1699 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44507-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):508-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1699.

Here, we report that exogenous expression of AML1-ETO in human CD34(+) cells severely disrupts normal erythropoiesis, resulting in virtual abrogation of erythroid colony formation. In contrast, in bulk liquid culture of purified erythroid cells, we found that while AML1-ETO initially inhibited proliferation during early (erythropoietin [EPO]-independent) erythropoiesis, growth inhibition gave way to a sustained EPO-independent expansion of early erythroid cells that continued for more than 60 days, whereas control cultures became growth arrested after 10 to 13 days (at the EPO-dependent stage of development). Phenotypic analysis showed that although these cells were CD13(-) and CD34(-), unlike control cultures, these cells failed to up-regulate CD36 or to down-regulate CD33, suggesting that expression of AML1-ETO suppressed the differentiation of these cells and allowed extensive self-renewal to occur. In the early stages of this expansion, addition of EPO was able to promote both phenotypic (CD36(+), CD33(-), glycophorin A(+)) and morphologic differentiation of these cells, almost as effectively as in control cultures. However, with extended culture, cells expressing AML1-ETO became refractory to addition of this cytokine, suggesting that a block in differentiation had been established. These data demonstrate the capacity of AML1-ETO to promote the self-renewal of human hematopoietic cells and therefore support a causal role for t(8;21) translocations in leukemogenesis.","['Tonks, Alex', 'Pearn, Lorna', 'Tonks, Amanda J', 'Pearce, Laurence', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Phillips, Sarah', 'Fisher, Janet', 'Downing, James R', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Darley, Richard L']","['Tonks A', 'Pearn L', 'Tonks AJ', 'Pearce L', 'Hoy T', 'Phillips S', 'Fisher J', 'Downing JR', 'Burnett AK', 'Darley RL']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom. tonksa@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1732 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44522-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):624-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1732.

The paternal allele exhibited the common PKLR cDNA sequence (c.) 1529G>A mutation, known to be associated with PK deficiency. On the maternal allele, 3 in cis mutations were identified in the erythroid-specific promoter region of the gene: one deletion of thymine -248 and 2 single nucleotide substitutions, nucleotide (nt) -324T>A and nt -83G>C. Analysis of the patient's RNA demonstrated the presence of only the 1529A allele, indicating severely reduced transcription from the allele linked to the mutated promoter region. Transfection of promoter constructs into erythroleukemic K562 cells showed that the most upstream -324T>A and -248delT mutations were nonfunctional polymorphisms. In contrast, the -83G>C mutation strongly reduced promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the promoter region revealed the presence of a putative regulatory element (PKR-RE1) whose core binding motif, CTCTG, is located between nt -87 and nt -83. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using K562 nuclear extracts indicated binding of an as-yet-unidentified trans-acting factor.

In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulation of the CBS gene in the DS megakaryocytic leukemia (AMkL) cell line, CMK, characterized by significantly higher CBS transcripts compared with the non-DS AMkL cell line, CMS. Rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends (5'-RACE) analysis demonstrated exclusive use of the CBS -1b promoter in the cell lines, and transient transfections with the full-length CBS -1b luciferase reporter gene construct showed 40-fold greater promoter activity in the CMK than CMS cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed enhanced binding of the transcription factors Sp1/Sp3 to 2 GC/GT-box elements (GC-f and GT-d) in the upstream regions of the CBS -1b promoter in CMK nuclear extracts and undetectable binding in CMS cells. Mutation of the GC-f- or GT-d-binding site resulted in an approximately 90% decrease of the CBS -1b promoter activity in transient transfections of CMK cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed in vivo binding of Sp3, USF-1, and nuclear factor YA (NF-YA) to the CBS -1b promoter region in chromatin extracts of CMK and CMS cells. Decreased binding of Sp1/Sp3 in CMK nuclear extracts following treatment with calf alkaline phosphatase suggested a role for phosphorylation of Sp1/Sp3 in regulating CBS promoter activity and in the differential CBS expression between CMK and CMS cells. The results of this study with clinically relevant cell line models suggest potential mechanisms for disparate patterns of CBS gene expression in DS and non-DS myeloblasts and may, in part, explain the greater sensitivity to chemotherapy shown by patients with DS AML.","['Ge, Yubin', 'Jensen, Tanya L', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Ge Y', 'Jensen TL', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW']","[""Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cystathionine beta-Synthase/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*enzymology/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2337 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57424-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1551-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2337.

In addition to the GVL effect, the administration of donor HSV-tk(+) cells could have a clinical impact in promoting immune reconstitution after T-cell-depleted stem cell transplantation (SCT). To explore this hypothesis, we have investigated whether in vitro polyclonal activation, retroviral transduction, immunoselection, and expansion affect the immune competence of donor T cells. We have observed that, after appropriate in vitro manipulation, T cells specific for antigens relevant in the context of SCT are preserved in terms of frequency, expression of T-cell receptor, proliferation, cytokine secretion, and lytic activity. A reduction in the frequency of allospecific T-cell precursors is observed after prolonged T-cell culture, suggesting that cell manipulation protocols involving a short culture time and high transduction efficiency are needed. Finally, the long-term persistence of HSV-tk(+) cells was observed in a patient treated in the GVL clinical trial, and a reversion of the phenotype of HSV-tk(+) cells from CD45RO(+) to CD45RA(+) was documented more than 2 years after the infusion. Based on all this evidence, we propose a clinical study of preemptive infusions of donor HSV-tk(+) T cells after SCT from haploidentical donors to provide early immune reconstitution against infection and potential immune protection against disease recurrence.","['Marktel, Sarah', 'Magnani, Zulma', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Cazzaniga, Sabrina', 'Riddell, Stanley R', 'Traversari, Catia', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Bonini, Chiara']","['Marktel S', 'Magnani Z', 'Ciceri F', 'Cazzaniga S', 'Riddell SR', 'Traversari C', 'Bordignon C', 'Bonini C']","['Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Istituto Scientifico H.

Here we report that quiescent CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes do not express this receptor, as monitored with a soluble receptor-binding domain derived from the HTLV envelope. However, HTLV receptor is an early activation marker in neonatal and adult T lymphocytes, detected as early as 4 hours following T-cell-receptor (TCR) stimulation. This induced surface expression of the HTLV receptor requires de novo protein synthesis and results in a wide distribution on the surface of activated lymphocytes. Moreover, the distribution of the HTLV receptor is independent of TCR/CD3-capped membrane structures, as observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. To determine whether HTLV receptor up-regulation specifically requires TCR-mediated signals or, alternatively, is dependent on more generalized cell cycle entry/proliferation signals, its expression was monitored in interleukin 7 (IL-7)-stimulated neonatal and adult T cells. Neonatal, but not adult, lymphocytes proliferate in response to IL-7 and HTLV receptor expression is restricted to the former population. Thus, HTLV receptor expression appears to be an early marker of cell cycle entry. Up-regulation of the HTLV receptor, via signals transmitted through the IL-7 cytokine receptor as well as the TCR, is likely to contribute to the mother-to-infant transmission and spreading of HTLV-1.","['Manel, Nicolas', 'Kinet, Sandrina', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Kim, Felix J', 'Taylor, Naomi', 'Sitbon, Marc']","['Manel N', 'Kinet S', 'Battini JL', 'Kim FJ', 'Taylor N', 'Sitbon M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5535/IFR 24, F-34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Genes, env', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2681 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50888-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1913-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2681.

Here we report the molecular cloning of leukocyte-specific STAT-induced GPCR (LSSIG), which is a novel murine orphan GPCR with the highest homology to human GPR43. The mRNA expression of LSSIG was clearly induced in M1 leukemia cells during the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced differentiation to macrophages, and the induction was evidently signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent. GPR43 expression was also strongly induced in HL-60 and U937 leukemia cells during the differentiation to monocytes.

We hypothesized that down-regulation of Bcl-2 would restore chemosensitivity in leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase 1 study of G3139 (Genasense, Genta, Berkeley Heights, NJ), an 18-mer phosphorothioate Bcl-2 antisense, with fludarabine (FL), cytarabine (ARA-C), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG) salvage chemotherapy in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia. Twenty patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. G3139 was delivered by continuous infusion on days 1 to 10. FLAG chemotherapy was administered on days 5 to 10. Common side effects of this combination included fever, nausea, emesis, electrolyte imbalance, and fluid retention that were not dose limiting. Plasma pharmacokinetics of G3139 demonstrated steady-state concentration (Css) within 24 hours. Of the 20 patients, 9 (45%) had disease response, 6 (5 AML, 1 ALL) with complete remission (CR) and 3 (2 AML and 1 ALL) with no evidence of disease but failure to recover normal neutrophil and/or platelet counts or to remain in remission for at least 30 days (incomplete remission). Bcl-2 mRNA levels were down-regulated in 9 of the 12 (75%) evaluable patients. This study demonstrates that G3139 can be administered safely with FLAG chemotherapy and down-regulate its target, Bcl-2. The encouraging clinical and laboratory results justify the current plans for a phase 3 study in previously untreated high-risk AML (ie, age at least 60 years).","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Byrd, John C', 'Dai, Guowei', 'Klisovic, Marko I', 'Kourlas, Peter J', 'Young, Donn C', 'Cataland, Spero R', 'Fisher, Diane B', 'Lucas, David', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Lin, Zhong-Pin', 'Farag, Sherif F', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'Zwiebel, James A', 'Kraut, Eric H', 'Balcerzak, Stanley P', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Marcucci G', 'Byrd JC', 'Dai G', 'Klisovic MI', 'Kourlas PJ', 'Young DC', 'Cataland SR', 'Fisher DB', 'Lucas D', 'Chan KK', 'Porcu P', 'Lin ZP', 'Farag SF', 'Frankel SR', 'Zwiebel JA', 'Kraut EH', 'Balcerzak SP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Grever MR', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA. marcucci-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Thionucleotides/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1899 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44494-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):425-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1899.

Because these proteins show restricted normal tissue distribution, they are usually highly immunogenic and may be potential targets for immunotherapy. In the present study, we have used a pair of sequence-specific primers in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence analysis to demonstrate that the X-linked gene encoding SPAN-Xb is expressed in multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that SPAN-Xb is a cancer/testis antigen and shows a restricted normal tissue expression. It is not expressed in any normal tissue except testis. SPAN-Xb recombinant protein was produced and used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. High-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, of IgG3 or IgG2 subclass, against SPAN-Xb were detectable in the sera of these patients. In contrast, SPAN-Xb mRNA or antibodies could not be detected in any of the healthy donors. There was a good correlation between SPAN-Xb gene expression and B-cell immune responses. These results suggest the in vivo immunogenicity of the SPAN-Xb protein. The presence of high-titer IgG responses suggests that the B-cell responses are likely to have been generated with CD4 T-cell cognitive help. Based on these data, we conclude that SPAN-Xb is a novel member of the family of cancer/testis antigens aberrantly expressed by, and capable of inducing, immune responses in patients with multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies.","['Wang, Zhiqing', 'Zhang, Yana', 'Liu, Haichao', 'Salati, Emanuela', 'Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Wang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu H', 'Salati E', 'Chiriva-Internati M', 'Lim SH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/blood', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1930 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57025-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):955-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1930.

Augmenting the GVL effect by the adoptive transfer of donor-derived B-ALL-specific T-cell clones is a conceptually attractive strategy to decrease relapse rates without exacerbating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Toward this end, we investigated whether a genetic engineering approach could render CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for tumor cells that express the B-cell lineage cell surface molecule CD19. This was accomplished by the genetic modification of CTLs to express a chimeric immunoreceptor composed of a CD19-specific single-chain immunoglobulin extracellular targeting domain fused to a CD3-zeta intracellular signaling domain. CD19-redirected CTL clones display potent CD19-specific lytic activity and chimeric immunoreceptor-regulated cytokine production and proliferation. Because B-ALL cells can evade T-cell/natural killer- cell recognition by down-regulation of cell surface accessory molecules that participate in the formation of a functional immunologic synapse, we compared the CD19-specific effector function of genetically modified CD8(+) CTLs toward CD19(+) cells with disparate levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and LFA-3. We observed that recognition of B-lineage tumor lines by CD19-specific CTLs was not impaired by low levels of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and LFA-3 cell surface expression, a functional attribute that is likely a consequence of our high-affinity CD19-specific chimeric immunoreceptor. Furthermore, the CD19-specific CTLs could lyse primary B-ALL blasts. These preclinical observations form the basis for implementing clinical trials using donor-derived CD19-specific T-cell clones to treat or prevent relapse of B-ALL after allogeneic HSCT.","['Cooper, Laurence J N', 'Topp, Max S', 'Serrano, Lisa Marie', 'Gonzalez, Sergio', 'Chang, Wen-Chung', 'Naranjo, Araceli', 'Wright, Christine', 'Popplewell, Leslie', 'Raubitschek, Andrew', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Jensen, Michael C']","['Cooper LJ', 'Topp MS', 'Serrano LM', 'Gonzalez S', 'Chang WC', 'Naranjo A', 'Wright C', 'Popplewell L', 'Raubitschek A', 'Forman SJ', 'Jensen MC']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. lcooper@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'CD58 Antigens/analysis', 'Clone Cells/*immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Transfection']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-1989 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57436-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 15;101(4):1637-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-1989.

Through the transplantation of transduced murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we show that a vector incorporating a 342-base pair (bp) fragment of 5' flanking sequence from the CD68 gene, in addition to the CD68 first intron, was able to direct macrophage-specific expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene in inflammatory cell exudates and lymphoid organs in vivo. Levels of EGFP expression generated by this vector were greater than those generated by a standard Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector, and they were stable for at least a year after transplantation of transduced HSCs. To evaluate the ability of this vector to generate therapeutically useful levels of gene expression, we transplanted apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient HSCs transduced with a virus encoding ApoE into ApoE-deficient mice. Macrophages from these mice expressed levels of ApoE that were comparable to those from wild-type mice, and vector-driven expression of ApoE in macrophages was sufficient to reverse both hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic lesion development.

Here we show that BCR-ABL transduction of primitive Sca-1(+) lin(-) mouse bone marrow (BM) cells causes immediate activation of IL-3, G-CSF, and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression in these cells. Their autocrine IL-3-mediated growth dependence is thus demonstrable only in clonal cultures where paracrine effects are reduced. Interestingly, upon continued culture, these cells produce large populations of rapidly proliferating mast cells in which only the IL-3 autocrine mechanism is consistently maintained, together with evidence of hyperphosphorylation of p210(BCR-ABL) and STAT5 and retention of a multilineage but attenuated in vivo leukemogenic potential characterized by a prolonged latency. BCR-ABL transduction of IL-3(-/-) Sca-1(+) lin(-) BM cells initially activates GM-CSF and G-CSF production, factor independence, and the ability to generate phenotypically indistinguishable populations of mast cells.

Early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection is difficult, suggesting that antifungal prophylaxis could be the best approach for neutropenic patients undergoing intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Consequently, antifungal prophylaxis has been extensively studied for more than 20 years. Nonabsorbable polyenes reduce superficial mycoses but are not effective in preventing or treating invasive fungal infections. Intravenous amphotericin B and the newer azoles were used in numerous clinical trials, but the value of antifungal prophylaxis in defined risk groups with cancer is still open to discussion. Recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants and patients with a relapsed leukemia are high-risk patient populations. In addition, certain risk factors are well defined, for example, neutropenia more than 10 days, corticosteroid therapy, sustained immunosuppression, and graft-versus-host disease. In contrast to study efforts, evidence-based recommendations on the clinical use of antifungal prophylaxis according to risk groups are rare. The objective of this review of 50 studies accumulating more than 9000 patients is to assess evidence-based criteria with regard to the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic cancer patients.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Karthaus, Meinolf']","['Cornely OA', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Karthaus M']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Klinikum der Universitat Koln, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Carriers', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Liposomes', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1356 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50711-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3365-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1356.

Here, we describe the consequences of ectopic mutant N-Ras (N-Ras*) expression on normal human erythropoiesis. We show that during early (erythropoietin [EPO]-independent) erythropoiesis, N-Ras* promoted the amplification of a phenotypically primitive but functionally defective subpopulation of CD34(+) erythroblasts. N-Ras* also up-regulated the expression of megakaryocyte antigens on human erythroblasts. Although early erythroblasts expressing N-Ras* were able to respond to erythropoietin and generate mature progeny, this occurred with greatly reduced efficiency, probably explaining the poor colony growth characteristics of these cells. We further report that this oncogene promoted the expression and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and that the effects of N-Ras* on erythropoiesis could be abrogated or attenuated by inhibition of PKC. Similarly, the effects of this oncogene could be partially mimicked by treatment with PKC agonist. Together, these data suggest that expression of N-Ras* is able to subvert the normal developmental cues that regulate erythropoiesis by activating PKC. This gives rise to phenotypic and functional abnormalities commonly observed in preleukemia, suggesting a direct link between RAS mutations and the pathogenesis of preleukemia.","['Darley, Richard L', 'Pearn, Lorna', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Sweeney, Marion', 'Fisher, Janet', 'Phillips, Sarah', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Burnett, Alan K']","['Darley RL', 'Pearn L', 'Omidvar N', 'Sweeney M', 'Fisher J', 'Phillips S', 'Hoy T', 'Burnett AK']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Differentiation Group, Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom. darley@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Mutation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/drug effects', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1358 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51378-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 1;100(12):4185-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1358.

Thus, we generated a human packaging cell line with a gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype (Phoenix-GALV), and we evaluated vectors produced by Phoenix-GALV for their ability to transduce hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. In 3 baboons, we used a competitive repopulation assay to directly compare GALV-pseudotype retrovirus vectors produced by either Phoenix-GALV or by the NIH 3T3-derived packaging cell line, PG13. In 3 additional baboons we compared Phoenix-GALV-derived vectors to more recently developed lentiviral vectors. Gene transfer efficiency into hematopoietic repopulating cells was assessed by evaluating the number of genetically modified peripheral blood and marrow cells using flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transduction efficiency of hematopoietic repopulating cells was significantly higher using the Phoenix-GALV-derived vector as compared with the PG13-derived vectors or lentiviral vectors, with stable transduction levels up to 25%. We followed 2 animals for more than one year. Flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic subpopulations in these animals revealed transgene expression in CD13(+) granulocytes, CD20(+) B lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD61(+) platelets, as well as red blood cells, indicating multilineage engraftment of cells transduced by Phoenix-GALV-pseudotype vectors.

These factors, particularly C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon, have important roles in normal myelopoiesis. In addition, loss of C/EBP activity appears to have a role in the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML in which a role for C/EBPs has been postulated. In almost all cases of APL, a promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein is expressed as a result of a t(15;17)(q22;q12) chromosomal translocation. PML-RARalpha inhibits expression of C/EBPepsilon, whereas all-trans retinoic acid (tRA), a differentiating agent to which APL is particularly susceptible, induces C/EBPepsilon expression. PML-RARalpha may also inhibit C/EBPalpha activity. Thus, the effects of PML-RARalpha on C/EBPs may contribute to both the development of leukemia and the unique sensitivity of APL to tRA. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the activity of C/EBPs would revert the leukemic phenotype. C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon were introduced into the FDC-P1 myeloid cell line and into leukemic cells from PML-RARA transgenic mice. C/EBP factors suppressed growth and induced partial differentiation in vitro. In vivo, enhanced expression of C/EBPs prolonged survival. By using a tamoxifen-responsive version of C/EBPepsilon, we observed that C/EBPepsilon could mimic the effect of tRA, driving neutrophilic differentiation in leukemic animals. Our results support the hypothesis that induction of C/EBP activity is a critical effect of tRA in APL. Furthermore, our findings suggest that targeted modulation of C/EBP activities could provide a new approach to therapy of AML.","['Truong, Bao-Tran H', 'Lee, Young-Jin', 'Lodie, Tracey A', 'Park, Dorothy J', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Watanabe, Naohide', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Truong BT', 'Lee YJ', 'Lodie TA', 'Park DJ', 'Perrotti D', 'Watanabe N', 'Koeffler HP', 'Nakajima H', 'Tenen DG', 'Kogan SC']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0128, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1374 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57048-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1141-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1374.

Retroviral insertion mutagenesis in mice has become a powerful tool to identify candidate genes involved in the development of leukemia and lymphoma. We have used this strategy with the 1.4 strain of Graffi murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which predominantly causes myeloid leukemias. Here, we report that Graffi-1.4-induced AML frequently harbors virus integrations in the gene encoding the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). These integrations occurred in both orientations, and all were located in the 5' promoter region of the gene, 0.5 to 1.5 kb upstream of the major transcriptional start site. Luciferase reporter assays showed that virus integration in this region increases promoter activity and renders it independent of a functional binding site for Sp1, a major transcriptional regulator of YY1. We used the murine 32D model to study the consequence of perturbed YY1 expression for myelopoiesis. YY1 protein levels were high in 32D parental cells maintained in interleukin-3-containing medium, but they dropped when the cells were induced to differentiate by granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Strikingly, G-CSF-induced neutrophilic differentiation was reduced in 32D cell transfectants ectopically expressing YY1. In similar experiments on primary bone marrow cells, enforced YY1 expression blocked the outgrowth of CFU-GM colonies. Increased YY1 expression was seen in some cases of human AML. Collectively, these data imply a possible role of perturbed expression of YY1 in the development of AML through interference with the myeloid differentiation program in the leukemic progenitor cells.","['Erkeland, Stefan J', 'Valkhof, Marijke', 'Heijmans-Antonissen, Claudia', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Hermans, Mirjam H A', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['Erkeland SJ', 'Valkhof M', 'Heijmans-Antonissen C', 'Delwel R', 'Valk PJ', 'Hermans MH', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Oncogenes/genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Integration/genetics/physiology', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1207 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57045-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1111-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1207.

The genetic events involved in CML's progression to acute leukemia remain largely unknown. Recent studies have detected the presence of the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion oncogene in acute leukemia derived from CML patients, which suggests that these 2 oncoproteins may interact and influence CML disease progression. Using in vitro purging of BCR-ABL-transduced mouse bone marrow cells, we can now report that recipients of bone marrow cells engineered to coexpress BCR-ABL with NUP98-HOXA9 develop acute leukemia within 7 to 10 days after transplantation. However, no disease is detected for more than 2 months in mice receiving bone marrow cells expressing either BCR-ABL or NUP98-HOXA9. We also provide evidence of high levels of HOXA9 expressed in leukemic blasts from acute-phase CML patients and that it interacts significantly on a genetic level with BCR-ABL in our in vivo CML model.

Peripheral blood stem cells were associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of MDS/AML (RR = 1.8; P =.12) compared with bone marrow grafts.

We determined risks for IA and outcomes among 1682 patients who received HSCTs between January 1993 and December 1998. Risk factors included host variables (age, underlying disease), transplant variables (stem cell source), and late complications (acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], receipt of corticosteroids, secondary neutropenia, cytomegalovirus [CMV] disease, and respiratory virus infection). We identified risk factors associated with IA early after transplantation (<or= 40 days) and after engraftment (41-180 days). Older patient age was associated with an increased risk during both periods. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase was associated with low risk for early IA compared with other hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Multiple myeloma was associated with an increased risk for postengraftment IA. Use of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related (MR) peripheral blood stem cells conferred protection against early IA compared with use of MR bone marrow, but use of cord blood increased the risk of IA early after transplantation. Factors that increased risks for IA after engraftment included receipt of T cell-depleted or CD34-selected stem cell products, receipt of corticosteroids, neutropenia, lymphopenia, GVHD, CMV disease, and respiratory virus infections. Very late IA (> 6 months after transplantation) was associated with chronic GVHD and CMV disease. These results emphasize the postengraftment timing of IA; risk factor analyses verify previously recognized risk factors (GVHD, receipt of corticosteroids, and neutropenia) and uncover the roles of lymphopenia and viral infections in increasing the incidence of postengraftment IA in the 1990s.","['Marr, Kieren A', 'Carter, Rachel A', 'Boeckh, Michael', 'Martin, Paul', 'Corey, Lawrence']","['Marr KA', 'Carter RA', 'Boeckh M', 'Martin P', 'Corey L']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Programs in Infectious Diseases and Long-term Follow-up, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. kmarr@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1496 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53639-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4358-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1496.

Among these members, cIAP2 expression was selectively up-regulated by stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but not with granulocyte-macrophage CSF. The increased expression of cIAP2 mRNA was detected as early as 30 minutes after in vitro stimulation with G-CSF, and the elevated level of cIAP2 protein was detected at 1 hour. The elevated level of cIAP2 protein was also detected in peripheral blood neutrophils obtained from healthy donors receiving G-CSF administration. G-CSF-induced up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA and protein, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and the antiapoptotic effects were inhibited by pretreatment of cells with AG490, a specific inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Mature neutrophils from a patient with chronic neutrophilic leukemia exhibited remarkable overexpression of cIAP2 mRNA and prolongation of survival, whereas cIAP2 mRNA expression and survival in mature neutrophils from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were essentially similar to those in normal neutrophils. These findings suggest that cIAP2 expression is up-regulated by G-CSF through activation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, and increased expression of cIAP2 protein may contribute to G-CSF-mediated antiapoptosis. In addition, overexpression of cIAP2 may be partly responsible for sustained neutrophilia at least in some cases of chronic neutrophilic leukemia.","['Hasegawa, Taro', 'Suzuki, Kenichi', 'Sakamoto, Chikahiko', 'Ohta, Kensuke', 'Nishiki, Saori', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Tatsumi, Noriyuki', 'Kitagawa, Seiichi']","['Hasegawa T', 'Suzuki K', 'Sakamoto C', 'Ohta K', 'Nishiki S', 'Hino M', 'Tatsumi N', 'Kitagawa S']","['Department of Physiology, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Insect Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/etiology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1505 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57051-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1164-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1505.

They are principally mediated by integrins expressed on B cells and counterreceptors on stromal cells. Specifically, alpha4beta1 integrin engagement rescues B cells from physiological or drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore, in order to understand the mechanisms by which integrins prevent apoptosis in leukemia B cells, we compared the temporal gene expression profiles induced by beta1-integrin ligation with fibronectin (Fn) or adhesion by poly-L-Lysine in serum-starved precursor B leukemia cells. Among the 38 selected differentially expressed genes, 6 genes involved in adhesion (VAV2, EPB41L1, CORO1A), proliferation (FRAP1, CCT4), and intercellular communication (GJB3) were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Gene expression modulation could also be validated at the protein level for 5 other genes. We show that integrin stimulation up-regulated FBI-1 expression but inhibited CD79a, Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 7 induction when the cells underwent apoptosis. We further demonstrate that Fn stimulation also inhibits caspase 3 activation but increases XIAP and survivin expression. Moreover, integrin stimulation also prevents caspase activation induced by doxorubicin. Therefore, we identified genes modulated by adhesion of human precursor B leukemia cells that regulate proliferation and apoptosis, highlighting new pathways that might provide insights into future therapy aiming at targeting apoptosis of leukemia cells.","['Astier, Anne Laurence', 'Xu, Ronghui', 'Svoboda, Marek', 'Hinds, Esther', 'Munoz, Olivier', 'de Beaumont, Rosalie', 'Crean, Colin Daniel', 'Gabig, Theodore', 'Freedman, Arnold Stephen']","['Astier AL', 'Xu R', 'Svoboda M', 'Hinds E', 'Munoz O', 'de Beaumont R', 'Crean CD', 'Gabig T', 'Freedman AS']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Communication/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polylysine/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1519 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57046-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):1118-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1519.

TGF-beta-dependent differentiation of these cells to monocytes, but not retinoic acid-dependent differentiation to granulocytes, was accompanied by rapid phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3. Vitamin D(3) also induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and monocytic differentiation; however the effects were indirect, dependent on its ability to induce expression of TGF-beta1. Simultaneous treatment of these cells with TGF-beta1 and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which leads to almost equal numbers of granulocytes and monocytes, significantly reduced the level of phospho-Smad2/3 and its nuclear accumulation, compared with that in cells treated with TGF-beta1 alone. TGF-beta1 and ATRA activate P42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with nearly identical kinetics, ruling out its involvement in these effects on Smad phosphorylation. Addition of the inhibitor-of-protein serine/threonine phosphatases, okadaic acid, blocks the ATRA-mediated reduction in TGF-beta-induced phospho-Smad2 and shifts the differentiation toward monocytic end points. In HL-60R mutant cells, which harbor a defective retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha), ATRA is unable to reduce levels of TGF-beta-induced phospho-Smad2/3, coincident with its inability to differentiate these cells along granulocytic pathways. Together, these data suggest a new level of cross-talk between ATRA and TGF-beta, whereby a putative RAR-alpha-dependent phosphatase activity limits the levels of phospho-Smad2/3 induced by TGF-beta, ultimately reducing the levels of nuclear Smad complexes mediating the TGF-beta-dependent differentiation of the cells to monocytic end points.","['Cao, Zhouhong', 'Flanders, Kathleen C', 'Bertolette, Daniel', 'Lyakh, Lyudmila A', 'Wurthner, Jens U', 'Parks, W Tony', 'Letterio, John J', 'Ruscetti, Francis W', 'Roberts, Anita B']","['Cao Z', 'Flanders KC', 'Bertolette D', 'Lyakh LA', 'Wurthner JU', 'Parks WT', 'Letterio JJ', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Roberts AB']","['Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1549 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44506-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):498-507. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1549.

Median follow-up was 18 months after CD34(+)-PBSCT and unmanipulated PBSCT and 20 months after BMT. CD34(+)-PBSCT was associated with delayed T-cell immune reconstitution at 3 months and 12 months after transplantation compared with PBSCT (P <.001) or BMT (not significant [NS]). The estimated probability of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 60% +/- 13% for the PBSCT group, 37% +/- 13% for the BMT group, and only 14% +/- 8% for the CD34(+)-PBSCT group (CD34-PBSCT versus BMT, P <.01; and CD34-PBSCT versus PBSCT, P <.001). The probabilities for molecular relapse were 88% for CD34(+)-PBSCT, 55% after BMT, and 37% after PBSCT (CD34(+)-PBSCT versus PBSCT, P <.03). Cytogenetic relapse probability was 58% after CD34(+)-PBSCT, 42% after BMT, and 28% after PBSCT (NS). After CD34(+)-PBSCT, 26 of 32 patients received a T-cell add-back. Hematologic relapse occurred in 4 of 22 patients after BMT, in 3 of 19 patients after PBSCT, and in only 1 of 32 patients after CD34(+)-PBSCT. The occurrence of a hematologic relapse in patients receiving CD34(+)-PBSC transplants was prevented by donor leukocyte infusions, which were applied at a median of 4 times (range, 1-7 times) with a median T-cell dose of 3.3 x 10(6) x kg/body weight [at a median] beginning at day 120 (range, 60-690 days). The estimated probability of 3-year survival after transplantation was 90% in the CD34(+)-PBSCT group, 68% in the PBSCT group, and 63% in the BMT group (CD34-PBSCT versus BMT, P <.01; and CD34-PBSCT versus PBSCT, P <.03).

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a critical role in the immune response in early childhood before specific immune protection develops. We investigated whether there may be an association between childhood ALL and low-producing MBL genotypes. Serum MBL levels depend on normal (A) or defective (O) alleles, and on normal (Y) or reduced (X) promoter activities. For this study, 137 noninfants with ALL and 250 controls were classified into 3 MBL genotype groups according to their influence on the serum level of functional MBL: group I, YA/YA and YA/XA (higher levels); group II, XA/XA and YA/O (intermediate levels); and group III, MBL insufficiency with XA/O or O/O (MBL-deficient) genotypes. Compared with controls, cases more often had low-level genotypes (I/II/III: 63 [46%]/44 [32%]/30 [22%] vs 145 [58%]/65 [26%]/40 [16%]; P =.02) and MBL deficiency (8.8% vs 2.8%; P =.009). Thus, the ALL odds ratio for MBL-deficient versus nondeficient individuals was 3.3 (95% CI, 1.3-8.7), whereas the ALL odds ratio for group I versus group II/III genotypes was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.41-0.94). MBL group III patients were significantly younger at diagnosis than patients in group I/II (median, 3.9 vs 5.2 years; P =.04). The study shows that the presence of low-level MBL genotypes is associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL, particularly with early age at onset.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Garred, Peter', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Andreassen, Bente', 'Petersen, Bodil Laub', 'Madsen, Hans Ole']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Garred P', 'Lausen B', 'Andreassen B', 'Petersen BL', 'Madsen HO']","['Pediatric Clinic II, Juliane Marie Centre, Department of Clinical Immunology, The University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/blood/deficiency/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1627 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54140-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3757-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1627.

Using confocal microscopy we have confirmed our previous observation that heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 leukemia cells (BCR-ABL(+)) express HSP60 and HSP72 on their surface. To explore how the immune system distinguishes stressed from nonstressed apoptotic tumor cells, we analyzed the responses of dendritic cells to these 2 types of apoptotic cells. We found that nonstressed and heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were taken up by dendritic cells in a comparable fashion. However, when stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were coincubated with immature dendritic cells for 24 hours, this resulted in greater up-regulation of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86) on the surface of dendritic cells. Moreover, stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were more effective in stimulating dendritic cells to secrete interleukin-12 (IL-12) and in enhancing their immunostimulatory functions in mixed leukocyte reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that immunization of mice with stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells induced the secretion of T helper-1 (T(H)1) profile of cytokines by spleen cells. Splenocytes from mice immunized with stressed apoptotic cells, but not nonstressed ones, were capable of lysing 12B1-D1 and the parental 12B1 line, but not a B-cell leukemia line, A20.

In this study, we found that ATRA treatment of the APL cell line NB4 induced the expression of CD52, both at transcriptional and translational levels. CD52 is a 21- to 28-kDa nonmodulating cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein expressed on lymphocytes and monocytes, but not in human myeloid cells. The ATRA-dependent induction of CD52 expression was not observed in non-promyelocytic leukemia cell lines such as K562, U937, and HL-60, suggesting that induction of CD52 by ATRA may be specific to leukemic cells that express promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) or are at the promyelocytic stage of myeloid development. Antibodies against CD52 are used therapeutically against lymphocytes in certain leukemias and in patients undergoing transplantation. An ATRA-induced high level of CD52 expression might potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target in treatment of APL.","['Li, Shi-Wu', 'Tang, Dongqi', 'Ahrens, Kim P', 'She, Jin-Xiong', 'Braylan, Raul C', 'Yang, Lijun']","['Li SW', 'Tang D', 'Ahrens KP', 'She JX', 'Braylan RC', 'Yang L']","['Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1426 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50897-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):1977-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1426.

Treatment included intensive double-induction therapy and postremission therapy with high cumulative doses of high-dose cytarabine. ITDs were detected in 32% of the patients and were related to de novo AML and to high white blood cell (WBC) counts, percentages of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) blasts, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Asp835 mutations were present in 14% of the patients and were associated with WBC counts and percentages of PB and BM blasts that were higher than those of patients without FLT3 mutations. With a median follow-up of 34 months, remission duration and overall survival (OS) were significantly shorter for patients with Asp835 mutations or an ITD than for those without FLT3 mutations (P =.03 and P =.0004, respectively). These results were attributable mainly to the negative prognostic effect of FLT3 ITDs. On multivariate analysis, mutant FLT3 was an independent marker affecting remission duration and OS (hazard ratio, 2.35 and 2.11, respectively). Fluorescence in situ hybridization did not detect monoallelic FLT3 deletions in ITD-positive patients. FLT3 mutations identify a subset of young AML patients with normal cytogenetics who do not benefit from intensive chemotherapy, including double-induction and postremission therapy with high-dose cytarabine.","['Frohling, Stefan', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Breitruck, Jochen', 'Benner, Axel', 'Kreitmeier, Sylvia', 'Tobis, Karen', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Frohling S', 'Schlenk RF', 'Breitruck J', 'Benner A', 'Kreitmeier S', 'Tobis K', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Codon/genetics', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1440 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53641-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4372-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1440.

Fifty-four patients with Ph(+) CML in chronic phase and with hematologic or cytogenetic resistance or relapse on imatinib mesylate therapy at 400 mg orally daily were treated with a higher dose of 400 mg orally twice daily (800 mg daily, 47 patients; or 600 mg daily increased from 300 mg daily, 7 patients). Among 20 patients treated for hematologic resistance or relapse, 13 (65%) achieved a complete (n = 9) or partial (n = 4) hematologic response, but only 1 had a cytogenetic partial response (Ph reduction from 100% to 10%) and 1 had a minor response (Ph reduction from 100% to 50%). Among 34 patients treated for cytogenetic resistance or relapse, 19 (56%) achieved a complete (n = 6) or partial (n = 7) cytogenetic response.

The gene is aberrantly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carrying 3q26 abnormalities. Two mRNAs are transcribed from this locus: EVI1 and a fusion of EVI1 with MDS1 (MDS1-EVI1), a gene located 5' of EVI1. The purpose of this study was to investigate which of the 2 gene products is involved in transformation in human AML. To discriminate between EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 transcripts, distinct real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed. Patients with 3q26 abnormalities often showed high EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 expression. In a cohort of 319 AML patients, 4 subgroups could be distinguished: EVI1(+) and MDS1-EVI1(-) (6 patients; group I), EVI1(+) and MDS1-EVI1(+) (26 patients; group II), EVI1(-) and MDS1-EVI1(+) (12 patients; group III), and EVI1(-) and MDS1-EVI1(-) (275 patients; group IV). The only 4 patients with a 3q26 aberration belonged to groups I and II. Interestingly, high EVI1 and not MDS1-EVI1 expression was associated with unfavorable karyotypes (eg, -7/7q-) or complex karyotypes. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between EVI1 expression and 11q23 aberrations (mixed lineage leukemia [MLL] gene involvement). Patients from groups I and II had significantly shorter overall and event-free survival than patients in groups III and IV. Our data demonstrate that high EVI1 expression is an independent poor prognostic marker within the intermediate- risk karyotypic group.","['Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani, Sahar', 'Erpelinck, Claudia', 'van Putten, Wim L J', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'van der Poel-van de Luytgaarde, Sonja', 'Hack, Ronald', 'Slater, Rosalyn', 'Smit, Elisabeth M E', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'de Greef, Georgine E', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani S', 'Erpelinck C', 'van Putten WL', 'Valk PJ', 'van der Poel-van de Luytgaarde S', 'Hack R', 'Slater R', 'Smit EM', 'Beverloo HB', 'Verhoef G', 'Verdonck LF', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Sonneveld P', 'de Greef GE', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*mortality/therapy', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1459 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57007-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Feb 1;101(3):837-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1459.

We studied the correlation of these three measures with each other and with response classification categories. In a clinical trial to test rIFN(-) versus rIFN(-) +Ara-C (N = 65 patients), we defined for each cytogenetic and FISH parameter, the patient's ""best response"" over time and at any given time. The strength and nature of agreement among the three measurements were determined by regression, correlation, and kappa statistic. Correlations between cyBM versus D-FISH-BM, cyBM versus D-FISH-PB and D-FISH-BM vs. D-FISH-PB were fairly strong. Regression showed cyBM values were significantly higher than those of D-FISH-PB or D-FISH-BM. No difference between D-FISH-PB and D-FISH-BM was apparent. When numerical responses (BR%) were classified into response categories (CR, PR, MR, NR), levels of agreement were weak to moderate. We observed a trend toward disagreement between cyBM and each D-FISH method, with cyBM tending to ""downgrade"" response category. Whether analyzed using actual numerical values or classified into response categories, cyBM differed from D-FISH-BM or D-FISH-PB.

However, the effects of LIF in cardiac fibroblasts are not known. Given that the cardiac fibroblast is the most abundant cell type in the heart, we sought to examine the functional effects of LIF on cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. RESULTS: Short-term LIF stimulation (24h) had no effect on fibroblast proliferation and/or cell differentiation. However, longer-term LIF stimulation (48-72h) increased fibroblast proliferation, and significantly inhibited cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. Moreover, 72h of LIF stimulation significantly reduced collagen content in cardiac fibroblasts cultures, as well as decreased MMP activity in fibroblast culture supernatants. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that LIF stimulation down-regulates several key components of the remodeling process, including collagen content and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and thus suggest that LIF may play an important autocrine/paracrine role in preventing excessive extracellular matrix remodeling following acute myocardial injury.","['Wang, Feng', 'Trial, JoAnn', 'Diwan, Abhinav', 'Gao, Feng', 'Birdsall, Holly', 'Entman, Mark', 'Hornsby, Peter', 'Sivasubramaniam, Natarajan', 'Mann, Douglas']","['Wang F', 'Trial J', 'Diwan A', 'Gao F', 'Birdsall H', 'Entman M', 'Hornsby P', 'Sivasubramaniam N', 'Mann D']","['Winters Center for Heart Failure Research, Baylor College of Medicine, 6565 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Smooth/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myocardium/*cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2002/10/24 04:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022282802920596 [pii]', '10.1006/jmcc.2002.2059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2002 Oct;34(10):1309-16. doi: 10.1006/jmcc.2002.2059.,,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",,['J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2002 Oct;34(10):1273-8.

Furthermore, the application of synthetic, short-chain ceramides mimics the cellular responses to these extracellular agents. However, the significance of ROS involvement in ceramide signaling pathways is poorly understood. Here we describe that the cellular responses to C2-/C6-ceramide of growth arrest in U937 monocytes and apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells are preceded by a rise in mitochondrial peroxide production. In Jurkat T-cells, this is associated with a large time- and dose-dependent loss of cellular glutathione. However, in U937 monocytes, glutathione loss is transient. Differences in the magnitude and kinetics of this alteration in cellular redox state associate with discrete outcomes, namely growth arrest or apoptosis.","['Phillips, Darren Charles', 'Allen, Kirsty', 'Griffiths, Helen R']","['Phillips DC', 'Allen K', 'Griffiths HR']","['Pharmacology Research Group, Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",2002/10/24 04:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/10/24 04:00'],"['2002/10/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0003986102004964 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-9861(02)00496-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2002 Nov 1;407(1):15-24. doi: 10.1016/s0003-9861(02)00496-4.,,,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that Hb-induced synthesis of VEGF in TF-bearing malignant cells is mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and by MAP-kinase pathways.","['Siddiqui, Farooq A', 'Desai, Hina', 'Siddiqui, Tazeen F', 'Francis, John L']","['Siddiqui FA', 'Desai H', 'Siddiqui TF', 'Francis JL']","['Center for Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Clinical and Research Laboratories, Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida, USA. farooq.siddiqui@flhosp.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Endothelial Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/isolation & purification', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thromboplastin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/10/23 04:00,2003/10/02 05:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2002/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200190 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(5):264-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200190.,,,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) into treatment protocols has improved the outcome of APL dramatically. Therefore, it is essential to establish the diagnosis of APL as quickly and as reliably as possible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 1714 newly diagnosed AML. In 92 cases an AML M3 (n=67) or M3v (n=25) was diagnosed using cytomorphology. In all these cases chromosome banding analysis and molecular studies were performed. RESULTS: In 3/92 APL cases (3.2%) normal chromosomes 15 and 17 in chromosome banding analysis were observed. In these cases either an insertion of parts of the PML-gene into the RARalpha-locus or an insertion of parts of the RARalpha-gene into the PML-locus was detected by FISH analysis. In all three patients a PML-RARalpha-rearrangement was also observed by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: A small subgroup of APL shows cryptic rearrangements of the PML- and RARalpha-gene that are undetectable by cytogenetics. This is analogous to Ph-negative, BCR-ABL-positive CML cases. FISH and RT-PCR have to be performed in all cases that show the typical characteristics of AML M3 or M3v in cytomorphology in addition to chromosome banding analysis.","['Schoch, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Loffler, Helmut', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schoch C', 'Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Lengfelder E', 'Loffler H', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. claudia.schoch@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/10/23 04:00,2003/10/02 05:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2002/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200181 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(5):259-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200181.,,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a long-term study.,251-8,"INTRODUCTION: The classification and the clinical management of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) that co-express myeloid antigens (MyALL) remain controversial because of the confusion of terms and criteria to define these cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The characteristics of 112 adult ALL patients were reviewed. The scoring systems proposed by Catovsky and EGIL Group to classify MyALL were applied to qualify cases with score 0 (group I), 0.5-1.5 (group II) and 2 (group III). RESULTS: Forty-seven (42%) cases co-expressed MyAgs (group II: 29; group III: 18). A greater percentage of MyALL cases belonged to the earlier B and T subclasses. Ph+ incidence, WBC count and expression of CD34, CD45RA and CD25 were higher in group III. All patients received intensive therapy: out of these, 93 (83%) achieved CR. Although the response did not correlate significantly with the co-expression of MyAgs, the patients with the highest score had the lowest CR rate: 72, 83 and 86% in groups III, II and I, respectively. Surprisingly, the DFS curve of group III proved to be the most favorable. However, the OS was not significantly different, even if a worse curve was observed in group II. Multivariate analysis showed that only score 2 significantly affected DFS. CONCLUSION: The scoring system accurately defines diagnosis and ontogeny of MyALL which appear to be related to incidence of Ph chromosome, elevated WBC count and elderly age. Consequently, fewer CR rates were documented in MyALL with the highest score. However, it was in this group that the good responders showed a greater capacity to continue in first remission.","['Cascavilla, Nicola', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Bodenizza, Carlo', ""Dell'Olio, Matteo"", 'Nobile, Michele', 'Minervini, Maria Marta', 'Perla, Gianni', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Carella, Angelo Michele']","['Cascavilla N', 'Musto P', 'Melillo L', 'Bodenizza C', ""Dell'Olio M"", 'Nobile M', 'Minervini MM', 'Perla G', ""D'Arena G"", 'Carella AM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, IRCCS - 71013, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. nicola54@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Myeloid Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2002/10/23 04:00,2003/10/02 05:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2001/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200186 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(5):251-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200186.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From November 1998 to May 2002 82 patients with advanced or progressive B-CLL received treatment with 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg for three consecutive days and CY at a dose of 650 mg/m(2) on day 1. The cycles were repeated at four week intervals or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. Guidelines for the evaluation of response and toxicity were those developed by the National Cancer Institute sponsored Working Group. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was detected by immunophenotyping only in patients with CR by standard criteria. In the analysed group an overall response (OR) rate (CR+PR) of 87.8% (95% CI 80.7-94.9%) was achieved, including complete response (CR) in 29.3% patients (95% CI 19.4-39.1%). Twenty-two of 24 patients with CR and 39 of 48 patients with PR are still in remission. Median duration of follow-up in these patients is 11.8 months (range 3-25.4). MRD was only detected in six out of 24 (25%) patients with CR. Grade III/IV thrombocytopenia was seen in four patients (4.9%) and neutropenia in 10 (12.2%). Severe infections were noted in 21 (25.6%) patients. Thirteen patients died, including seven with treatment related toxicity, one because of CLL progression and five because of reasons not related to CLL. In conclusion, the CC schedule is a highly active regimen in previously untreated B-CLL, with acceptable toxicity. The efficacy of the regimen seems to be higher than observed earlier after treatment with 2-CdA alone. A randomized clinical trial is in progress in our institutions.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Kasznicki, Marek', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz']","['Robak T', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kasznicki M', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Wolowiec D']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital.

The anthracendione mitoxantrone (MTN) in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) produces comparable complete remission rates to other regimens and may be less toxic. Over a 12 year period, 75 patients (median age 67 years, range 60-83 years) referred with newly diagnosed AML were treated with MTN and ara-C. MTN was administered at 12 mg/m(2)/day intravenously for three days in the first 26 patients, and 10 mg/m(2)/day intravenously for five days in a subsequent 49 patients. Ara-C was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) twice daily intravenously for seven days. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 34 out of 75 patients (45%). The median disease-free survival overall was 7.5 months (one month to nine and a half years). The median survival was one year for patients in whom CR was achieved, compared to four months in patients whom treatment failed (P=0.001).

This structural analogy prompted us to explore the binding of four indolocarbazole diglycosides with DNA and their capacity to interfere with the DNA cleavage-reunion reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase I. The molecular basis of the drug interaction with double-stranded DNA and with purified chromatin, with particular emphasis on the role of the carbohydrate moiety, was investigated by means of complementary spectroscopic techniques, including surface plasmon resonance and electric linear dichroism. We compared the DNA binding properties, sequence recognition, and effects on topoisomerase I-mediated DNA relaxation and cleavage of AT2433-A1 bearing a 2,4-dideoxy-4-methylamino-L-xylose residue, its dechlorinated analog AT2433-B1, the diastereoisomer iso-AT2433-B1 with an inverted aminosugar residue, and compounds 5H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione, 12-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-12,13-dihydro-6-methyl (JDC-108) and 5H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3, 4-c]carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione, 12-(6-O-alpha-D-galacto-pyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-12,13-dihydro-6-methyl (JDC-277) with an uncharged mono- and disaccharide, respectively. The two antibiotics AT2433-A1 and AT2433-B1 proved to be highly cytotoxic to leukemia cells and this may be a consequence of their tight intercalative binding to DNA, preferentially into GC-rich sequences as inferred from DNase I footprinting studies and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Like the diastereoisomer iso-AT2433-B1, they have no inhibitory effect on topoisomerase I, in contrast to the uncharged diglycoside JDC-277, which stimulates DNA cleavage by the enzyme mainly at TG sites, as observed with camptothecin. Cytotoxicity measurements with CEM and CEM/C2 human leukemia cell lines sensitive and resistant to camptothecin, respectively, also suggested that topoisomerase I contributes, at least partially, to the mechanism of action of the neutral diglycoside JDC-277 but not to that of the cationic AT2433 compounds. Together, the results indicate that sequence-selective DNA interaction and topoisomerase I inhibition is controlled to a large extent by the stereochemistry of the diglycoside moiety.","['Facompre, Michael', 'Carrasco, Carolina', 'Colson, Pierre', 'Houssier, Claude', 'Chisholm, John D', 'Van Vranken, David L', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Facompre M', 'Carrasco C', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Chisholm JD', 'Van Vranken DL', 'Bailly C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U-524 et Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Carbazoles', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Disaccharides/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/23 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.62.5.1215 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;62(5):1215-27. doi: 10.1124/mol.62.5.1215.,,,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '102622-96-8 (AT 2433-B1)', '102644-20-2 (AT 2433-A1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, experiments have examined whether other IL-6-related cytokines possess similar properties. Levels of oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor were analyzed in patients with overt bacterial peritonitis during the first 5 days of infection. Although no change in leukemia inhibitory factor was observed throughout the duration of infection, OSM was significantly elevated on day 1 and rapidly returned to baseline by days 2-3. The source of OSM was identified as the infiltrating neutrophils, and OSM levels correlated both with leukocyte numbers and i.p. soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) levels. FACS analysis revealed that OSM receptor beta expression was restricted to human peritoneal mesothelial cells. Stimulation of human peritoneal mesothelial cells with OSM induced phosphorylation of gp130 and OSM receptor beta, which was accompanied by activation of STAT3 and secretion of CC chemokine ligand 2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6. Although OSM itself did not modulate CXC chemokine ligand 8/IL-8 release, it effectively suppressed IL-1beta-mediated expression of this neutrophil-activating CXC chemokine. Moreover, OSM synergistically blocked IL-1beta-induced CXC chemokine ligand 8 secretion in combination with the IL-6/sIL-6R complex.

METHOD: Blood samples were obtained form patients with chronic renal insufficiency, leukemia or thalassemia and also from normal subjects. HLA-DR and -DQ genotyping of the sera from the 110 subjects was performed using micro-PCR-SSP and comparison was made with the results obtained from monoclonal antibody serologic typing. RESULT: Of the 110 samples detected by micro-PCR-SSP, 396 alleles of HLA-DR were identified in 99 cases and 22 of HLA-DQ in 11 cases, and 10% of the subjects were identified as homozygote individuals. Examination by both of the 2 methods in 67 cases indicated high rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses by serologic typing with the diagnostic discrepancy as high as 38.81% and 50.75% for HLA-DR and -DQ respectively. The antigens DR 15/16, 11/12, 13/14, 8 or 12; DQ 5/6, 8/9 were among those that frequently gave rise to errors or confusion.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) activates NFkappaB via a well-defined kinase pathways involving NFkappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), which activates downstream multisubunit IkappaB kinases (IKK). IKK in turn phosphorylates IkappaB, the central regulator of NFkappaB function. We found that intracellular vitamin C inhibits TNFalpha-induced activation of NFkappaB in human cell lines (HeLa, monocytic U937, myeloid leukemia HL-60, and breast MCF7) and primary endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant, and most cells accumulate ascorbic acid (AA) intracellularly by transporting the oxidized form of the vitamin, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Because ascorbic acid is a strong pro-oxidant in the presence of transition metals in vitro, we loaded cells with vitamin C by incubating them with DHA. Vitamin C-loaded cells showed significantly decreased TNFalpha-induced nuclear translocation of NFkappaB, NFkappaB-dependent reporter transcription, and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. Our data point to a mechanism of vitamin C suppression of NFkappaB activation by inhibiting TNFalpha-induced activation of NIK and IKKbeta kinases independent of p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that intracellular vitamin C can influence inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes via inhibition of NFkappaB activation.","['Carcamo, Juan M', 'Pedraza, Alicia', 'Borquez-Ojeda, Oriana', 'Golde, David W']","['Carcamo JM', 'Pedraza A', 'Borquez-Ojeda O', 'Golde DW']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry and Department of Clinical Chemistry, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 451, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/10/23 04:00,2002/12/12 04:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']","['bi0263210 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0263210 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2002 Oct 29;41(43):12995-3002. doi: 10.1021/bi0263210.,,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,['CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Literature accessed through MEDLINE (January 1970-January 2002), abstracts from the 2001 annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology, imatinib product labeling, and additional studies or abstracts identified from the bibliographies of the reviewed literature were used to compile data. Key search terms were allogeneic bone marrow transplant and stem cell transplant, chronic myeloid leukemia, imatinib, interferon, Gleevec, leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, STI-571, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. FINDINGS: Imatinib is a distinctively characteristic drug targeted toward inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with CML who failed interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy and for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) expressing the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit. Imatinib produces positive short-term hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML; short-term positive objective responses have been shown for patients with GISTs. To our knowledge, there are no controlled trials demonstrating long-term safety, improvement in disease-related symptoms, or increased survival with imatinib. Serious adverse effects requiring dosage decreases and/or therapy termination are edema, hepatotoxicity, and hematologic toxicity. Imatinib also has been found to inhibit tyrosine kinases involved in the growth of other malignancies. The role of imatinib in tumors that express a tyrosine kinase is constantly evolving with new research results. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib therapy should be limited to patients whose tumor growth is related to a genetically defective tyrosine kinase. In cases of CML, imatinib should be further limited to patients who have tried and failed IFN-alpha therapy or who are not candidates for an allogeneic stem cell transplant.","['Pindolia, Vanita K', 'Zarowitz, Barbara J']","['Pindolia VK', 'Zarowitz BJ']","['Pharmacy Care Management, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Piperazines/economics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Stromal Cells']",2002/10/23 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2002/10/23 04:00'],"['2002/10/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.22.15.1249.33482 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2002 Oct;22(10):1249-65. doi: 10.1592/phco.22.15.1249.33482.,66,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients were started on chemotherapy consisting of ARA-C given as continuous infusion. Due to acute respiratory insufficiency, all patients were treated in the ICCU with ventilation support. Respiratory insufficiency was most likely due to pulmonary leukostasis since pulmonary infection or edema were excluded by X-ray in all patients. Therapeutic leukapheresis was therefore initiated and resulted in a dramatic improvement in one patient. Two patients died due to multiorganic failure despite effective leukocyte depletion (>40%) and maximum supportive care. At the onset of symptoms, two patients had markedly elevated serum lactate levels most likely due to microcirculatory failure. Both patients died because of deteriorating sequelae of pulmonary leukostasis, however, the patient with marginally elevated serum lactate levels survived. Leukapheresis is an established therapeutic approach in patients with hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis, which improves the prognosis of high-risk patients. In our opinion, patients presenting with asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis may benefit from early leukapheresis, particularly when increasing serum lactate levels indicate the early onset of microcirculatory failure.","['Stemmler, J', 'Wittmann, G W', 'Hacker, U', 'Heinemann, V']","['Stemmler J', 'Wittmann GW', 'Hacker U', 'Heinemann V']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Abtl.

FA cells are sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis of FA cells using somatic cell fusion has facilitated the identification of eight complementation groups, suggesting that FA is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Six genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANGF, FANCG) have been cloned so far. The majority of affected patients belong to FA group A. Of the 32 unrelated Israeli patients with FA that we studied, 6 carried the FANCC mutations and 15 the FANCA mutations. Among the Jewish patients, ethnic-related mutations were common. Recent cumulative evidence suggests that the FA proteins are repair proteins. FANCC, FANCA and FANCG bind and interact in a protein complex found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of normal cells. FANCD2 exists in two isoforms; the long active form, FANCD2-L, is absent from FA cells of all complementation groups. FANCD2 colocalizes with BRCA1 in nuclear foci, probably as part of a large genomic surveillance complex. Studies using FANCA and FANCC knockout mice suggest that bone marrow precursors express interferon-gamma hypersensitivity and show progressive apoptosis.

HPV is also suspected of playing a role in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease and multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVES: To study the age distribution and clinical presentation of patients hospitalized for human parvovirus B19 infection. METHOD: We reviewed the case records of all pediatric patients with serologic evidence of HPV infection who were admitted during a 20 month period to a major community hospital. RESULTS: Of 128 children tested for HPV, 48 had evidence of acute infection based on the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies; 8 patients who also had positive IgM for other viruses were excluded, thus 40 case records were studied. The mean age of the patients was 5.21 years, but 22 patients were under 4. The clinical presentations included 25 patients with fever, either recurrent or prolonged, accompanied in some by enlarged spleen, liver and lymph nodes, skin rash and arthropathy; the remaining patients were investigated for anemia, skin rash, joint complaints and hepatitis. In addition, HPV infection was documented in several well-defined clinical conditions, such as SLE, vasculitic skin lesions, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, pure red cell aplasia, and optic neuritis.

METHOD: Since research on retroviruses began there has been a tendency to blame these elements for a number of clinical entities, the most important of which include Aids, tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), fungoid mycosis, Sjogren's syndrome and T cell leukaemia. Yet many patients and scientific publications point out the existence of a large number of clinical and laboratory inconsistencies, which suggests that the so called cofactors associated with all these entities are far more likely to be the real generators of these public health problems. Among these, we pay special attention to environmental toxins, of which a prototypical example is the group of neuromycotoxins. There are several ways these can enter the organism of an individual exposed to them (through food, breathing and intravenously) or, worse still, they can be generated endogenously in immunosuppressed individuals. CONCLUSION: The possibility of some cofactors being the real causes behind a large number of entities considered to be Aids, TSP, Sjogren s syndrome, fungoid mycosis or T cell leukaemia, among others, regardless of their retroviral serological state, is becoming more and more likely and scientifically plausible. All these facts should be researched in much greater depth to determine their real dimensions, which would therefore enable us to face the future with better means of prevention, diagnosis and treatment at our disposal.","['Leon-Sarmiento, F E', 'Carpintero de Jimeno, M']","['Leon-Sarmiento FE', 'Carpintero de Jimeno M']","['Unidad de Neurologia y Neurociencias Aplicadas, Departamento de Medicina Interna y Ciencias Basicas, Facultad de Salud, UIS-Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia. leonf@ninds.nih.gov']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,IM,"['HIV Infections/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/virology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/virology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/virology""]",2002/10/22 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['rn2001490 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Neurol. 2002 Sep 16-30;35(6):562-71.,224,"Retrovirus, micotoxinas, inmunosupresion y neurodegeneracion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, this life saving procedure is limited to a subset of patients who are in good medical condition due to the increased risk of regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease that occur with increasing age and poor performance status. On the other hand, it became apparent that the curative potential of transplantation was not solely due to the conditioning regimen but also to the graft-versus-leukemia effect mediated by alloreactive donor T cells. These observations led to the development of new transplant strategies using less intensive preparative regimens that would allow donor cell engraftment without the toxicity of myeloablative conditioning as a method of exploiting a graft-versus-malignancy effect in patients ineligible for conventional marrow grafts. Although follow-up is relatively short, preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility of non-myeloablative transplants in patients with heterogeneous diseases and disease status who Current challenges include defining the optimal regimen to promote full donor engraftment and the malignancies susceptible to this approach.

Since a review of the literature shows that the CYP2E1 knockout mouse is not known to possess any benzene toxicity, the metabolism of benzene by CYP2E1 in the liver is regarded to be prerequisite for its cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, although the mechanism is not fully understood yet. Because it was found some years ago that benzene was also a substrate for CYP1A1, we investigated the involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in benzene hematotoxicity using AhR wild-type (AhR(+/+)), heterozygous (AhR(+/-)), and homozygous (AhR(-/-)) male mice. Interestingly, following a 2-week inhalation of 300 ppm benzene (a potent dose for leukemogenicity), no hematotoxicity was induced in AhR(-/-) mice. Further, there were no changes in cellularity of peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM), nor in levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units in BM. This lack of hematotoxicity was associated with the lack of p21 overexpression, which was regularly seen in the wild-type mice following benzene inhalation. Combined treatment with two major benzene metabolites, phenol and hydroquinone, induced hemopoietic toxicity, although it was not known whether this happened due to a surprising lack of expression of CYP2E1 by AhR knockout, or due to a lack of other AhR-mediated CYP enzymes, including 1A1 (i.e., a possible alternative pathway of benzene metabolism). The former possibility, evaluated in the present study, failed to show a significant relationship between AhR and the expression of CYP2E1. Furthermore, a subsequent evaluation of AhR expression after benzene inhalation tended to show higher but less significant expression in the liver, and none in the BM, compared with sham control. Although this study failed to identify the more likely of the above-mentioned two possibilities, the study using AhR knockout mice on benzene inhalation presents the unique possibility that the benzene toxicity may be regulated by AhR signaling.","['Yoon, Byung-Il', 'Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Kawasaki, Yasushi', 'Kodama, Yukio', 'Kaneko, Toyozo', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Kim, Dae-Yong', 'Fujii-Kuriyama, Yoshiaki', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Yoon BI', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Kawasaki Y', 'Kodama Y', 'Kaneko T', 'Kanno J', 'Kim DY', 'Fujii-Kuriyama Y', 'Inoue T']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyohga, Setagayaku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hydroquinones/toxicity', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenol/toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/10/22 04:00,2003/05/09 05:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/toxsci/70.1.150 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2002 Nov;70(1):150-6. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/70.1.150.,,,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that expression of the JSRV env gene is sufficient to transform an avian embryo fibroblast cell line, DF-1. DF-1 cells transfected with an avian sarcoma-leukaemia retroviral expression vector containing the JSRV env gene [pRCASBP(A)-J:env] exhibited changes consistent with transformation, including contraction and rounding of cells with formation of dense foci. Transfection with a reporter construct expressing the green fluorescent protein did not induce morphological changes in DF-1 cells, eliminating the possibility that the vector, the transfection protocol or culturing techniques were responsible for the transformed phenotype. When pRCASBP(A)-J:env-transfected cells were inoculated into nude mice, tumours formed, verifying that the DF-1 cells were tumorigenic. Analysis of the JSRV env gene revealed a conserved tyrosine (597) and methionine (600) residue in the cytoplasmic tail within the transmembrane domain of the envelope, which creates a known binding site of SH2 domains in the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, when this tyrosine residue was mutated to serine or alanine, transformation was not affected. Furthermore, mutation of the methionine residue to valine or leucine also failed to eliminate JSRV env-mediated transformation. These results are in contrast to mutational analysis performed in JSRV env-transformed murine NIH-3T3 cells in which both the tyrosine and methionine residues are necessary for transformation. These findings suggest that more than one mechanism may be involved in JSRV env-mediated transformation.","['Allen, Thomas E', 'Sherrill, Kate J', 'Crispell, Sara M', 'Perrott, Matthew R', 'Carlson, Jonathan O', 'DeMartini, James C']","['Allen TE', 'Sherrill KJ', 'Crispell SM', 'Perrott MR', 'Carlson JO', 'DeMartini JC']","['Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology1 and Microbiology2, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Genes, env/*physiology', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Pulmonary Adenomatosis, Ovine/virology', 'Transfection', '*Transformation, Genetic', 'src Homology Domains']",2002/10/22 04:00,2002/12/21 04:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-83-11-2733 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2002 Nov;83(Pt 11):2733-2742. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-83-11-2733.,,,,,,['CA 59116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-83-11-2733 [doi]

Interestingly, the majority of HIV-1 particles that bind to the cell surface are taken up by the host cell via endocytosis; however, this mode of internalization generally does not result in infection. Presumably, virus particles remain trapped in the endocytic pathway and are eventually degraded. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of cells with various pharmacological agents known to elevate the pH of endosomes and lysosomes allows HIV-1 to efficiently enter and infect the host cell. Pretreatment of cells with bafilomycin A1 results in up to a 50-fold increase in the infectivity of HIV-1(SF2). Similarly, pretreatment of target cells with amantadine, concanamycin A, concanamycin B, chloroquine, and ammonium chloride resulted in increases in HIV-1 infectivity ranging between 2- and 15-fold. Analysis of receptor and coreceptor expression, HIV-long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation, and transduction with amphotropic-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors suggests that the increase in infectivity is not artifactual. The increased infectivity under these conditions appears to be due to the ability of HIV-1 and MLV particles to enter via the endocytic pathway when spared from degradation in the late endosomes and lysosomes. These results could have significant implications for the administration of current and future lysosmotropic agents to patients with HIV disease.","['Fredericksen, Brenda L', 'Wei, Bangdong L', 'Yao, Jian', 'Luo, Tianci', 'Garcia, J Victor']","['Fredericksen BL', 'Wei BL', 'Yao J', 'Luo T', 'Garcia JV']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amantadine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Endosomes/*metabolism/virology', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/drug effects/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism/virology', '*Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/10/22 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.22.11440-11446.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Nov;76(22):11440-6. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.22.11440-11446.2002.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Macrolides)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '88899-55-2 (bafilomycin A1)', 'BF4C9Z1J53 (Amantadine)']",,,"['R01 AI033331/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-33331/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC136743,,,,,,,,,,,

Gag normally selects the genomic RNA of the virus with high specificity; the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag plays a crucial role in this selection process. However, encapsidation of the viral RNA is completely unnecessary for particle assembly. We previously showed that mutant murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles that lack viral RNA because of a deletion in the cis-acting packaging signal (""Psi"") in the genomic RNA compensate for the loss of the viral RNA by incorporating cellular mRNA. The RNA in wild-type and Psi- particles was also found to be necessary for virion core structure. In the present work, we explored the role of RNA in MuLV particles that lack genomic RNA because of mutations in the NC domain of Gag. Using a fluorescent dye assay, we observed that NC mutant particles contain the same amount of RNA that wild-type virions do. Surprisingly enough, these particles contained large amounts of rRNAs. Furthermore, ribosomal proteins were detected by immunoblotting, and ribosomes were observed inside the particles by electron microscopy. The biological significance of the presence of ribosomes in NC mutant particles lacking genomic RNA is discussed.","['Muriaux, Delphine', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Harvin, Demetria', 'Rein, Alan']","['Muriaux D', 'Mirro J', 'Nagashima K', 'Harvin D', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, and Image Analysis Laboratory.

In this study we used the Friend virus model system to demonstrate that enhancement of the immune system can also have dramatic therapeutic effects. Since resistance to Friend virus-induced leukemia in mice is associated with T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immune responses, we enhanced these responses in susceptible mice by treatment with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG-ODN). Treatments begun at 4 days postinfection increased recovery from 6% in the control group to 74% in the CpG-treated group. CpG-mediated recovery was associated with a significant reduction of viral loads in the blood and spleens of treated mice compared to those of control animals. The treatment promoted Th1-type cytokine production by splenocytes of Friend virus-infected mice and augmented Friend virus-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses, but no influence on the virus-specific neutralizing antibody response was observed. Friend virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were critical for effective treatment with CpG-ODN, since in vivo depletion of these cells from treated mice prevented their recovery.

As(2)O(3) is believed to function primarily by promoting apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this report, using cDNA arrays, we have examined the changes in gene expression profiles triggered by clinically achievable doses of As(2)O(3) in acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells. CASPASE-10 expression was found to be potently induced by As(2)O(3). Accordingly, caspase-10 activity also substantially increased in response to As(2)O(3) treatment. A selective inhibitor of caspase-10, Z-AEVD-FMK, effectively blocked caspase-3 activation and significantly attenuated As(2)O(3)-triggered apoptosis. Interestingly, the treatment of NB4 cells with As(2)O(3) markedly increased histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10, an event that is associated with acetylation of the lysine 14 residue. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that As(2)O(3) potently enhances histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 locus. These results suggest that the effect of As(2)O(3) on histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 gene may play an important role in the induction of apoptosis and thus contribute to its therapeutic effects on acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Li, Ji', 'Chen, Peili', 'Sinogeeva, Natasha', 'Gorospe, Myriam', 'Wersto, Robert P', 'Chrest, Francis J', 'Barnes, Janice', 'Liu, Yusen']","['Li J', 'Chen P', 'Sinogeeva N', 'Gorospe M', 'Wersto RP', 'Chrest FJ', 'Barnes J', 'Liu Y']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, NIA Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 10', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/22 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207836200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32921-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Dec 20;277(51):49504-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207836200.

We have shown that neurite-mast cell communication can occur via substance P interacting with neurokinin (NK)-1 receptors on the mucosal mast cell-like cell, the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell. Neurite (murine superior cervical ganglia) and RBL cell [expressing the granule-associated antigen CD63-green fluorescent protein (GFP) conjugate] cocultures were established and stimulated with bradykinin (BK; 10 nM) or scorpion venom (SV; 10 pg/ml), both of which activate only neurites. Cell activation was assessed by confocal imaging of Ca2+ (cells preloaded with fluo 3), and analyses of RBL CD63-GFP+ granule movement were conducted. Neurite activation by BK or SV was followed by RBL Ca2+ mobilization, which was inhibited by an NK-1 receptor antagonist (NK-1 RA). Moreover, membrane ruffling was observed on RBL pseudopodial extensions in contact with the activated neurite, but not on noncontacting pseudopodia. RBL membrane ruffling was inhibited by NK-1 RA, but not NK-2 RA, and was accompanied by a significant increase in granule movement (0.13 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.01 microm/s) that was most evident at the point of neurite contact: many of the granules moved toward the plasmalemma. This is the first documentation of such precise (restricted to the membrane's contact site) transfer of information between nerves and mast cells that could allow for very subtle in vivo communication between these two cell types.","['Mori, N', 'Suzuki, R', 'Furuno, T', 'McKay, D M', 'Wada, M', 'Teshima, R', 'Bienenstock, J', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Mori N', 'Suzuki R', 'Furuno T', 'McKay DM', 'Wada M', 'Teshima R', 'Bienenstock J', 'Nakanishi M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya 467, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Little is known about the risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP. OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of 956 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed childhood ALL who were treated at a pediatric cancer center between February 1984 and July 1998. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent a diagnostic LP followed by a median of 4 LPs to instill intrathecal chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Traumatic LP was defined as an LP in which cerebrospinal fluid contained at least 10 red blood cells (RBCs) per microliter and bloody LP as one in which the cerebrospinal fluid contained at least 500 RBCs per microliter. RESULTS: Of the 5609 LPs evaluated, 1643 (29%) were traumatic and 581 (10%) were bloody. The estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for traumatic LP were 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) for black vs white race, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7-3.0) for age younger than 1 year vs 1 year or older, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for early vs recent (dedicated procedure area and general anesthesia) treatment era, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) for platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/ microL or more vs less than 100 x 10(3 )/ microL, 10.8 (95% CI, 7.7-15.2) for short (1 day) vs longer (>15 days) interval since the previous LP, and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) for the least vs the most experienced practitioners. Analyses for bloody LP yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The unmodifiable risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP include black race, age younger than 1 year, a traumatic or bloody previous LP performed within the past 2 weeks, and a previous LP performed when the platelet count was 50 x 10(3)/ microL or less. Modifiable risk factors include procedural factors reflected in treatment era, platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/ microL or less, an interval of 15 days or less between LPs, and a less experienced practitioner.","['Howard, Scott C', 'Gajjar, Amar J', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Kritchevsky, Stephen B', 'Somes, Grant W', 'Harrison, Patricia L', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'de Armendi, Alberto J', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Howard SC', 'Gajjar AJ', 'Cheng C', 'Kritchevsky SB', 'Somes GW', 'Harrison PL', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rivera GK', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'de Armendi AJ', 'Razzouk BI', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. scott.howard@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['African Americans', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Competence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', '*Spinal Puncture/adverse effects/methods', 'Whites']",2002/10/22 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/22 04:00'],"['2002/10/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['joc11632 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.288.16.2001 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2002 Oct 23-30;288(16):2001-7. doi: 10.1001/jama.288.16.2001.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['JAMA. 2003 Feb 5;289(5):548; author reply 549.

An important loss of viability induced by SnCl2 in a dose-response manner was observed in cells treated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). This necrotic cell death was further confirmed by flow cytometry. On the other hand, there was no loss of viability when cells were treated in rich medium (RPMI). DNA damage was visualized in SnCl2-treated K562 cells in both tested conditions. The data indicate that SnCl2 induces DNA damage and reduces K562 viability.

LCH is a clonal proliferative disorder of histiocytes that resembles in morphology and phenotype the dendritic antigen-presenting Langerhans' cells of the skin and other organs. Despite gaps in understanding, significant improvements in the therapies for this disease have been made. Careful risk stratification is critical for the appropriate administration of therapy.

The use of recombinant single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments has the potential to address these and other issues while allowing the addition of different effector functions. To develop therapeutic strategies that recruit both humoral and cellular arms of the immune response, we have constructed chimeric proteins linking either the human IgG1 Fc domain or the extracellular domain of murine B7.1 to a scFv specific for the oncofetal glycoprotein, 5T4. This TAA is expressed by a wide variety of carcinomas and is associated with metastasis and poorer clinical outcome. We have engineered retroviral constructs that produce fusion proteins able to interact simultaneously with both 5T4-positive cells and with the receptor/ligands of the immune effector moieties. Genetic delivery through a murine leukemia virus vector to 5T4-positive tumor cells results in the secreted scFv fusion protein binding to the cell surface. Furthermore, the scFv-HIgG1 fusion protein is able to direct lysis of 5T4-expressing human tumor cell lines through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, indicating its potential as a gene therapy for human cancers.","['Myers, Kevin A', 'Ryan, Matthew G', 'Stern, Peter L', 'Shaw, David M', 'Embleton, M Jim', 'Kingsman, Susan M', 'Carroll, Miles W']","['Myers KA', 'Ryan MG', 'Stern PL', 'Shaw DM', 'Embleton MJ', 'Kingsman SM', 'Carroll MW']","['Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd., Medawar Centre, Oxford Science Park, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Kidney', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/19 04:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700513 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2002 Nov;9(11):884-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700513.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to members of the family of cyclin T (T1, T2a and T2b) and to cyclin K. The Cdk9/cyclin T complex appears to be involved in regulating several physiological processes. In fact Cdk9 is the kinase of the P-TEFb complex, involved in basal transcription. Cdk9 has also been described as the kinase of the TAK complex, homologous to P-TEFb and involved in HIV replication. Here we show that Cdk9 interacts with gp130, the receptor of the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, which includes Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF), Interleukin-11 (IL-11) and Cardiotrophin (CT-1). IL-6 is a key regulator of hematopoiesis, immunological responses and inflammation. In addition, IL-6 plays a major role in the endocrine and nervous systems. Signal transduction by gp130 is mediated by physical interaction of the cytoplasmic region of gp130 with cellular kinases and results in the transcriptional activation of cellular and viral genes. We found that Cdk9 interacts in vitro with the cytoplasmic region of gp130 and we succeded in reproducing this interaction in vivo. Cdk9 expression was found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. The binding occurring between Cdk9 and gp130 increased upon IL-6 stimulation. We also observed that Cdk9 synergized with IL-6 in inducing the activation of an IL-6-responsive reporter plasmid. In summary, these results point to a previously undisclosed role for Cdk9 in signal transduction.","['Falco, Giulia De', 'Neri, Luca Maria', 'Falco, Maria De', 'Bellan, Cristiana', 'Yu, Zailin', 'Luca, Antonio De', 'Leoncini, Lorenzo', 'Giordano, Antonio']","['Falco GD', 'Neri LM', 'Falco MD', 'Bellan C', 'Yu Z', 'Luca AD', 'Leoncini L', 'Giordano A']","['Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Medicine, College of Science & Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, PA 19122, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2002/10/19 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205967 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 24;21(49):7464-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205967.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During recent years, gene targeting and organ culture approaches have been used efficiently to resolve key molecules involved in this multistage process. Nephrons are induced by the tips of the branching ureteric bud that later forms the collecting duct network. The first signal in nephron induction is obviously maintaining the mesenchyme; the second enhances cell proliferation and brings together the set of cells that contribute to one single nephron. This stage is characterized by two types of condensations (first the cap stage and then pre-tubular condensation). The final step, epithelial transformation, is a cell-autonomous process. Although the molecular cascade in nephron induction is being resolved in the rat, the same signals seem to work less efficiently in the mouse. In the rat, fibroblast growth factor-2 maintains the nephrogenic mesenchyme; leukaemia inhibitory factor together with transforming growth factor beta-2 induce its condensation; and autocrine secretion of Wnt-4 converts it to epithelium.","['Sariola, Hannu']",['Sariola H'],"['Institute of Biomedicine, Developmental Biology, University of Helsinki, FIN-00014, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Nephrons/*embryology', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2']",2002/10/19 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ndt/17.suppl_9.88 [doi]'],ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2002;17 Suppl 9:88-90. doi: 10.1093/ndt/17.suppl_9.88.,20,,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (TGFB2 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta2)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biochemical studies indicate that Tax, together with cellular transcription factors, interacts with viral cAMP-response element enhancer elements to recruit the pleiotropic coactivators CREB-binding protein and p300. Histone acetylation by these coactivators has been shown to play a major role in activating HTLV-I transcription from chromatin templates in vitro. However, the extent of histone modification and the precise identity of the cellular regulatory proteins bound at the HTLV-I promoter in vivo is not known. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to investigate factor binding and histone modification at the integrated HTLV-I provirus in infected T-cells (SLB-1). These studies reveal the presence of Tax, a variety of ATF/CREB and AP-1 family members (CREB, CREB-2, ATF-1, ATF-2, c-Fos, and c-Jun), and both p300 and CREB-binding protein at the HTLV-I promoter. Consistent with the binding of these coactivators, we observed histone H3 and H4 acetylation at three regions within the proviral genome. Histone deacetylases were also present at the viral promoter and, following their inhibition, we observe an increase in histone H4 acetylation on the HTLV-I promoter and a concomitant increase in viral RNA. Together, these results suggest that a variety of transcriptional activators, coactivators, and histone deacetylases participate in the regulation of HTLV-I transcription in infected T-cells.","['Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas J', 'Laybourn, Paul J', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Lemasson I', 'Polakowski NJ', 'Laybourn PJ', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', '*Genes, Viral', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/10/19 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M209566200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32915-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Dec 20;277(51):49459-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M209566200.

Indeed, both early ceramide generation and procaspase-8 cleavage have been individually identified as the initial apoptotic signaling events which precede the mitochondrial control of the apoptotic execution phase in Type II cells. In order to evaluate whether or not procaspase-8 cleavage is requisite for initial ceramide generation and rapid interphasic apoptosis, we investigated the chronological ordering of early ceramide generation and caspase-8 cleavage induced by daunorubicin (DNR) and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) in U937 cells. We further evaluated the impact of these two drugs on initial ceramide generation and apoptosis in wild-type Jurkat cells and Jurkat clones mutated for caspase-8 and Fas-associated death domain. We show that while both DNR and Ara-C similarly induced early ceramide generation (within 5-20 min) and interphasic apoptosis in all cell models, caspase-8 cleavage was only observed farther downstream (4.5 h) and only in DNR-treated cells. Furthermore, neither DNR or Ara-C induced caspase-8 activation. These results demonstrate that caspase-8 cleavage is not requisite for the drug-induced activation of the ceramide-mediated interphasic apoptotic pathway in human Type II leukemic cells.","['Terrisse, Anne-Dominique', 'Bezombes, Christine', 'Lerouge, Sandra', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Jaffrezou, Jean-Pierre']","['Terrisse AD', 'Bezombes C', 'Lerouge S', 'Laurent G', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, 20 rue Pont St Pierre, 31052 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*analysis/genetics', 'Ceramides/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Mutation', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/19 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1388198102002974 [pii]', '10.1016/s1388-1981(02)00297-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Oct 10;1584(2-3):99-103. doi: 10.1016/s1388-1981(02)00297-4.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ras has been speculated to be an initiating gene for haematological malignancy, but more investigation will be needed to determine the genes associated with the progression of the disease. 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat leukemia provides a good tool for research into various stages of the disease. The entire coding regions of p53 and ras genes were examined for mutations in the present study. In this experiment, we used fluorescence-labeled polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing to detect mutations of both genes on rat erythroleukemia. Fifteen out of 18 (83.3%) rat leukemias were found to have N-ras codon 61 mutation, consistent with previous results. The result of direct sequencing showed a single base substitution (CAA to CTA), resulting in an amino-acid change from Gln to Leu. No mutations were found in H-ras, K-ras or codon 12 of N-ras. The incidence of p53 gene mutation was 16.6% (3/18) in rat leukemia at late-stage. In the present study, mutation of the p53 gene was detected in three DMBA-induced leukemias as follows: a single-base substitution (CAT to CGT) at codon 177 (exon 5), resulting in an amino-acid change from Arg to Leu, a CGG to CTG/CGG changed at codon 211 (exon 6) resulting in an amino-acid change from His to Arg/His, and a GGG to TGG at codon 242 (exon 6) resulting in an amino-acid change from Gly to Trp, respectively. Thus, mutations of p53 gene do not seem to respond to the carcinogenesis of the DMBA-induced leukemia, in contrast to mutation of the N-ras oncogene, and may possibly be involved in the progress of multi-stage leukemogenesis.","['Wei, S', 'Kito, K', 'Miyoshi, A', 'Matsumoto, S', 'Kauzi, A', 'Aramoto, T', 'Abe, Y', 'Ueda, N']","['Wei S', 'Kito K', 'Miyoshi A', 'Matsumoto S', 'Kauzi A', 'Aramoto T', 'Abe Y', 'Ueda N']","['First Dept. of Pathology, Ehime University School of Medicine, Osen-gun, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans']",2002/10/19 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Sep;21(3):389-96.,,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is almost exclusively found in patients living in retrovirus HTLV-1 endemic areas. VIROLOGY: In ATL, monoclonal HTLV-1 provirus is integrated into atypical lymphocytes, called clover-leaf lymphocytes. The pathogenic mechanism leading to HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis remains obscure. The disease generally occurs after a long latency period. FOUR CLINICAL SUBTYPES: The diversity of the clinical presentation has led to the classification of ATL into four subtypes: acute or prototype, lymphoma, chronic, and painless. In the acute form of ATL there is a tumor syndrome associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia and a high rate of opportunistic infections due to the immunodepression predominated by cellular immunity. CLINICAL COURSE: Prognosis is poor for the acute and lymphomatous forms with a median survival of 6 and 10 months respectively. Infectious episodes are frequent, often caused by Pneumocystis carinii, and require systematic prophylaxis. Screening for anguilulosis and prophylaxis is also necessary.","['Besson, C', 'Plumelle, Y', 'Arnulf, B', 'Gonin, C', 'Panelatti, G', 'Bazarbachi, A', 'Hermine, O']","['Besson C', 'Plumelle Y', 'Arnulf B', 'Gonin C', 'Panelatti G', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Hermine O']","[""Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Necker, 149, rue de Sevres, F75743 Paris.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*pathology/virology', 'Pain/etiology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/10/19 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 2001 Feb 10;30(5):239-42.,,Leucemie/lymphome T de l'adulte.

The vWF anomaly was symptomatic in 4 of 6 patients at diagnosis. Patients were given symptomatic treatment with vWF replacement therapy as needed and specific treatment for their lymphoproliferative syndrome. Administration of DDAVP was sufficient in 3 out of 4 patients to allow invasive procedures but was unable to control digestive ulcer bleeding that required infusion of factor VIII-vWF concentrate. For 2 patients, chemotherapy was initiated due to threatening massive hemorrhage. The result was spectacular. The 4 other patients have been asymptomatic without treatment for 3, 5, 6 and 11 years during which time their lymphoproliferative syndrome has been quiescent. CONCLUSION: The clinical features and laboratory findings are similar in patients with congenital or acquired von Willebrand disease, but specific and etiologic chemotherapy is indicated for patients with acquired disease.","['Hunault-Berger, M', 'Rachieru, P', 'Ternisien, C', 'Jardel, H', 'Zandecki, M', 'Boasson, M', 'Ifrah, N']","['Hunault-Berger M', 'Rachieru P', 'Ternisien C', 'Jardel H', 'Zandecki M', 'Boasson M', 'Ifrah N']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU, 4, rue Larrey, F49033 Angers.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'von Willebrand Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'von Willebrand Factor/therapeutic use']",2002/10/19 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/19 04:00'],"['2002/10/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 2001 Feb 10;30(5):209-12.,,Maladie de Willebrand acquise et syndromes lymphoproliferatifs.,['0 (von Willebrand Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the role of LIF in LPS-induced thymic atrophy. LPS significantly elevated serum LIF within 1 h and induced thymic LIF mRNA within 6 h. Moreover, pretreatment of mice with anti-LIF antibody significantly reduced LPS-induced thymic atrophy. Using adrenalectomized mice and 17-day fetal thymic organ cultures treated with the steroidogenic enzyme inhibitor metyrapone, we demonstrated that LIF induced both systemic and intrathymic corticosteroid production.

Recently, TPA has been successfully administered to patients with myelocytic leukemia and has produced therapeutic effects that led to temporary remission. These studies demonstrated the potential efficacy of TPA in cancer chemotherapy. We now seek to understand the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of differentiation in response to TPA treatment in leukemia cells by expression profiling using DNA microarray. Our results show distinct temporal and coordinated gene changes that are consistent with differentiation and activation of multiple biochemical pathways in HL-60 cells exposed to TPA. Alterations of gene expression in HL-60 cells include various transcription factors, cytokines and protein markers that are consistent with the induction of differentiation elicited by TPA. These temporal patterns of gene expression were abolished or greatly diminished in an HL-60 derived TPA- resistant variant cell line (HL-525), thus revealing transcriptional and consequential biochemical changes that may be required for TPA-induced differentiation. In addition, certain genes were upregulated by TPA in TPA-resistant HL-525 cells but not in TPA-sensitive HL-60 cells suggesting that these genes may play a role in the resistant phenotype. These patterns of gene expression may be important for predicting response to TPA.","['Zheng, Xi', 'Ravatn, Roald', 'Lin, Yong', 'Shih, Wei-Chung', 'Rabson, Arnold', 'Strair, Roger', 'Huberman, Eliezer', 'Conney, Allan', 'Chin, Khew-Voon']","['Zheng X', 'Ravatn R', 'Lin Y', 'Shih WC', 'Rabson A', 'Strair R', 'Huberman E', 'Conney A', 'Chin KV']","['Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8020, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkf580 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Oct 15;30(20):4489-99. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkf580.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['R01 CA080826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC137144,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, beta-catenin is a key component in the canonical Wnt pathway. Aberrantly activated beta-catenin signaling contributes to cancer progression by inducing [in complex with lymphocyte enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF)] the transcription of proliferation-related genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. Plakoglobin can also activate LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. Excessive beta-catenin signaling in MEF triggers a p53-mediated antiproliferative response by inducing the expression of ARF. We have demonstrated previously that plakoglobin also exerts a tumor-suppressive effect in certain cancer cell lines. To identify genes induced by beta-catenin and plakoglobin, DNA microarray analysis was carried out, and PML was among those genes of which the expression was significantly elevated by both plakoglobin and beta-catenin. Activation of the PML promoter by beta-catenin and plakoglobin was LEF/TCF-independent. We found that PML forms a complex with beta-catenin in cells, and the two proteins colocalize in the nucleus. In addition, PML, p300, and beta-catenin cooperated in transactivation of a subset of beta-catenin-responsive genes including ARF and Siamois but not cyclin D1. Retroviral expression of beta-catenin, plakoglobin, or PML suppressed the tumorigenicity of p53-negative human renal carcinoma cells, thus pointing to a novel antioncogenic response triggered by catenins that is mediated by the induction of PML.","['Shtutman, Michael', 'Zhurinsky, Jacob', 'Oren, Moshe', 'Levina, Elina', ""Ben-Ze'ev, Avri""]","['Shtutman M', 'Zhurinsky J', 'Oren M', 'Levina E', ""Ben-Ze'ev A""]","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*physiology', 'Desmoplakins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'beta Catenin', 'gamma Catenin']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/11/30 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Oct 15;62(20):5947-54.,,,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Desmoplakins)', '0 (JUP protein, human)', '0 (Jup protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (gamma Catenin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As compared with their sensitive counterparts, Gleevec-resistant cell types were >/=5-fold resistant to Gleevec-induced apoptosis. Bcr-Abl protein levels were significantly increased in HL-60/Bcr-Abl R and K562 R (+Bcr-Abl) cells, but K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells showed a marked decline in the mRNA and protein levels and activity of Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl TK level and activity corresponded to the signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activity and up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 levels. The decline in Bcr-Abl expression and TK activity in K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells was associated with reduced AKT kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activities and increased sensitivity to the death ligand Apo-2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced apoptosis.

Treatment with 17-AAG or PD180970 also induced apoptosis of CD34+ leukemic cells from three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis who had progressive leukemia while receiving Gleevec therapy. Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to overexpression or mutations in Bcr-Abl, resistance to Gleevec may also develop due to a loss of Bcr-Abl expression.

We focused on a novel benzylamide analogue of sulindac sulfone, CP461, which is in clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic agent. As previously reported for colon carcinoma cell lines, we found that CP461 induced a rise in cGMP levels and blocked cell proliferation in the CLL cell line WSU-CLL. Surprisingly, however, cell cycle analysis revealed that CP461 caused G(2)-M arrest with an EC(50) of 1.1 micro M. G(2)-M arrest was associated with phosphorylation of Bcl2 (but not BAD, Bax, or Bcl-XL): both of these end points were abrogated by treatment with a calcium chelator. Although CP461 induces p53 up-regulation, G(2)-M arrest and Bcl2 phosphorylation were independent of p53. Because microtubule-active drugs such as vincristine also induced G(2)-M arrest and Bcl2 phosphorylation in WSU-CLL, whereas the genotoxic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin did not, we examined the effect of CP461 on microtubules by indirect immunofluoresence microscopy. CP461 eliminated microtubules rapidly, with reduction detected within 30 min of drug treatment. CP461 also induced marked changes in cell shape. Neither sulindac sulfide (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) nor sulindac sulfone induced G(2)-M arrest, Bcl2 phosphorylation, microtubule disassembly, or cell shape changes. Treatment with 30 micro M CP461 induced greater than 50% apoptosis in 10 of 10 primary CLL leukemic cell samples, whereas the same drug concentration had only marginal effects (14% apoptosis) on whole mononuclear cells. Our work demonstrates that addition of a benzylamide moiety to sulindac compounds results in markedly altered pharmacological properties that may be of use in the therapy of lymphoid malignancies.","['Moon, Eun-Yi', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Moon EY', 'Lerner A']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/11/30 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Oct 15;62(20):5711-9.,,,"['0 ((5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(4-pyridyl)methylene-3-(N-benzyl)-indene)-acetamide', 'hydrochloride)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', 'K619IIG2R9 (sulindac sulfone)']",,,['CA79838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether IL-18 can maintain graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in this context. B6D2F1 mice received transplants of T-cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) and splenic T cells from either syngeneic (H2(b/d)) or allogeneic B6 (H2(b)) donors.

Initial studies demonstrated that IL-18 treatment did not affect the proliferative responses or the cytolytic effector functions of T cells after BMT. In subsequent experiments, animals also received host-type P815 mastocytoma cells at the time of BMT. All syngeneic BM transplant recipients died from leukemia by day 18. The allogeneic BM transplant recipients effectively rejected their leukemia regardless of treatment and IL-18 significantly reduced GVHD-related mortality. Examination of the cytotoxic mechanisms with perforin-deficient donor T cells demonstrated that perforin is critical for the GVL effect.

Our results show for the first time that in addition to known mutations in the JM and the catalytic domain, further activating length mutations exist in the FLT3 gene.","['Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bagrintseva, Ksenia', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne']","['Spiekermann K', 'Bagrintseva K', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schnittger S']","['Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, GSF, National Research Center for Environment and Health, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany. spiekermann@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0953 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51504-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3423-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0953.,,,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SU 5614)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown why they are predictive and whether this is related to drug resistance. We previously reported that Down syndrome (DS) AML was associated with favorable resistance profiles. Here, we successfully analyzed drug resistance and (cyto-) genetic abnormalities of 109 untreated childhood AML samples using the 4-day total cell-kill methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Patients were classified according to the genetic abnormalities in the leukemic cells: t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), t(9;11), other 11q23 translocations, abnormalities of chromosome 5/7, trisomy 8 alone, normal karyotype, single random, and multiple (defined as 2 or more) abnormalities. The DS AML samples were excluded from the subgroup analysis. Samples with chromosome 5/7 abnormalities were median 3.9-fold (P =.01) more resistant to cytarabine than other AML samples. The t(9;11) samples were more sensitive to cytarabine (median 2.9-fold, P =.002), etoposide (13.1-fold, P =.001), the anthracyclines (2.9- to 8.0-fold, P <.01), and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (10.0-fold, P =.002) than other AML samples. The trisomy 8 and t(15;17) groups were too small for meaningful analysis. All other genetic subgroups did not show specific resistance profiles. Overall, we found no differences in drug resistance in samples taken at diagnosis between patients remaining in continuous complete remission (CCR) versus the refractory/relapsed patients. Within several genetic subgroups, however, relapsed/refractory patients were more cytarabine resistant when compared with patients remaining in CCR, but numbers were small and the results were not significant. We conclude that some, but not all, cytogenetic subgroups in childhood AML display specific drug-resistance profiles.","['Zwaan, Christian M', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Huismans, Dieuwke R', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Slater, Rosalyn M', 'Creutzig, Ursala', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Zwaan CM', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Pieters R', 'Hahlen K', 'Huismans DR', 'Zimmermann M', 'Harbott J', 'Slater RM', 'Creutzig U', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. cm.zwaan@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V100.9.3352 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51494-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3352-60. doi: 10.1182/blood.V100.9.3352.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their microvessel areas and counts were significantly higher than those of patients with anemia due to iron or vitamin B(12) deficiencies. A cutoff value of 0.90 mm(2) x 10(-2) or greater of the microvessel area identified patients with earlier upstaging and shorter progression-free survival. When the cutoff was applied to the Rai subclassification, both Rai 0 and Rai I-II patients who upstaged and shortened the progression-free survival were classified correctly. Information of this type was not given by the microvessel counts. The cutoff did not correlate with other predictors representative of tumor mass or disease progression. The microvessel area correlated with the expression of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor tissue, and serum levels of VEGF were found to be of prognostic value.

However, little is known about its effects on hematopoietic malignancies. In this study, we show that 21 primary samples of acute leukemia were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of AN-9, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 45.8 +/- 4.1 microM. In colony-forming assays, primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells were 3-fold more sensitive to AN-9 than the normal hematopoietic progenitors, erythroid burst-forming units and granulocyte/monocyte colony-forming units. AN-9 induced apoptosis in the T-ALL cell line CEM. A common problem with cancer is chemoresistance, which is often typical of relapsed cancers. Remarkably, a T-ALL sample at diagnosis and an acute myeloid leukemia sample at relapse that were resistant to doxorubicin in vitro were sensitive to AN-9, with an IC(50) of 50 microM for both samples. More strikingly, samples from 2 infants with t(4;11) ALL obtained at diagnosis and relapse each were the most sensitive to AN-9, with IC(50) values of 25 microM and 17 microM, respectively. Furthermore, a doxorubicin-resistant clone of HL60, HL60/ADR, obtained by the transfection of the MDR-1 gene, was equally sensitive to AN-9 cytotoxicity as the parental cells. AN-9 induced the expression of p21 in an infant leukemia sample with 11q23 rearrangement, but not in T- or B-precursor ALL. Collectively, our results suggest that AN-9 is a selective agent for hematopoietic malignancies that can circumvent the mechanisms of chemoresistance limiting most conventional chemotherapy.","['Batova, Ayse', 'Shao, Li-en', 'Diccianni, Mitchell B', 'Yu, Alice L', 'Tanaka, Tetsuya', 'Rephaeli, Ada', 'Nudelman, Abraham', 'Yu, John']","['Batova A', 'Shao LE', 'Diccianni MB', 'Yu AL', 'Tanaka T', 'Rephaeli A', 'Nudelman A', 'Yu J']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Medical Center, University of California-San Diego, 200 West Arbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92103-8447, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, MDR', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0567 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51490-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3319-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0567.,,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '122110-53-6 (pivalyloxymethyl butyrate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,"['CA 79951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00827/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with SCN and cyclic neutropenia, a related disorder characterized by periodic oscillations in the number of circulating neutrophils, have heterozygous germline mutations in the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE). To test the hypothesis that these mutations are causative for SCN, we generated transgenic mice carrying a targeted mutation of their Ela2 gene (""V72M"") reproducing a mutation found in 2 unrelated patients with SCN, one of whom developed AML. Expression of mutant NE mRNA and enzymatically active protein was confirmed. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for the V72M allele have normal numbers of circulating neutrophils, and no accumulation of myeloid precursors in the bone marrow was observed. Serial blood analysis found no evidence of cycling in any of the major hematopoietic lineages. Rates of apoptosis following cytokine deprivation were similar in wild-type and mutant neutrophils, as were the frequency and cytokine responsiveness of myeloid progenitors. The stress granulopoiesis response, as measured by neutrophil recovery after cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression, was normal. To define the leukemogenic potential of V72M NE, a tumor watch was established. To date, no cases of leukemia have been detected.

These receptors are composed of unique alpha subunits that interact with common beta(c) subunits. A chimeric receptor (hGM/beta(c)), comprising the extracellular domain of the hGM-CSF receptor alpha subunit (hGM Ralpha) fused to the intracellular domain of hbeta(c), was generated to determine whether hbeta(c) activation is alone sufficient to promote differentiation. hGM-CSF activation of hGM/beta(c), expressed in the presence and absence of the hbeta(c) subunit, promoted maintenance of primitive phenotype. This indicates that the cytosolic domain of the hGM Ralpha chain is required for differentiation mediated by activation of the hGM Ralpha, beta(c) receptor complex. We have previously demonstrated that the alpha cytosolic domain confers signal specificity for IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Bioinformatic analysis of the IL-3 Ralpha and GM Ralpha subunits identified a tripeptide sequence, adjacent to the conserved proline-rich domain, which was potentially a key difference between them. Cross-exchange of the equivalent tripeptides between the alpha subunits altered receptor function compared to the wild-type receptors. Both the mutant and the corresponding wild-type receptors promoted survival and proliferation in the short-term but had distinct effects on developmental outcome.

Of the 257 patients evaluable for induction treatment, 131 were randomized to receive IDA alone (arm A) and 126 to receive IDA + Ara-C (arm B). Treatment in arm A consisted of 10 mg/m(2) IDA daily for 6 consecutive days, whereas in arm B it consisted of 12 mg/m(2) IDA daily for 4 days combined with 200 mg/m(2) Ara-C daily in continuous infusion for 7 days. Once in complete remission (CR), patients received 3 consolidation courses of standard chemotherapy, and those still in CR at the end of the consolidation were randomized to receive or not receive 1 mg/kg 6-mercaptopurine daily and intramuscular injections of 0.25 mg/kg methotrexate weekly for 2 years. Overall, 100 (76.3%) patients in arm A and 84 (66.6%) patients in arm B achieved CR (P = NS). Event-free survival (EFS) rates were 35% and 23% for patients in arm A and arm B, respectively (P =.0352). Multivariate analysis revealed that EFS was favorably influenced by induction treatment with IDA alone (P =.0352) and unfavorably influenced by white blood cell (WBC) counts greater than 3000/microL (P =.0001) and increasing age (P =.0251). These results indicate that anthracycline monochemotherapy with IDA favorably influences the EFS of patients with newly diagnosed hypergranular APL.","['Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Petti, Maria Concetta', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Vegna, Maria Luce', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Cantore, Nicola', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Gallo, Eugenio', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Liso, Vincenzo', 'Mariani, Guglielmo', 'Ricciuti, Francesco', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'Sica, Simona', 'Veneri, Dino', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Avvisati G', 'Petti MC', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Vegna ML', 'Amadori S', 'Baccarani M', 'Cantore N', 'Di Bona E', 'Ferrara F', 'Fioritoni G', 'Gallo E', 'Invernizzi R', 'Lazzarino M', 'Liso V', 'Mariani G', 'Ricciuti F', 'Selleri C', 'Sica S', 'Veneri D', 'Mandelli F']","['Hematology, Universita Campus-Bio-Medico, 83 Via Emilio Longoni, 00155 Rome, Italy. g.avvisati@unicampus.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0352 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51468-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3141-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0352.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,['Cancer Treat Rev. 2003 Apr;29(2):143-6.

We previously reported a higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) associated with allogeneic PBSC transplantation in a randomized trial. In this follow-up report, we analyzed the evolution of cGVHD in the patients (n = 101) enrolled on this study. At a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 31-57 months), we found that the 3-year cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51%-78%) in the PBSC group and 36% (95% CI 23%-49%) in the BM group (P =.004). We also found that extensive cGVHD was more frequent in the PBSC group (44% [95% CI 30%-58%] vs 17% [95% CI 7%-27%]; P =.004). The prevalence of cGVHD was always higher in the PBSC arm. Ocular involvement was more frequent in PBSC recipients (P =.02). Cutaneous and liver involvement was similar among BM and PBSC recipients. Chronic GVHD required multiple courses of immunosuppressive therapy in addition to cyclosporine and corticosteroids during longer periods (P =.03). Altogether, this translated into longer periods of hospitalization after transplantation in the PBSC group (P =.04). Finally, we also confirm that cGVHD after PBSC transplantation is associated with an antileukemic effect that is at least as potent as after BM. However, to date, this has not translated into a survival difference, possibly due to the early-stage leukemic status of these patients or to the relatively small size of the study population.","['Mohty, Mohamad', 'Kuentz, Mathieu', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Jouet, Jean-Pierre', 'Attal, Michel', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Blaise, Didier']","['Mohty M', 'Kuentz M', 'Michallet M', 'Bourhis JH', 'Milpied N', 'Sutton L', 'Jouet JP', 'Attal M', 'Bordigoni P', 'Cahn JY', 'Boiron JM', 'Blaise D']","['Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 232 Boulevard Sainte Marguerite, 132273 Marseille Cedex 09, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Eye/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Skin/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viscera/pathology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V100.9.3128 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51466-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3128-34. doi: 10.1182/blood.V100.9.3128.,,,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,['Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle et de Therapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC)'],,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for using R + F includes single-agent efficacy of both drugs, in vitro synergism of R and F, and no apparent overlapping toxicity. Of 31 eligible patients with B-CLL enrolled, 20 were previously untreated and 11 relapsed. Treatment consisted of fludarabine administered at standard doses (25 mg/m(2)/d; days 1-5, 29-33, 57-61, and 85-89) and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/d) given on days 57, 85, 113, and 151. Side effects such as fever, chills, and exanthema were generally mild (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [NCI-CTC] grade 1/2 in 48% and grade 3 and/or 4 in 3% of patients). Fever and chills were mainly associated with the first rituximab infusion. Hematologic toxicity included neutropenia (grade 1 and/or 2 in 26%, grade 3 and/or 4 in 42%) and thrombocytopenia (grade 1 and/or 2 in 19%, grade 3 and/or 4 in 9%). One patient died of cerebral bleeding during prolonged thrombocytopenia after the second cycle of fludarabine. There were a total of 32 infections in 16 patients, none of which was fatal. The overall response rate (complete remission [CR] and partial remission [PR]) was 87% (27 of 31 evaluable patients). In 20 previously untreated patients, 17 (85%) responded. Ten of 31 patients achieved CR (5 of 20 untreated; 5 of 11 pretreated; 9 of 21 Binet stage B, 1 of 10 Binet stage C). The median duration of response was 75 weeks.

Defects in CD79 can influence both BCR expression and signaling and may explain why cells from certain malignancies, such as B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), often express diminished and inactive BCR. Recently, an alternative transcript of CD79b (DeltaCD79b) has been reported that is up-regulated in B-CLL and may explain this diminished BCR expression. Here we assess the expression of DeltaCD79b in B-CLL and other lymphoid malignancies and investigate its function. High relative expression of DeltaCD79b was confirmed in most cases of B-CLL and found in 6 of 6 cases of splenic lymphomas with villous lymphocytes (SLVLs) and hairy cell leukemia. In a range of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, expression of DeltaCD79b was relatively low but correlated inversely with the ability of the BCR to signal apoptosis when cross-linked by antibody (Ab). Interestingly, when Ramos-EHRB cells, which express low DeltaCD79b, were transfected with this transcript, they were transformed from being sensitive to anti-Fcmu-induced apoptosis to being highly resistant. Although DeltaCD79b was expressed as protein, its overexpression did not reduce the level of cell surface BCR. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory activity of DeltaCD79b depended on an intact leader sequence to ensure endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trafficking and a functional signaling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic tail. These results point to DeltaCD79b being a powerful modulator of BCR signaling that may play an important role in normal and malignant B cells.","['Cragg, Mark S', 'Chan, H T Claude', 'Fox, Mathew D', 'Tutt, Alison', 'Smith, Aimee', 'Oscier, David G', 'Hamblin, Terry J', 'Glennie, Martin J']","['Cragg MS', 'Chan HT', 'Fox MD', 'Tutt A', 'Smith A', 'Oscier DG', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Glennie MJ']","['Tenovus Research Laboratory, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. msc@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Dimerization', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V100.9.3068 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51458-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Nov 1;100(9):3068-76. doi: 10.1182/blood.V100.9.3068.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This drug acts by selectively repressing the translation of proteins that are encoded by an mRNA bearing a 5'-polypyrimidine tract (e.g., ribosomal proteins, elongation factors). The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) carries a polypyrimidine motif that is located within the tat exon 2. Treatment of human T lymphoid cells with rapamycin resulted in a marked diminution of HIV-1 transcription when infection was performed with luciferase reporter T-tropic and macrophage-tropic viruses. Replication of fully infectious HIV-1 particles was abolished by rapamycin treatment. The rapamycin-mediated inhibitory effect on HIV-1 production was reversed by FK506. The anti-HIV-1 effect of rapamycin was also seen in primary human cells (i.e., peripheral blood lymphocytes) from different healthy donors. Rapamycin was shown to diminish basal HIV-1 long terminal repeat gene expression, and the observed effect of rapamycin on HIV-1 replication seems to be independent of the virus-specific transactivating Tat protein. A constitutive beta-actin promoter-based reporter gene vector was unaffected by rapamycin treatment. Kinetic virus infection studies and exposure to reporter viruses pseudotyped with heterologous envelope proteins (i.e., amphotropic murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus G) suggested that rapamycin is primarily affecting the life cycle of HIV-1 at a transcriptional level.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clonogenic, limiting dilution, and nuclear condensation assays were used to evaluate SOC antagonist efficacy. SOC activity and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content were measured by flow cytometry. Murine bone marrow transplantation was used to determine purging efficacy and effects on hemopoietic reconstitution. RESULTS: Econazole (Ec) and ketotifen (Ke) were variably effective against human and murine leukemia cell lines after 24 hours of incubation. However, a 2-hour serum and bovine serum albumin-free treatment protocol with Ec was found to maximize differential sensitivity between leukemic cells and normal hemopoietic progenitors. Primary acute myelogenous leukemia blast cell viability was reduced 4.2 to 5.1 logs by 2-hour Ec treatment as measured by limiting dilution. An inverse relationship between endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content and Ke sensitivity in leukemia and untransformed cells was observed. Nuclear condensation, an index of apoptosis, which occurred after 24-hour treatments with either Ec or Ke, was not observed after 2-hour serum- and bovine serum albumin-free Ec exposures; however, condensed nuclei were observed after an additional 10-hour incubation in growth medium without drug. Using bone marrow deliberately contaminated with 1% P815 cells, we showed that highly effective in vitro purging can be accomplished using Ec with no adverse effects on bone marrow reconstitution in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that SOC antagonists have potential as purging agents for residual leukemia cells present in bone marrow in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation for leukemia.","['Soboloff, Jonathan', 'Zhang, Yicheng', 'Minden, Mark', 'Berger, Stuart A']","['Soboloff J', 'Zhang Y', 'Minden M', 'Berger SA']","['AIDRC, University Health Network and the Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging/methods', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Econazole/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ketotifen/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'U937 Cells']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008937 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00893-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1219-26. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00893-7.,,,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '6Z1Y2V4A7M (Econazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X49220T18G (Ketotifen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with no need for post-PCR processing is an attractive approach for detection and quantification of specific DNA or RNA sequences. In the present study we evaluated a real-time PCR-based technology for MRD quantification in children with precursor-B ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 36 children with newly diagnosed precursor-B ALL were available for molecular analysis. All patients were uniformly treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) protocols from 1992. A real-time PCR assay was applied for MRD quantification using LightCycler technology and the SYBR green fluorescent dye for detection of clone-specific Ig and TCR gene rearrangements as target sequences. The specificity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-four of the 36 children with precursor-B ALL (94%) displayed at least one clonal Ig heavy chain (IgH) or TCR gene sequence useful as a molecular target. These clone-specific targets were successfully applied for real-time PCR quantification in all but one patient. Melting curve analysis was important for identifying all specific PCR products. In 32 pediatric precursor-B-ALL patients an MRD level >/=10(-3) at day 29 during induction treatment was significantly correlated with later bone marrow relapse (p = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR using clone-specific primers and the SYBR green dye for detection is a feasible technique for identifying patients at risk for relapse. This approach provides an easily applicable tool for detection of IgH/TCR gene rearrangements in the routine setting.

We sought to identify OCT genes preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We isolated a novel OCT, named OCT6, by data-mining human expressed sequence tag databases for sequences homologous to known OCT genes. We developed a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay to determine the relative expression of this gene in 50 cancer cell lines and in tissues. RESULTS: The two highest expressing cell lines were the leukemia cell lines HL-60 and MOLT4. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis using a normal tissue cDNA panel demonstrated that this transport gene is highly expressed in testis and fetal liver, with detectable RNA levels in bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes. Unlike other OCT genes, RNA levels were not detectable in placenta, liver, or kidney. To further define the expression of OCT6 in hematopoietic tissues, we measured OCT6 RNA levels in sorted peripheral blood cell populations and found a clear enrichment of OCT6-expressing cells in purified CD34(+) cells. To determine if OCT6 was highly expressed in leukemias, we examined circulating leukemia cells from 25 patients and found high levels of OCT6 RNA in all specimens in comparison with liver, kidney, and placenta. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the existence of a novel OCT preferentially expressed in human hematopoietic tissues, including CD34(+) cells and leukemia cells. Its narrow tissue distribution, potential for substrate specificity, and close homology to other cell membrane transporters make OCT6 an attractive target for the treatment of leukemia.","['Gong, Shimei', 'Lu, Xin', 'Xu, Yongsheng', 'Swiderski, Carol F', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A']","['Gong S', 'Lu X', 'Xu Y', 'Swiderski CF', 'Jordan CT', 'Moscow JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'DNA Primers', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009013 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00901-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1162-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00901-3.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC22A16 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is expressed in mammalian neurons and hematopoietic cells. In brain, it responds to stress by mRNA overexpression and alternative splicing, yielding the rare stress-associated ""readthrough"" AChE-R variant protein. This led us to explore the hematopoietic involvement of AChE-R and its cleavable C-terminal peptide ARP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AChE mRNA variants were labeled in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells by in situ hybridization. ARP expression was detected by multicolor flow cytometry. Bromo-deoxyuracil incorporation and viable cell counts served to evaluate the proliferative effects of ARP and suppressive effects of the AChE antisense oligonucleotide AS1 on CD34(+) cells. RESULTS: The distal enhancer, proximal promoter, and first intron of the human AChE gene include consensus binding sites for hematopoietically active and stress-induced transcription factors. CD34(+) cells from human cord blood were found to express all three variant AChE mRNAs, having different intracellular distributions. ARP was found in 5 to 15% of adult peripheral blood, bone marrow, and fetal CD34(+) cells (both committed CD38(+) and uncommitted CD38(-)) and in acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Externally supplied ARP by itself facilitated the proliferation of CD34(+) cells in an antisense suppressible manner. When combined with early-acting cytokines, ARP enhanced survival and expansion of CD34(+) cells up to 28 days in culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support ARP, the C-terminal peptide of AChE-R, as a new hematopoietic growth factor that may promote the myelopoietic expansion and thrombopoiesis characteristic of stress and may be used to enhance the efficiency of ex vivo expansion for bone marrow transplantation.","['Deutsch, Varda R', 'Pick, Marjorie', 'Perry, Chava', 'Grisaru, Dan', 'Hemo, Yoram', 'Golan-Hadari, Dita', 'Grant, Alastair', 'Eldor, Amiram', 'Soreq, Hermona']","['Deutsch VR', 'Pick M', 'Perry C', 'Grisaru D', 'Hemo Y', 'Golan-Hadari D', 'Grant A', 'Eldor A', 'Soreq H']","['Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. varda@tasmc.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fetus/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Variation', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Stress, Physiological/enzymology/*genetics']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009001 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00900-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1153-61. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00900-1.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, disrupting c-myb function might provide a strategy for controlling leukemic cell growth. Use of dominant negative mutants as a strategy for inhibiting oncogene function has attracted considerable attention. The aim of this study was to induce apoptosis in K562 cells by dominant negative c-myb (DN-myb). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a DN-myb plasmid containing the DNA-binding domain of c-myb and transfected the dominant negative mutant, like its wild-type (WT) counterpart, into K562 cells. Consequently, cell viability and induction of apoptosis were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and Western hybridization analysis for expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, the effect of DN-myb on bcl-2 promoter activity and expression of bcl-2 and bcr-abl was studied. RESULTS: We observed that DN-myb, cotransfected with WT c-myb and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the bcl-2 promoter, bound competitively to the bcl-2 promoter and significantly decreased the activation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase induced by WT c-myb. Moreover, the inactivation of transcription induced by DN-myb reduced not only the expression of bcl-2 but also the expression of bcr-abl. Further functional studies focused on the effect of DN-myb on the induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. Transfection of DN-myb into K562 cells caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation when cells were exposed to low concentrations of DNA-damaging agents (approximately 30% of control) and remarkably increased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that disruption of c-myb function by dominant negative c-myb is an effective strategy to induce apoptosis of leukemic cells. The results of these studies support the thesis that dominant negative c-myb gene therapy may be useful for treatment of leukemia patients.","['Yi, Ho Keun', 'Nam, Sang Yun', 'Kim, Jae Cheol', 'Kim, Jung Soo', 'Lee, Dae Yeol', 'Hwang, Pyoung Han']","['Yi HK', 'Nam SY', 'Kim JC', 'Kim JS', 'Lee DY', 'Hwang PH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, myb/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Transfection']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008962 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00896-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1139-46. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00896-2.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis. In the current study, we studied the dependence of CMML on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used in vitro colony assays in methylcellulose where CMML cells were tested in the presence or absence of the specific GM-CSF antagonist E21R. We also developed an in vivo model in which CMML cells were tested for their ability to engraft into immunodeficient mice transgenic for human GM-CSF. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells from seven of seven patients with CMML formed spontaneous colonies that were sensitive to E21R treatment, with reduction in colony growth by up to 92%. E21R also inhibited colony formation by CMML patient cells stimulated by exogenously added GM-CSF but not interleukin-3. In in vivo experiments we observed engraftment of CMML cells (but not normal cells) in immunodeficient mice transgenic for human GM-CSF. None engrafted in nontransgenic mice. Cell dose escalation showed that the optimal number was 0.5 to 1 x 10(8) peripheral blood mononuclear cells per mouse, which is equivalent to an infusion of 0.2 to 3.6 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells. Time course experiments showed that maximal engraftment occurred 6 weeks after injection. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that in some CMML patients, GM-CSF produced by either autocrine or paracrine mechanisms is a major growth determinant. The results suggest that therapies directed at blocking this cytokine could control the growth of some CMML patients in vivo.","['Ramshaw, Hayley S', 'Bardy, Peter G', 'Lee, Melissa A', 'Lopez, Angel F']","['Ramshaw HS', 'Bardy PG', 'Lee MA', 'Lopez AF']","['Cytokine Receptor Laboratory, Division of Human Immunology, IMVS, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/deficiency/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009037 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00903-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1124-31. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00903-7.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The well-known p21 Ras proteins H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras 4A, and K-Ras 4B are also frequently mutated in human cancer and leukemia. Besides the four p21 Ras proteins, the Ras subfamily of the Ras superfamily includes R-Ras, TC21 (R-Ras2), M-Ras (R-Ras3), Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, Rap2B, RalA, and RalB. They exhibit remarkable overall amino acid identities, especially in the regions interacting with the guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze their activation. In addition, there is considerable sharing of various downstream effectors through which they transmit signals and of GTPase activating proteins that downregulate their activity, resulting in overlap in their regulation and effector function. Relatively little is known about the physiological functions of individual Ras family members, although the presence of well-conserved orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that their individual roles are both specific and vital. The structural and functional similarities have meant that commonly used research tools fail to discriminate between the different family members, and functions previously attributed to one family member may be shared with other members of the Ras family. Here we discuss similarities and differences in activation, effector usage, and functions of different members of the Ras subfamily. We also review the possibility that the differential localization of Ras proteins in different parts of the cell membrane may govern their responses to activation of cell surface receptors.","['Ehrhardt, Annette', 'Ehrhardt, Gotz R A', 'Guo, Xuecui', 'Schrader, John W']","['Ehrhardt A', 'Ehrhardt GR', 'Guo X', 'Schrader JW']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/*physiology', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009049 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00904-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Oct;30(10):1089-106. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00904-9.,241,,"['0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and GLA may be due, in part, to induction of neutrophil apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EPA and GLA, alone or in combination, trigger apoptotic cell death in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line. HL-60 cells were incubated with 10, 20, 50, and 100 micromol/L EPA, GLA, or various combinations of EPA and GLA for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hs. Oleic acid (18:1 n-9) was used as a fatty acid control. Flow cytometry using dual staining with propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC assessed apoptosis, necrosis, and viability. Apoptosis was verified by DNA fragmentation as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. EPA, GLA, and various combinations of EPA and GLA significantly induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability in HL-60 cells. Viability was significantly reduced to the same extent with the combination of 50 micromol/L EPA\20 micromol/L GLA compared with 100 micromol/L EPA. These data indicate that EPA and GLA, alone or in combination, reduce cell survival by induction of apoptosis. Thus, induction of apoptosis by select dietary n-3 (EPA) and n-6 (GLA) polyunsaturated fatty acids may be the mechanism of the resolution of pulmonary inflammation in ARDS.","['Gillis, R C', 'Daley, B J', 'Enderson, B L', 'Karlstad, M D']","['Gillis RC', 'Daley BJ', 'Enderson BL', 'Karlstad MD']","['Division of Trauma and Critical Care, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Knoxville 37920, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022480402964966 [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.2002.6496 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 2002 Sep;107(1):145-53. doi: 10.1006/jsre.2002.6496.,,,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cognitive function diminishes in indices of attention, psychomotor speed, and learning and memory. These are collectively termed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC or neuroAIDS). Inoculation with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) causes profound immunosuppression (murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or MAIDS) in C57BL/6 mice. Previous studies show that the LP-BM5 MuLV impairs learning and memory without gross motor impairment. Since learning and memory performance deficits can be related to attention deficits, we assessed the effect of LP-BM5 MuLV infection on sustained attention performance using a two-choice serial reaction time task. This task required the animals to detect a visual stimulus presented randomly on the right or the left unit and respond by a nose-poke in the illuminated hole within a 5 s period for water reward. The LP-BM5 MuLV infected group, like the control group, improved sustained attention performance until 7 weeks of virus infection in all measures including choice accuracy, response omission, and correct response time. However, during the late stage of infection, LP-BM5 MuLV infected mice showed selective sustained attention performance deficits. From 8 weeks after LP-BM5 MuLV infection, the virus infected mice started to lose their improved sustained attention performance in response omission and began to make correct responses more slowly than the control mice when the duration of stimulus light was 5 s. Moreover, at 13 and 14 weeks after LP-BM5 MuLV infection, the virus infected group made correct choices significantly less accurately than the control group when duration of stimulus light was shortest (1 s). These data show that LP-BM5 MuLV infection causes not only the previously reported learning and memory deficits but also produces sustained attention performance deficits in mice.","['Lee, Buyean', 'Tumu, Phani', 'Paul, Ian A']","['Lee B', 'Tumu P', 'Paul IA']","['Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,IM,"['Animals', '*Attention', 'Behavior, Animal', '*Choice Behavior/physiology', 'Conditioning, Operant', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Organ Size', 'Photic Stimulation', '*Reaction Time', 'Reference Values', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*physiopathology']",2002/10/18 04:00,2002/11/01 04:00,['2002/10/18 04:00'],"['2002/10/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006899302029426 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(02)02942-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2002 Sep 6;948(1-2):1-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(02)02942-6.,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,"['DA12060/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'MH53228/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of occupation and industry-coded U.S. death certificate data from 26 states for the years 1984-1993 was conducted to evaluate mortality patterns among crop and livestock farmers. METHODS: Cause-specific proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) computer program designed to calculate sex and race specific PMRs for occupations and industries in population-based data. RESULTS: Among white male (WM) livestock farmers, there was a significantly higher mortality from cancer of the pancreas, prostate and brain, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma, acute and chronic lymphoid leukemia, and Parkinson's disease. WM crop farmers showed significantly higher mortality risk for cancer of the lip, skin, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphoid leukemia.

Especially during longstanding neutropenia, patients are at risk for life-threatening infections. The aim of this study was to assess the effect and safety of G-CSF mobilized granulocyte transfusions (GTX) in four neutropenic pediatric patients with sepsis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were between 4.6-17.5 years old and their diagnoses included very severe aplastic anemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute myeloid leukemia. Before GTX, all patients had fever despite antibiotic and antimycotic therapy, neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ANC < 500/microl), increasing C-reactive protein (CRP) values, hypotension requiring dopamine infusion and three patients needed supplemental oxygen. The granulocyte donors received G-CSF (Neupogen, 5 microg/kg body weight) 12 h prior to granulocyte apheresis. RESULTS: In total, 40 GTX were performed (range 2-28 per patient). The mean increase of the granulocyte count 1 h after GTX was 1,310/microl (range 200-2,950/microl). Within the period of GTX the CRP values decreased in all patients. During or 24 h after the last GTX, the hypotension resolved and supplemental oxygen was stopped. One GTX was discontinued because of oxygen desaturation. CONCLUSION: GTX were a safe therapeutic measure with beneficial effects on serious infections in neutropenic children.","['Grigull, L', 'Schrauder, A', 'Schmitt-Thomssen, A', 'Sykora, K', 'Welte, K']","['Grigull L', 'Schrauder A', 'Schmitt-Thomssen A', 'Sykora K', 'Welte K']","[""Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Medical School of Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany. lorenz.grigull@gmx.de""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Critical Illness', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fungemia/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/17 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/10/17 04:00'],"['2002/10/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s15010-002-2133-y [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2002 Oct;30(5):267-71. doi: 10.1007/s15010-002-2133-y.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we have shown that the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine induces apoptosis in a murine T-lymphocyte cell line. The aims of the present study were to expand these observations to human systems and to analyse the molecular basis for sulfasalazine-induced apoptosis. Sulfasalazine induces apoptosis both in Jurkat cells, a human T-leukaemia cell line (ED50 value approximately 1.0 mM), and in primary human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (ED50 value approximately 0.5 mM). In contrast SW620 colon carcinoma cells or primary human synoviocytes are not affected at these concentrations suggesting a cell type-specific sensitivity to sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine triggers the mitochondrial accumulation of Bax and induces a collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)). Sulfasalazine causes cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent activation of caspase-3 and downstream substrates. However, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk fails to inhibit sulfasalazine-induced apoptosis. Sulfasalazine stimulates mitochondrio-nuclear translocation of the novel apoptogenic factor apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and triggers large-scale DNA fragmentation, a characteristic feature of AIF-mediated apoptosis. Sulfasalazine-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss, AIF redistribution, and cell death are fully prevented by overexpression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, our data suggest that sulfasalazine-induced apoptosis of T-lymphocytes is mediated by mitochondrio-nuclear translocation of AIF and occurs in a caspase-independent fashion. Sulfasalazine-induced apoptosis by AIF and subsequent clearance of T-lymphocytes might thus provide the molecular basis for the beneficial therapeutic effects of sulfasalazine in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.","['Liptay, Susanne', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Schanbacher, Marta', 'Bourteele, Soizic', 'Ferri, Karine F', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Adler, Guido', 'Debatin, Klaus M', 'Schmid, Roland M']","['Liptay S', 'Fulda S', 'Schanbacher M', 'Bourteele S', 'Ferri KF', 'Kroemer G', 'Adler G', 'Debatin KM', 'Schmid RM']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Ulm, 89070 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Sulfasalazine/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",2002/10/17 04:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2002/10/17 04:00'],"['2002/10/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704870 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;137(5):608-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704870.,,,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)']",,,,,,PMC1573529,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the analytical validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay for the absolute quantitation of these two different WT1 transcripts with specific primers and probes that ensure specificity for each WT1 variant. By cloning each WT1 transcript in a T3 promoter-containing plasmid, we obtained two WT1 transcript-specific in vitro-generated RNA calibrators for absolute quantitation. Serial dilution of each RNA calibrator demonstrated a 5 log linear dynamic range (5 x 10(1) to 5 x 10(6) copies/reaction, R(2)=0.9963 for wtWT1 and R(2)=0.9993 for trWT1). Dilution of the calibrators in total RNA from 1 x 10(3) non-WT1-expressing cells showed a decreased sensitivity without affecting the linear dynamic range. Precision studies for values within the linear dynamic range showed a coefficient of variation of less than 4% for both transcripts.

The bone marrow biopsy is very hypocellular in aplastic anemia, but it is usually hypercellular in myelodysplastic syndrome. Marrow cytogenetic abnormalities are present in approximately half of myelodysplastic syndrome patients but are absent in aplastic anemia. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for young patients with severe aplastic anemia. Immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine is used when transplantation is not the initial therapeutic choice; it induces responses in 65% to 80% of patients. Treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome is dependent upon risk classification, and patient age and performance status. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered for younger myelodysplastic syndrome patients. An acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) type of induction chemotherapy may benefit high-risk patients with a good performance status for whom allogeneic transplantation is not an option.

Since the renal tubule is the major tissue affected in the course of HUS and Stx2 is known to be toxic to the renal tubular cells (RTC), we attempted to elucidate the mechanism of renal injury in HUS by studying the alteration of cytokines in the RTC evoked by Stx2. cDNA-array is a powerful tool for evaluating changes in the expression of a group of critical genes and also gives insights on the overview of the gene activation. In this study, we purified Stx2 from the E. coli O157:7, which was isolated from a typical diarrhea-associated HUS patient and then tried to compare the cytokine gene expression between the stimulated RTC and un-stimulated RTC using cDNA-array. Our results showed that one third of the examined cytokine genes were up regulated at least twice by the addition of Vtx2. These up-regulated genes represented the chemokines (macrophage related cytokines), fibrosis-related cytokine (TNF, PDGF) and leukemia inhibitory factors. However, the expression of IL-6, one of the pleiotropic cytokines, was significantly decreased and this finding was confirmed by northern analysis. Our results suggest that VT2 up-regulates the pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis prone growth factors in RTC and that the inhibition of the activation of these cytokines may ameliorate the renal tubular injury in the HUS caused by E. coli O157:7.","['Lee, Ji Eun', 'Kim, Jung Sim', 'Choi, In Hyung', 'Tagawa, Manabu', 'Kohsaka, Takao', 'Jin, Dong Kyu']","['Lee JE', 'Kim JS', 'Choi IH', 'Tagawa M', 'Kohsaka T', 'Jin DK']","['Department of Clinical Research Center, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ren Fail,Renal failure,8701128,IM,"['Cytokines/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Escherichia coli O157/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kidney Tubules/*drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Shiga Toxin 2/*adverse effects/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2002/10/17 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2002/10/17 04:00'],"['2002/10/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/jdi-120013959 [doi]'],ppublish,Ren Fail. 2002 Sep;24(5):567-75. doi: 10.1081/jdi-120013959.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may improve outcome by rapid achievement of complete remission (CR) and possible avoidance of late myelodysplasia as a consequence of non-transplant induction chemotherapy. Thirty untreated patients received 1 g/m(2) methylprednisolone daily (days 1-6) and 12-16 micro g/kg G-CSF daily (days 3-6), and underwent leukapheresis on days 6 and 7. The median CD34(+) cell yield was 1.31 x10(6)/kg (range, 0.23-5.63), and was > or =1 x10(6)/kg in 73%. Cell yields were significantly lower than in 82 historical controls apheresed after completion of induction chemotherapy (median 2.16 x 10(6)/kg), and improved in patients who were apheresed again after induction chemotherapy. Three patients received primary therapy with HDM200 and autograft using these cells and attained CR.

Apoptosis is tightly regulated by the competitive effect of numerous proteins displaying either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity. The ETS-family transcription factor FLI-1, frequently associated with malignant transformation, has been shown to display anti-apoptotic activity in several cell types including avian erythroblasts, mouse fibroblasts or lymphoid cells. We show here that apoptosis of murine preB leukemic cells is accompanied with the specific cleavage of FLI-1 by a caspase-like activity. We also demonstrate that the two isoforms of FLI-1 are indeed cleaved at three conserved sites by caspase 3 in vitro. The conservation of these cleavage sites among species suggests that the caspase cleavage of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor FLI-1 may represent a critical step to ensure irreversible cell death.","['Sarrazin, Sandrine', 'Bonod-Bidaud, Christelle', 'Remy, Pierre', 'Mehlen, Patrick', 'Morle, Francois']","['Sarrazin S', 'Bonod-Bidaud C', 'Remy P', 'Mehlen P', 'Morle F']","['Transcription/Differenciation Hematopoietique and Apoptose/Differenciation, label la ligue contre le cancer-Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 5534, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/16 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488902002902 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00290-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Oct 21;1592(2):123-7. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00290-2.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression can be further enhanced by interleukin 4 (IL-4). We have shown before that in B-CLL cells nuclear factor(s) of activated T cells (NF-ATs) show permanent nuclear localization and therefore constitutive transcriptional activity. Here we identify CD23b promoter as a novel target for NF-AT factors in B-CLL cells. The CD23b promoter contains two NF-AT binding sites to which NF-ATp and NF-ATc factors bind with high affinity. Mutations introduced into these sites abolished NF-AT binding and impaired the promoter activity, as did cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of nuclear transport of NF-ATs. Furthermore, we show that IL-4-induced transcription factor STAT6 cooperates with NF-ATs in the induction of the CD23b promoter activity. These results show that the CD23b promoter is a target for NF-AT factors and suggest that the cooperation between NF-AT and STAT factors might be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for high-level expression of CD23 on the surface of B-CLL cells.","['Kneitz, Christian', 'Goller, Martin', 'Tony, Hans', 'Simon, Andreas', 'Stibbe, Corinne', 'Konig, Thomas', 'Serfling, Edgar', 'Avots, Andris']","['Kneitz C', 'Goller M', 'Tony H', 'Simon A', 'Stibbe C', 'Konig T', 'Serfling E', 'Avots A']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wuerzburg, Klinikstrasse. 6-8, 97070, Wuerzburg, Germany. c.kneitz@medizin.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/16 04:00,2002/12/19 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S092544390200114X [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00114-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Oct 9;1588(1):41-7. doi: 10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00114-x.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one of them, we also found deletion at 3p21.3 with cosNRL9 probe, which is included in a 370-kb lung cancer homologous deletion region. However, due to scantiness of the patient materials at that time, we could not determine the precise breakpoint at 1p36 or 3p21 in any of the patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of PRV-1 in granulocytes isolated from 37 patients with ET, 37 patients with PV, 25 patients with ST, 10 patients with SE, 25 patients with secondary leukocytosis (SL), five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), five patients with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM), five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 20 normal individuals by PRV-1-specific RT-PCR. In female patients, PRV-1 expression was correlated with clonality analysis as assessed by the human androgen receptor polymorphism assay. RESULTS: PRV-1 was not expressed in granulocytes isolated from normal individuals or from patients with ST, SE, CML, IM, MDS, and inflammatory/infectious SL. On the contrary, all ET patients, 35 of 37 PV patients, and five patients with acute postsurgery and posttraumatic SL overexpressed PRV-1. All the cases with monoclonal hematopoiesis (17 of 21 with ET and 12 of 12 with PV) expressed PRV-1, yet PRV-1 overexpression extended also over the cases of ET showing polyclonal hematopoiesis (four of 20). CONCLUSION: The overexpression of PRV-1 seems to be a useful tool for discriminating ET and PV from ST and SE, thus offering an innovative diagnostic approach on the basis of the detection of positive diagnostic criteria instead of exclusion criteria.","['Teofili, Luciana', 'Martini, Maurizio', 'Luongo, Myriam', 'Di Mario, Antonella', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'De Stefano, Valerio', 'Larocca, Luigi Maria']","['Teofili L', 'Martini M', 'Luongo M', 'Di Mario A', 'Leone G', 'De Stefano V', 'Larocca LM']","['Istituto di Ematologia and Istituto di Anatomia Patologica, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, Androgen', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/genetics']",2002/10/16 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.11.507 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Oct 15;20(20):4249-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.11.507.,,,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (CD177 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine pediatric patients with newly diagnosed primary AML received a 5-day course of ara-C 500 mg/m(2)/d and 2-CdA 9 mg/m(2)/d. They were randomly assigned to receive ara-C as either a 2-hour daily infusion (arm A) or a continuous infusion (arm B). Cellular pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 2. All patients then received two courses of remission induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, ara-C, and etoposide (DAV). RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of patients (seven of 22) in arm A and 63% (17 of 27) in arm B entered complete remission (P =.045) after ara-C and 2-CdA therapy. Coadministration of 2-CdA increased the intracellular concentration of ara-CTP in 20 of 36 patients, although we found no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in this effect (P =.63). The incidence of toxicity did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms (P =.53). After two courses of DAV, the rate of complete remission was 91% in arm A and 96% in arm B (P =.58). CONCLUSION: Intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP is increased when 2-CdA is given with ara-C, but no schedule-dependent differences in this effect were seen. The combination of 2-CdA and ara-C seems to be effective therapy for pediatric AML.","['Crews, Kristine R', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Tong, Xin', 'Behm, Fred G', 'Plunkett, William', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Ribeiro, Raul C']","['Crews KR', 'Gandhi V', 'Srivastava DK', 'Razzouk BI', 'Tong X', 'Behm FG', 'Plunkett W', 'Raimondi SC', 'Pui CH', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Stewart CF', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. kristine.rews@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",2002/10/16 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.10.006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Oct 15;20(20):4217-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.10.006.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV regimen']",,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients received four cycles of cisplatin at 80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 with arm 1: gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and 600 mg/m(2) on days 43, 50, 64, and 71; arm 2: paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2) for 3 hours on days 1 and 22 and 135 mg/m(2) on days 43 and 64; and arm 3: vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and 15 mg/m(2) on days 43, 50, 64, and 71. Radiotherapy was initiated on day 43 at 2 Gy/d (total dose, 66 Gy). RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five eligible patients were analyzed. Toxicities during induction chemotherapy consisted primarily of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities during concomitant chemoradiotherapy consisted of thrombocytopenia, granulo-cytopenia, and esophagitis. Response rates after completion of radiotherapy were 74%, 67%, and 73% for arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Median survival for all patients was 17 months. One-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates for the patients on the three arms were 68%/37%/28%, 62%/29%/19%, and 65%/40%/23%. CONCLUSION: Four cycles of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin can be administered at these doses and schedules. The observed survival rates exceed those of previous CALGB trials and may be attributable to the use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy added to concomitant chemoradiotherapy is being evaluated in a phase III randomized trial.","['Vokes, Everett E', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Leopold, Kenneth A', 'Perry, Michael C', 'Miller, Antonius A', 'Green, Mark R']","['Vokes EE', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Crawford J', 'Leopold KA', 'Perry MC', 'Miller AA', 'Green MR']","['University of Chicago Medical Center and Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, IL, USA. evokes@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Vinorelbine']",2002/10/16 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.03.054 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Oct 15;20(20):4191-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.03.054.,,,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two eligible patients with classic or prolymphocytic HCL (33 non-pretreated patients, 15 patients with relapse after previous treatment, and 14 patients with progressive disease during a treatment other than CDA) were treated with CDA 0.14 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous bolus injections for five consecutive days. Response status was repeatedly assessed according to the Consensus Resolution criteria. RESULTS: Complete and partial remissions were seen in 47 (76%) and 13 (21%) patients, respectively, for a response rate of 97%. All responses were achieved with a single treatment course. Most responses occurred early (i.e. within 10 weeks) after start of CDA therapy, but response quality improved during weeks and even months after treatment completion. The median time to treatment failure for all patients was 38 months. Leukopenia was the main toxicity. Granulocyte nadir (median 0.2 x 10(9)/l) was strongly associated with the incidence of infections (P = 0.0013). Non-specific lymphopenia occurred early after CDA treatment, and normal lymphocytes recovered slowly over several months. No significant associations were found between infections and nadir count of lymphocytes or any lymphocyte subpopulation. No opportunistic infections were observed. CONCLUSIONS: One course of CDA given by subcutaneous bolus injections is very effective in HCL. The subcutaneous administration is more convenient for patients and care providers, and has a similar toxicity profile to continuous intravenous infusion. The subcutaneous administration of CDA is a substantial improvement and should be offered to every patient with HCL requiring treatment with CDA.","['von Rohr, A', 'Schmitz, S-F H', 'Tichelli, A', 'Hess, U', 'Piguet, D', 'Wernli, M', 'Frickhofen, N', 'Konwalinka, G', 'Zulian, G', 'Ghielmini, M', 'Rufener, B', 'Racine, C', 'Fey, M F', 'Cerny, T', 'Betticher, D', 'Tobler, A']","['von Rohr A', 'Schmitz SF', 'Tichelli A', 'Hess U', 'Piguet D', 'Wernli M', 'Frickhofen N', 'Konwalinka G', 'Zulian G', 'Ghielmini M', 'Rufener B', 'Racine C', 'Fey MF', 'Cerny T', 'Betticher D', 'Tobler A']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern. avonrohr@onkozentrum.ch']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival']",2002/10/16 04:00,2003/04/19 05:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf272 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63766-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Oct;13(10):1641-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf272.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,,,,,,"['Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK), Bern, Switzerland']",,,,,,,,,,

In order to detect a possible influence of cigarette smoking on initial characteristics at the time of presentation and on the course of the disease, we conducted a retrospective study in 643 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 339 males and 304 females (median age 59 years, range 18-84 years). Two hundred and ninety-six patients (46%), smoking at least one cigarette per day for 6 months, were considered as smokers, while 347 patients (54%) were non-smokers. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was significantly related to male gender (P <0.0001), professional occupancy (P = 0.002), presence of organomegaly (P = 0.01), and lower peripheral blood and bone marrow leukemic cell involvement (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Leukemia of French-American-British (FAB) M1 subtype was more frequent in non-smokers (P = 0.005). Although not statistically significant, smokers tended to have lower leukocyte counts than non-smokers. No difference was noted in terms of complete remission rates between smokers and non-smokers (67% compared to 64%). However, a higher rate of severe pulmonary infection was observed in smokers during induction chemotherapy (P = 0.02). Cigarette smoking (>or=20 pack-years or smoking duration >or=30 years) was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.03) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.02 and P = 0.004, respectively). Other characteristics associated with poor prognosis included mainly older age, unfavorable karyotype, secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and elevated World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. Cigarette smoking was associated with shorter OS in younger adults, but did not significantly influence survival in patients >60 years old. Cigarette smoking worsened the poor OS in patients with unfavorable karyotype, but did not significantly influence the prognosis of other karyotypic risk groups. In a multivariate analysis, only karyotypic grouping and age remained of prognostic value for the occurrence of disease-free and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking has a deleterious effect on survival in AML by shortening complete remission duration and subsequent survival. It was associated with severe infections during aplasia. Leukemogenic compounds favoring complex karyotypic abnormalities could also be involved.","['Chelghoum, Y', 'Danaila, C', 'Belhabri, A', 'Charrin, C', 'Le, Q-H', 'Michallet, M', 'Fiere, D', 'Thomas, X']","['Chelghoum Y', 'Danaila C', 'Belhabri A', 'Charrin C', 'Le QH', 'Michallet M', 'Fiere D', 'Thomas X']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",2002/10/16 04:00,2003/04/19 05:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf269 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63763-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Oct;13(10):1621-7. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf269.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: According to established diagnostic criteria, 155 CML patients were divided into 3 groups and 3 clinical phases were identified on the basis of their Sokal scores. The bone marrow was obtained for G banding and karyotype analysis. RESULTS: It was found that 148 patients (95.5%) carried Ph1 chromosome. Among the other 7 cases without Ph1 chromosome, 4 were identified as being bcr/abl fusion gene positive. The ratio of additional cytogenetic abnormalities were higher in patients in blast crisis or accelerated phase than in patients in chronic phase. CONCLUSION: CML consists of a group of diseases with high heterogeneity, and the prognoses of the patients mostly depend on the malignancy of the tumor. The occurrence of additional chromosomal abnormality is highly correlative with the risk index and clinical staging of the patients, which may serve prognostic purposes. Conventional cytogenetic analysis may help evaluate the therapeutic effect and make subsequent clinical decisions, and may also facilitate new karyotype identification.","['Du, Qing-Feng', 'Liu, Xiao-Li', 'Song, Lan-Lin', 'Zhang, Song', 'Zhou, Shu-Yu']","['Du QF', 'Liu XL', 'Song LL', 'Zhang S', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",2002/10/16 04:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2002 Oct;22(10):905-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study group consisted of 212 cases and 202 controls from the London et al. (1991) study of childhood leukemia conducted in the Los Angeles area during 1978 to 1984. Using GIS methods, traffic counts on all streets within 1500 feet of each subject's residence of longest duration were determined. From these counts, an integrated distance-weighted traffic density measure was calculated for each subject for use as the analytic variable. Additional information, including magnetic fields and wire-code, was obtained from the original case-control study. Association between traffic density and leukemia, and confounding and effect modification by other variables, were assessed using standard matched case-control analyses. RESULTS: Although the unadjusted traffic density-childhood leukemia rate ratios were slightly elevated, this weak association was explained by confounding by wire code. Wire code remained associated with leukemia after controlling for traffic density. There was little evidence of effect modification between traffic density and magnetic fields, wire code or other variables. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of an association of traffic density with childhood leukemia in the Los Angeles case-control study.","['Langholz, Bryan', 'Ebi, Kristie L', 'Thomas, Duncan C', 'Peters, John M', 'London, Stephanie J']","['Langholz B', 'Ebi KL', 'Thomas DC', 'Peters JM', 'London SJ']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9011, USA. langholz@hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Motor Vehicles/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Vehicle Emissions/adverse effects']",2002/10/16 04:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/10/16 04:00'],"['2002/10/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1047279701003179 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(01)00317-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2002 Oct;12(7):482-7. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(01)00317-9.,,,['0 (Vehicle Emissions)'],,,['5P30ES07048-05/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL B cells possess the ability to process and present tumor antigens but lack expression of costimulatory molecules, rendering them inefficient effectors of T-cell activation. We previously demonstrated that helper virus-free preparations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) amplicon vectors encoding CD40L efficiently transduce CLL B cells and render them capable of eliciting specific anti-tumor T-cell responses. LIGHT (TNFSF14), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, efficiently activates both T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We employed an HSV amplicon vector expressing human LIGHT (hf-HSV-LIGHT) to transduce CLL B cells and compared the immunomodulatory function and T-cell activation induced by hf-HSV-LIGHT transduction to that observed with a CD40L-expressing HSV amplicon (hf-HSV-CD40L). hf-HSV-LIGHT transduction induced expression of endogenous B7.1, B7.2, and ICAM.1 on CLL cells, albeit to a lesser degree than that observed in response to transduction with hf-HSV-CD40L. hf-HSV-LIGHT enhanced the antigen-presenting capacity of CLL B cells, as measured by induction of T-cell proliferation in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte tumor reaction. Finally, hf-HSV-LIGHT-transduced CLL B cells successfully stimulated the outgrowth of autologous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vitro. In aggregate, these data suggest that hf-HSV-LIGHT transduction may be useful for induction of immune responses to CLL and other B-cell lymphoid malignancies.","['Tolba, Khaled A', 'Bowers, William J', 'Eling, David J', 'Casey, Ann E', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Federoff, Howard J', 'Rosenblatt, Joseph D']","['Tolba KA', 'Bowers WJ', 'Eling DJ', 'Casey AE', 'Kipps TJ', 'Federoff HJ', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['James P.

Maximum transgene expression was observed 3 weeks postinjection for LCMV-6. Importantly, HA and VSV-G pseudotyped SIV lead to such a high level of transgene expression that GFP-related toxicity occurred.

Disease-related factors and treatment-related toxicity are believed to play causative roles. We wanted to elucidate the etiology further by serial EEG examinations and parallel CSF amino acid analyses. PROCEDURE: Twenty-nine children participated in the study. EEG examinations with quantitative computerized analysis were scheduled on day 1, 10, 29, and 59 of protocol I of BFM-ALL 90 and 95 Study Protocols. CSF analysis for amino acids was carried out on day 1, 15, 29, 45, and 59. RESULTS: A total of 21 of 25 available EEGs showed slight-to-moderate slowing already at diagnosis. The abundance of slow waves was significantly correlated to the white blood count and the CSF glutamine concentration. The EEGs significantly worsened during the first 10 days of treatment with prednisone, VCR, daunorubicin, and intrathecal methotrexate. The following treatment including asparaginase (ASP) gave rise to depletion of CSF from asparagine and a rise of aspartate; glutamine, and glutamate did not follow this pattern. The EEGs remained abnormal, but did not worsen further; the CSF amino acid changes were not related to the EEG. During the subsequent consolidation treatment, the EEGs normalized despite administration of cyclophosphamide, cytara bine, intrathecal methotrexate, and mercaptopurin. CONCLUSIONS: The greater part of EEG changes observed in the early treatment of ALL is due to disease-related factors. Treatment with prednisone, vincristine, and to a much lesser degree asparaginase aggravates the pre-existing encephalopathy. Depletion of CSF from asparagine does not give rise to additional changes. In the second month, the EEG normalizes despite ongoing treatment with different cytotoxic drugs.","['Korinthenberg, Rudolf', 'Scheuring, Bernadette', 'Boos, Joachim', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte']","['Korinthenberg R', 'Scheuring B', 'Boos J', 'Niemeyer C']","['Department of Neuropediatrics and Muscular Disorders, Pediatric University Hospital Freiburg, Mathildenstrasse, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany. rudokori@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acids/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electroencephalography/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2002/10/12 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/12 04:00'],"['2002/10/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10189 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Dec;39(6):566-72. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10189.,,,['0 (Amino Acids)'],"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with T-ALL frequently present with unfavorable features at diagnosis and thus are considered to have a higher risk to relapse. Within the last 10 years, the previously dismal prognosis of this ALL subtype has been improved by intensified chemotherapy. However, 30-40% of patients still relapse, so that additional prognostic factors such as the local response of the mediastinal mass to therapy might allow defining the patients at risk in a better manner. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis of 116 Austrian patients with T-ALL was performed to assess whether an initial mediastinal mass (70/116) and its response to chemotherapy as measured by thoracic X-rays (32/70) might predict outcome. RESULTS: Neither patients with a mediastinal tumor at the time of diagnosis nor patients with an incomplete response on day 35 or 70 of therapy had a worse prognosis, as compared with the group of patients with no initial tumor and complete regression on day 35 and 70. CONCLUSIONS: We failed to show that in children with T-ALL residual mediastinal tumors are of prognostic relevance. This might suggest that incomplete local response is not necessarily an indication for treatment intensification such as local irradiation, second-look operation, or high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescue. However, due to the relatively small number of patients analyzed, our results have to be validated prospectively on a larger cohort of patients in future clinical trials.","['Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Mann, Georg', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Wiesbauer, Peter', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Gadner, Helmut']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Mann G', 'Dworzak M', 'Wiesbauer P', 'Schrappe M', 'Gadner H']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/12 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/12 04:00'],"['2002/10/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10164 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Dec;39(6):558-65. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10164.,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its incidence peaks in children just before school entry age; i.e., in 2-3 year olds. It is known to be more common in white children in the USA; the incidence is also higher in boys than girls. PROCEDURE: We reviewed the 5,379 cases of ALL among persons under 20 years of age in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. RESULTS: The overall incidence of ALL was 26/10(6) person-years between 1973 and 1998, but increased from 19/10(6) person-years in 1973-77 to 28/10(6) person-years in 1993-98 (P < 0.0001). Rates were 44% higher among Whites compared to Blacks (27/10(6) person-years vs. 15/10(6) person-years, P < 0.0001). In 1992-1998, the incidence rate for Hispanics was 43/10(6) person-years, significantly higher than non-Hispanics (28/10(6), P < 0.0001). White children with ALL had better 5-year survival rates than Black children with ALL (71% vs. 58%, P < 0.0001), and 5-year survival was poorest among black males. CONCLUSIONS: ALL incidence has increased over the examined 25-year period. The rate in US whites is higher than that of US Blacks, and the rates in the Hispanic subgroup are the highest of all. While the median survival period is now more than 10 years overall, the 5-year survival rate remains poor for Black males under 4 years of age. Socioeconomic factors do not account for this difference, which may relate to ALL subtype distribution.","['McNeil, Dawn Elizabeth', 'Cote, Timothy R', 'Clegg, Limin', 'Mauer, Alvin']","['McNeil DE', 'Cote TR', 'Clegg L', 'Mauer A']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute/NIH, EPS Room 7125, 6120 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7236, Rockville, MD 20892-7236, USA. mcneile@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Prognosis', '*SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",2002/10/12 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/12 04:00'],"['2002/10/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10161 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Dec;39(6):554-7; discussion 552-3. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10161.,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Nov;41(5):413-4.

RESULT: Treatment protocol utilizing HA was incapable of lengthening the duration of chronic phase (DCP) of CML, regardless of its better short-term effect than that of Hu. The impact of risk profile of the patients on clinical remission rate and DCP was more significant than that of the therapy protocols. CONCLUSION: HA should not be used as the first-line protocol in the treatment of CML patients in chronic phase who have not received any previous medical intervention.

It targets both topoisomerase (topo) I and II, but the roles of each of these enzymes in the antitumour action of DACA are not known. We have used a series of DACA analogues (mainly monosubstituted halogen derivatives) to relate in vitro and in vivo biological activity. We measured topo II selectivity by comparing the inhibition of Jurkat human leukaemia cell lines with high and low topo II content. We determined survival curves following exposure of H460 human lung carcinoma cells for 1 h. We used plasmid DNA to compare the effects of DACA analogues on isolated topo I and II, measuring in particular the inhibition of topo I- and II-mediated DNA relaxation. The results indicate that 5-halogen substituted derivatives are the most active in clonogenic cytotoxicity assays and that this activity is related to their selective activity towards Jurkat cells with high topo II activity. In isolated topo assays, 5-halogen substituted derivatives were also the most potent and in each case the concentration required for inhibition of topo II relaxation was greater than that for inhibition of topo I relaxation. The drug concentration providing efficient cytotoxicity corresponded to that which suppressed the activity of topo I but not of topo II. We hypothesize that DACA analogues act both in vitro and in vivo to simultaneously poison topo II and inhibit topo I catalytic activity, and that this combination contributes to the high antitumour activity of DACA analogues.","['Bridewell, D J', 'Finlay, G J', 'Baguley, B C']","['Bridewell DJ', 'Finlay GJ', 'Baguley BC']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Science, The University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/10/12 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/12 04:00'],"['2002/10/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 2001 Dec;16(6):317-24.,,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cl-DACA)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-two CD34+ cell selections from patients with follicular lymphoma (n = 14), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 6), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (n = 1) were performed by use of a magnetic cell selector followed by a negative cell selection step with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody bound to immunomagnetic beads. RESULTS: The PBPC components contained median CD34+ cells of 1.24 percent (range, 0.38-3.92%) and CD19+ cells of 1.83 percent (range, 0.06-69.7%). After positive selection (n = 22), 49 percent (range, 16-72%) of CD34+ cells were recovered with a purity of 93 percent (range, 24-99%). The double-positive and -negative selections (n = 20) yielded 57.5 percent of CD34+ cells (range, 33.4-79.4%) with a purity of 95 percent (range, 63-99%). Logarithms of B-cell reduction in the CD34+-cell-enriched B-cell-depleted component had a median value of 3.63 (range, 2.74-4.84 log) and CD19+ and CD5+ cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with more than 4.56 log (>3.6-5.6 log). Of 13 PBPC components that had a tumor-specific clonal signal, 10 became PCR negative after the double-selection procedure. CONCLUSION: Combined positive and negative magnetic cell selection achieves a high grade of tumor cell reduction with up to 77 percent of the grafts being negative for tumor-specific clonal signal by PCR analysis. This technique preserves an adequate recovery of progenitor cells able to engraft.","['Martin-Henao, G A', 'Picon, M', 'Rueda, F', 'Amill, B', 'Querol, S', 'Gonzalez-Barca, E', 'Ferra, C', 'Granena, A', 'Garcia, J']","['Martin-Henao GA', 'Picon M', 'Rueda F', 'Amill B', 'Querol S', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Ferra C', 'Granena A', 'Garcia J']","['Department of Cryobiology and Cell Therapy, Duran and Reynals Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. gmartinh@iro.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunomagnetic Separation/standards', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/standards', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods/standards']",2002/10/12 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/12 04:00'],"['2002/10/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00146.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2002 Jul;42(7):912-20. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00146.x.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider the Gamel-Boag (GB) model, a log-normal model for accelerated failure in which a proportion of subjects are long-term survivors. When the CPH model is fit to simulated data generated from this model, the results can range from gross overstatement of the effect size, to a situation where increasing follow-up may cause a decline in power. We implement a fitting algorithm for the GB model that permits separate covariate effects on the rapidity of early failure and the fraction of long-term survivors. When effects are detected by both the CPH and GB methods, the attribution of the effect to long-term or short-term survival may change the interpretation of the data.

This report presents new findings on selected components of cigarette smoke (including benzene and 1,3-butadiene) from major brands of cigarettes sold in Thailand, which represent about 80% of market share. Tested were also two major and popular brands of U.S. cigarettes sold in Thailand, representing about 100% of market share. The cigarettes tested were filter and non-filter, and with high and 'low' tar and nicotine levels. The observed range for benzene, toluene and 1,3-butadiene were found in the range of 25.5-63.7, 36.4-79.8 and 44.6-78.7 microg/cigarette, respectively. The amount of acrolein ranged from 79.9-181 microg/cigarette and for isoprene from 313-694 microg/cigarette. Yields of these substances showed no correlation with tar deliveries in mainstream smoke. Consumption of tobacco products increased in Thailand since 1970. This study also showed increases in leukemia mortality rates in Thailand, and in the relative frequency of leukemia among incident cancers diagnosed at a large hospital in Bangkok. Exposure to benzene and related compounds in cigarette smoke may have contributed to these trends. Analytic epidemiological studies are needed on the relationship between these compounds in smoke from tobacco products used in Thailand. These preliminary findings support the need for voluntary and/or government-regulated reduction in smoke yields of benzene and related compounds in tobacco products, and for expanded smoking prevention and cessation efforts, in Thailand.","['Mitacek, Eugene J', 'Brunnemann, Klaus D', 'Polednak, Anthony P', 'Limsila, Thira', 'Bhothisuwan, Kris', 'Hummel, Charles F']","['Mitacek EJ', 'Brunnemann KD', 'Polednak AP', 'Limsila T', 'Bhothisuwan K', 'Hummel CF']","['Department of Life Sciences, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY 11568, USA. emitacek@iris.nyit.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Acrolein/analysis', 'Benzene/*analysis', 'Butadienes/analysis', 'Coal Tar/analysis', 'Female', '*Hemiterpenes', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', '*Pentanes', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Toluene/analysis']",2002/10/11 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2002/10/11 04:00'],"['2002/10/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2002 Nov-Dec;9(6):1399-403.,,,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Hemiterpenes)', '0 (Pentanes)', '0A62964IBU (isoprene)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', '7864XYD3JJ (Acrolein)', '8007-45-2 (Coal Tar)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,,['CA-25980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P53 protein expression is of prognostic significance in univariate analysis and when combine with Bcl-2 expression data it provides additional information about overall survival. p53 and Bcl-2 failed to provide additional prognostic information in multivariate analysis. None of the samples shows mutation in exon 5, 6, 7 and 8 of p53 gene. Contrary to previous reports, p53 negativity was associated with lower relapse-free survival.

Two supervised methods of analysis were used to identify the 20 best discriminating genes between the following cohorts: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); B-lineage versus T-lineage ALL; newly diagnosed B-lineage standard-risk versus high-risk ALL; and B-lineage leukemia harboring the TEL-AML 1 fusion versus patients without a molecularly characterized translocation. These methods identified overlapping sets of genes that segregated patients within described subgroups. Cross-validation demonstrated that the majority of patients could be correctly classified based on these genes alone, and hierarchical clustering grouped patients with similar clinical and biological disease features. The potential for select genes to discriminate patients was validated using real-time PCR in samples that were analyzed by microarray profiling and in other uniformly processed leukemic marrow samples. As expected, microarray technology can successfully segregate patients defined by traditional measures such as immunophenotype and cytogenetic alterations. However, among specific subgroups, this preliminary analysis also suggests that microarrays can identify unanticipated similarities and diversity in individual patients and thus may be useful in augmenting risk-group stratification in the future.","['Moos, Philip J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Carlson, Marlee A', 'Szabo, Aniko', 'Smith, Fiona E', 'Willman, Cheryl', 'Wei, Qi', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L']","['Moos PJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Carlson MA', 'Szabo A', 'Smith FE', 'Willman C', 'Wei Q', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL']","['Center for Children at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors']",2002/10/11 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2002/10/11 04:00'],"['2002/10/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Oct;8(10):3118-30.,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,"['2P30CA42014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HD01215-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA88361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review herein the clinical profile of this drug and the regulatory review leading to the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for the treatment of metastatic and/or unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We discuss the efficacy and side effects of imatinib mesylate in a Phase II trial of 147 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable malignant GISTs, the basis for marketing approval, and postmarketing commitments by the drug's manufacturer. RESULTS: Imatinib was assessed in a single, open-label trial involving one European center and three centers in the United States. Seventy-three patients were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg of imatinib daily, and 74 patients received 600 mg daily. At the study report cutoff date, an objective response was confirmed in 56 patients; the overall response rate for the combined study arms was 38% (95% confidence interval, 30-46%). These responses were all partial responses. There was no statistically significant difference in response rates between the two dose groups. Adverse events included edema, fluid retention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, skin rash, bone marrow suppression, bleeding, and elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin. Bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract or intratumoral sites occurred in 7 patients (5%) and was not correlated with thrombocytopenia or tumor bulk. The pharmacokinetics of imatinib in GIST patients were similar to those of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: On February 1, 2001, imatinib mesylate was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant metastatic and/or unresectable GISTs. The recommended dose is 400 or 600 mg daily.","['Dagher, Ramzi', 'Cohen, Martin', 'Williams, Gene', 'Rothmann, Mark', 'Gobburu, Jogarao', 'Robbie, Gabriel', 'Rahman, Atiqur', 'Chen, Gang', 'Staten, Ann', 'Griebel, Donna', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Dagher R', 'Cohen M', 'Williams G', 'Rothmann M', 'Gobburu J', 'Robbie G', 'Rahman A', 'Chen G', 'Staten A', 'Griebel D', 'Pazdur R']","['Division of Oncology Drug Products, United States Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20857, USA. dagherr@cder.fda.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/secondary/surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Approval', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2002/10/11 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2002/10/11 04:00'],"['2002/10/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Oct;8(10):3034-8.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BU) has demonstrated safety when administered at 0.8 mg/kg per dose i.v. every 6 hours x 16 doses. We evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of giving the same total daily i.v. BU dose (3.2 mg/kg) either divided as a twice-daily infusion or as a single infusion to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Twelve patients with hematologic malignant disease were treated; 7 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 4 patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 patient had chronic myelogenous leukemia. The first cohort (group A) received, on the basis of actual body weight, i.v. BU at 1.6 mg/kg per dose over 4 hours every 12 hours for 4 days (day -7 to day -4). The second cohort (group B) received 3.2 mg/kg per dose of i.v. BU (same total dose as group A) as a single infusion over 4 hours daily for 4 days. In both groups the i.v. BU was followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg daily for 2 days (day -3 and day -2). Blood specimens were collected on the first, fifth, and seventh doses for group A and on the first and fourth doses for group B to determine the disposition of i.v. BU. Peripheral blood stem cells (autologous in 7 cases and HLA-matched allogeneic in 5 cases) were given 2 days after completion of cyclophosphamide administration (day 0), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 microg/kg was started on the same day. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus plus methotrexate for recipients of allogeneic stem cells. One patient developed presumed fungal pneumonia and died of multisystem organ dysfunction on day +21 before hematologic reconstitution could be evaluated. Another was reported to have sudden death of undetermined cause at home on day 40. The remaining patients had engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >500/microL) at a median of 11 days and sustained platelet counts >20,000/microL at a median of 14 days. Significant regimen-related toxicity (grade III-IV) was limited to hepatic toxicity (2 cases) catheter infection (2 cases), epistaxis (3 cases), diarrhea (1 case), anorexia (1 case), mucositis (1 case), hyperglycemia (1 case), pneumonia (1 case), and sepsis (1). In group B there was 1 case of mild venoocclusive disease, which resolved without sequelae. No central nervous system or pulmonary toxicity was noted. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including clearance, half-life, maximum concentration, and area under the curve, demonstrated that the first dose profile was highly predictive of later dose PK profiles. No accumulation of the drug was noted. The change in dosing schedule did not increase toxicity or end-organ damage despite higher plasma concentration-times. Although further study for long-term efficacy is warranted, i.v. BU can be given safely with reproducible results on a twice-daily divided or single-daily dosing schedule to patients undergoing HSCT.","['Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Tran, Hai T', 'Albrecht, Federico', 'Lennon, Shari', 'Caldera, Humberto', 'Goodman, Mark S']","['Fernandez HF', 'Tran HT', 'Albrecht F', 'Lennon S', 'Caldera H', 'Goodman MS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Florida 33136, USA. hfernan1@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/11 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/10/11 04:00'],"['2002/10/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500094 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12374453 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(9):486-92. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12374453.,,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'BUCY-2 protocol']",,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(9):465-7.

BuCy2 in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,477-85,"Complete bioavailability of i.v. busulfan (Bu) provides dose assurance by reducing the interdose and interpatient variability in Bu systemic exposure (Bu-SE) associated with the oral formulation. We hypothesized that Bu-SE, represented by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), would correlate with treatment outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Therefore, we analyzed the risk of death, incidence of regimen-related toxicity, and incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) as functions of the per dose i.v. Bu AUC in 36 CML patients who received a HSCT from an HLA-matched family donor after the i.v. BuCy2 regimen. Per-dose Bu AUCs were calculated for each subject using data obtained for doses 1, 5, 9, and 13. Toxicity was evaluated using the modified National Cancer Institute criteria. Because no patient developed veno-occlusive disease, increased serum bilirubin was used to characterize hepatotoxicity. We found that the probabilities of developing gastrointestinal toxicity (P = .01), hepatotoxicity (P < .01), mucositis (P = .09), and aGVHD (P < .01) all increased with increasing AUC. Further, the risk of death was significantly lower for patients having a per-dose AUC between approximately 950 and 1520 microMol-min, whereas the risk increased sharply with either lower or higher AUC values. These data suggest that an optimal Bu therapeutic window, based on per-dose AUC, exists. Given the ability of i.v. Bu to provide a more consistent per-dose AUC, these results should be useful in designing future i.v.V Bu-based treatment protocols for stem cell transplantation.","['Andersson, Borje S', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Madden, Timothy', 'Couriel, Daniel', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Tran, Hai T', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Gajewski, James', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Andersson BS', 'Thall PF', 'Madden T', 'Couriel D', 'Wang X', 'Tran HT', 'Anderlini P', 'de Lima M', 'Gajewski J', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77005, USA. bandersson@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/standards', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/11 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/10/11 04:00'],"['2002/10/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500082 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12374452 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(9):477-85. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12374452.,,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'BUCY-2 protocol']",,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(9):465-7.

We have studied an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) preparative regimen comprising fludarabine (FLU) 50 mg/m2 on days -6 to -2 plus i.v. Bu 3.2 mg/kg daily in a 3-hour infusion on days -5 to -2. The regimen was given to 70 patients aged 15 to 64 years (median, 41 years) with hematologic malignancy. Thirty-six patients (51%) had high-risk malignancy, 28 (40%) had unrelated or genotypically mismatched related donors (alternate donors [AD]) and 29 (41%) received bone marrow rather than blood as stem cell source. Acute GVHD prevention comprised antithymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg over 3 days pretransplantation, cyclosporin A, and short-course methotrexate with folinic acid. Hepatic toxicity was transient and there was no clinically diagnosed veno-occlusive disease. Grade II stomatitis occurred in 49 patients (70%) and hemorrhagic cystitis in 9 patients (13%). One patient with subtherapeutic phenytoin levels had a convulsion 8 hours after the third i.v. Bu dose, but no other neurotoxicity was apparent. Incidence of acute GVHD grades II to IV was 8% and incidence of grade III-IV was 3%, with no deaths from this cause. Actuarial incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years is 38%. There were 2 cases of graft failure in unrelated donor BMT recipients, 1 of which was reversed by asecond transplantation. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-27 months), transplantation-related mortality at 100 days and 2 years was 2% and 5% for matched related donor (MRD) SCT and 8% and 19% for AD SCT, respectively (P = not significant). Relapse rates were 21% for 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission or chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (low-risk), 66% for 19 patients with high-risk AML, and 18% for 17 patients with other active malignancy. Projected disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years were 74% and 88% for low-risk disease, 26% and 37% for advanced AML, and 65% and 71% for other high-risk disease, respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies were done using 11 samples with the first and fourth doses of Bu. Kinetics were linear, and for the first and fourth doses, the half-lives were 2.60 +/- 0.44 and 2.57 +/- 0.36 hours, respectively. Clearances were 106.77 +/- 16.68 and 106.86 +/- 21.57 mL/min per m2, peak concentrations (Cmax) were 3.92 +/- 0.31 and 3.96 +/- 0.28 mcg/mL, and Bu areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) were 4866.51 +/- 771.42 and 4980 +/- 882.80 microM x min, respectively. Bu was completely cleared within 24 hours and the day 4 pharmacokinetic values were very similar to those on day 1 for every patient. The cumulative AUC was comparable to the target range established for p.o. Bu. This regimen incorporating once-daily i.v.

We used human monocytoid leukemia J6-2 cells and successfully induced differentiation by GM3. Because differentiation is accompanied by retarded growth rate and cell cycle is intimately related to phospholipid metabolism, so we explored how GM3 was related to phospholipid metabolism. By using [32P]Pi, [3H-CH3]choline, [3H-CH3]SAM, and [3H]inositol as radioactive tracers, we studied the turnover changes of phospholipids and their metabolites induced by GM3. For the morphological changes of differentiation to occur, the cells had to be treated with GM3 at a concentration of 50 microM for 5-6 days, but the phospholipid changes occurred at a very early stage of GM3 treatment (only 1 h). Our results indicate that GM3 stimulated PE methylation pathway inhibited both CDP-choline pathway and PI cycle.

In platelet count and FDP, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of DIC is good, but the specificity is low. Fibrinogen may be unsuitable for the diagnosis of DIC, because it increases of the inflammatory reaction. It is possible to theoretically diagnose DIC by increased tissue factor production. It is currently considered that hemostatic molecular marker should be utilized to diagnose DIC. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and soluble fibrin are reflected to hypercoagulable state, thrombomodulin to vascular endothelial cell injuries, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I to hypofibrinolytic state. In leukemia with DIC, hyperfibrinolysis and marked bleeding symptoms are often observed. In septicemia with DIC, hypofibrinolysis and severe organ failure often occur.
